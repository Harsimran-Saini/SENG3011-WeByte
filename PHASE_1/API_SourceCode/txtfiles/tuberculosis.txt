Notes from the Field: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among workers at two food processing facilities -- Ohio, 2018-2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020; 69: 1104-1105\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring 2018-2019, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) reported 3 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) [see footnote] in persons who worked in 2 food processing facilities. The National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center [see footnote] performed whole genome sequencing of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate from each patient; phylogenetic analysis revealed the isolates were genetically identical. Prompted by concern for MDR TB transmission associated with these workplaces and surrounding communities, ODH began an investigation in February 2019. CDC was invited to assist with the investigation and deployed a team to Ohio on [14 Apr 2019].\n\nThe CDC-ODH team, which included representatives from CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), reviewed medical and employment records, conducted principal informant interviews, and conducted a tour of one of the facilities (facility A) where the 3 patients worked. The 3rd patient also worked at a 2nd facility (facility B), which had closed as part of an unrelated business restructuring before the CDC-ODH team could begin its investigation; facility A remained operational throughout the investigation. A separate NIOSH team had visited facility B before it closed to conduct a health hazard evaluation following notification that one the facility's employees had MDR TB; observations from that visit were used to guide the exposure assessment of facility B employees. The index case occurred in a person born in one of the 30 countries designated by the World Health Organization as having a high prevalence of MDR TB (1). According to available work schedules, during the index patient's infectious period, the second and third patients had worked for at least 54 days and 7 days, [see footnote] respectively, on the same food production line as the index patient. The investigation team was unable to find any other potential transmission venues or common exposures among the three patients.\n\nNo additional cases of MDR TB related to this group of patients were identified. However, 971 contacts of the three MDR TB patients were identified, including 941 who were workplace contacts; the majority of contacts were non-U.S.-born persons. Contacts were prioritized according to levels of possible TB exposure; 478 contacts, including 448 workplace and 30 personal contacts, had the highest risk of exposure (high-priority contacts). [see footnote] As of April 26, 2019, a total of 160 (36%) of the 448 high-priority workplace contacts had been tested for TB infection, 59 (37%) of whom had positive results for a tuberculin skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assay test, both of which test for TB infection. Among those with positive test results, 19 (32%) began latent tuberculosis infection treatment (Table). Among the overall U.S. population, an estimated 21% of non-US-born persons have a positive tuberculin skin test in the United States, and 16% have a positive interferon-\u03b3 release assay result (2). The higher percentage of positive TB test results at the workplace provides evidence for likely workplace transmission. Based on principal informant interviews, likely contributors to the low level of TB testing and treatment for infection among contacts included difficulties in communication, perceived barriers to care, and mistrust of government authorities.\n\nAfter the investigation concluded on [26 Apr 2019], all 3 patients with MDR TB disease had either recovered or were continuing to recover, and no additional cases have been identified. ODH continues to work with its local partners to facilitate TB testing and treatment of contacts with latent TB infection and to monitor for new cases.\n\nMDR TB is rare in the United States (less than 3% of TB cases annually since 1993) (3,4); in 2018, there were 98 MDR TB cases in the United States out of a total of 9,025 TB cases (5). Although the TB transmission source for the index patient remains uncertain, the low prevalence of MDR TB in the United States and the absence of other genotype-matched TB cases in the national TB molecular surveillance database indicate that the patient was likely infected in the patient's country of origin. Given the nonspecific signs and symptoms of TB, health care providers should consider TB when examining persons with cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, fatigue, or loss of appetite, especially when the person has TB risk factors, including birth in areas with high rates of TB [see footnotes]. In addition, providers should consider prompt molecular detection of drug-resistance testing for TB patients with risk factors for drug-resistant TB [see footnotes]. Finally, public health agencies need to facilitate engagement with communities with higher rates of TB to build trust, which is important for successful disease investigations. Activities might include communicating in a culturally sensitive manner with community members, offering patients incentives for getting tested or treated, providing transportation to clinics, using mobile clinics, and conducting communitywide education efforts.\n\n[The full MMWR article, including the table, references and footnotes, is available at the source URL above. - Mod.ML]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant at least to isoniazid and rifampin, 2 cornerstone drugs used in the 1st-line TB treatment regimen.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020; 69: 1104-1105\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring 2018-2019, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) reported 3 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) [see footnote] in persons who worked in 2 food processing facilities. The National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center [see footnote] performed whole genome sequencing of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate from each patient; phylogenetic analysis revealed the isolates were genetically identical. Prompted by concern for MDR TB transmission associated with these workplaces and surrounding communities, ODH began an investigation in February 2019. CDC was invited to assist with the investigation and deployed a team to Ohio on [14 Apr 2019].\n\nThe CDC-ODH team, which included representatives from CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), reviewed medical and employment records, conducted principal informant interviews, and conducted a tour of one of the facilities (facility A) where the 3 patients worked. The 3rd patient also worked at a 2nd facility (facility B), which had closed as part of an unrelated business restructuring before the CDC-ODH team could begin its investigation; facility A remained operational throughout the investigation. A separate NIOSH team had visited facility B before it closed to conduct a health hazard evaluation following notification that one the facility's employees had MDR TB; observations from that visit were used to guide the exposure assessment of facility B employees. The index case occurred in a person born in one of the 30 countries designated by the World Health Organization as having a high prevalence of MDR TB (1). According to available work schedules, during the index patient's infectious period, the second and third patients had worked for at least 54 days and 7 days, [see footnote] respectively, on the same food production line as the index patient. The investigation team was unable to find any other potential transmission venues or common exposures among the three patients.\n\nNo additional cases of MDR TB related to this group of patients were identified. However, 971 contacts of the three MDR TB patients were identified, including 941 who were workplace contacts; the majority of contacts were non-U.S.-born persons. Contacts were prioritized according to levels of possible TB exposure; 478 contacts, including 448 workplace and 30 personal contacts, had the highest risk of exposure (high-priority contacts). [see footnote] As of April 26, 2019, a total of 160 (36%) of the 448 high-priority workplace contacts had been tested for TB infection, 59 (37%) of whom had positive results for a tuberculin skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assay test, both of which test for TB infection. Among those with positive test results, 19 (32%) began latent tuberculosis infection treatment (Table). Among the overall U.S. population, an estimated 21% of non-US-born persons have a positive tuberculin skin test in the United States, and 16% have a positive interferon-\u03b3 release assay result (2). The higher percentage of positive TB test results at the workplace provides evidence for likely workplace transmission. Based on principal informant interviews, likely contributors to the low level of TB testing and treatment for infection among contacts included difficulties in communication, perceived barriers to care, and mistrust of government authorities.\n\nAfter the investigation concluded on [26 Apr 2019], all 3 patients with MDR TB disease had either recovered or were continuing to recover, and no additional cases have been identified. ODH continues to work with its local partners to facilitate TB testing and treatment of contacts with latent TB infection and to monitor for new cases.\n\nMDR TB is rare in the United States (less than 3% of TB cases annually since 1993) (3,4); in 2018, there were 98 MDR TB cases in the United States out of a total of 9,025 TB cases (5). Although the TB transmission source for the index patient remains uncertain, the low prevalence of MDR TB in the United States and the absence of other genotype-matched TB cases in the national TB molecular surveillance database indicate that the patient was likely infected in the patient's country of origin. Given the nonspecific signs and symptoms of TB, health care providers should consider TB when examining persons with cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, fatigue, or loss of appetite, especially when the person has TB risk factors, including birth in areas with high rates of TB [see footnotes]. In addition, providers should consider prompt molecular detection of drug-resistance testing for TB patients with risk factors for drug-resistant TB [see footnotes]. Finally, public health agencies need to facilitate engagement with communities with higher rates of TB to build trust, which is important for successful disease investigations. Activities might include communicating in a culturally sensitive manner with community members, offering patients incentives for getting tested or treated, providing transportation to clinics, using mobile clinics, and conducting communitywide education efforts.\n\n[The full MMWR article, including the table, references and footnotes, is available at the source URL above. - Mod.ML]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant at least to isoniazid and rifampin, 2 cornerstone drugs used in the 1st-line TB treatment regimen.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020; 69: 1104-1105\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring 2018-2019, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) reported 3 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) [see footnote] in persons who worked in 2 food processing facilities. The National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center [see footnote] performed whole genome sequencing of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate from each patient; phylogenetic analysis revealed the isolates were genetically identical. Prompted by concern for MDR TB transmission associated with these workplaces and surrounding communities, ODH began an investigation in February 2019. CDC was invited to assist with the investigation and deployed a team to Ohio on [14 Apr 2019].\n\nThe CDC-ODH team, which included representatives from CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), reviewed medical and employment records, conducted principal informant interviews, and conducted a tour of one of the facilities (facility A) where the 3 patients worked. The 3rd patient also worked at a 2nd facility (facility B), which had closed as part of an unrelated business restructuring before the CDC-ODH team could begin its investigation; facility A remained operational throughout the investigation. A separate NIOSH team had visited facility B before it closed to conduct a health hazard evaluation following notification that one the facility's employees had MDR TB; observations from that visit were used to guide the exposure assessment of facility B employees. The index case occurred in a person born in one of the 30 countries designated by the World Health Organization as having a high prevalence of MDR TB (1). According to available work schedules, during the index patient's infectious period, the second and third patients had worked for at least 54 days and 7 days, [see footnote] respectively, on the same food production line as the index patient. The investigation team was unable to find any other potential transmission venues or common exposures among the three patients.\n\nNo additional cases of MDR TB related to this group of patients were identified. However, 971 contacts of the three MDR TB patients were identified, including 941 who were workplace contacts; the majority of contacts were non-U.S.-born persons. Contacts were prioritized according to levels of possible TB exposure; 478 contacts, including 448 workplace and 30 personal contacts, had the highest risk of exposure (high-priority contacts). [see footnote] As of April 26, 2019, a total of 160 (36%) of the 448 high-priority workplace contacts had been tested for TB infection, 59 (37%) of whom had positive results for a tuberculin skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assay test, both of which test for TB infection.

We, however, were not told in the news report at the time the exact number of elephant workers diagnosed with LTBI, if the diagnosis of LTBI in the elephant workers was made by use of tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; a blood test), or if the workers with LTBI were treated with antibiotics to prevent active TB disease from developing.

This herd, which is the 74th cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998, was identified through routine surveillance testing.\n\nBovine TB, a bacterial disease primarily affecting cattle, is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in Michigan's modified accredited zone (MAZ). The MAZ is a U.S. Department of Agriculture designation for Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. In the MAZ, contact with deer can be a potential source of bovine TB infection for cattle. Preventing deer from having access to cattle feed, feed storage, or watering areas is crucial for farmers in this area of Michigan and is a part of the wildlife biosecurity program overseen by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and its partners.\n\nAs part of MDARD's (Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) standard disease response, an investigation will be conducted to identify and test herds that had an association with the infected herd. In the MAZ, annual surveillance and movement testing are required of cattle producers, which helps detect disease early and prevent it from being moved off the farm.\n\n\"Although a great deal of work is being done by producers in this area of the state, MDARD, the Department of Natural Resources, and partner agencies to prevent bovine TB cases, we do still occasionally see newly infected herds,\" said Michigan's Assistant State Veterinarian Nancy Barr, DVM. \"Responding to them in an effective manner helps prevent further cases and protect the state's TB free status in the remainder of the state. MDARD and the DNR are working with farmers, hunters, and community members to preserve and maintain healthy cattle, healthy deer and healthy communities.\"\n\nAny questions about this herd can be directed to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development at 800-292-3939, and more information on bovine TB can be found at http://www.michigan.gov/bovinetb.\n\n[Byline: Jessica Strachan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is circulating in the cattle herds in Michigan. Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.\n\n\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\n\"The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.\n\n\"Signs\n-----\nQ. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?\nA. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.\n\nQ. What animals can it affect?\nA. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.\n\nQ. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?\nA. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.\n\nQ. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?\nA. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.\n\nQ. How does TB get into cattle herds\nA: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are\n\n- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or\n- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.\n\n\"The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.\"\n\nExtracted from https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/faq_bovine_tb_.pdf. -

This herd, which is the 74th cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998, was identified through routine surveillance testing.\n\nBovine TB, a bacterial disease primarily affecting cattle, is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in Michigan's modified accredited zone (MAZ). The MAZ is a U.S. Department of Agriculture designation for Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. In the MAZ, contact with deer can be a potential source of bovine TB infection for cattle. Preventing deer from having access to cattle feed, feed storage, or watering areas is crucial for farmers in this area of Michigan and is a part of the wildlife biosecurity program overseen by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and its partners.\n\nAs part of MDARD's (Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) standard disease response, an investigation will be conducted to identify and test herds that had an association with the infected herd. In the MAZ, annual surveillance and movement testing are required of cattle producers, which helps detect disease early and prevent it from being moved off the farm.\n\n\"Although a great deal of work is being done by producers in this area of the state, MDARD, the Department of Natural Resources, and partner agencies to prevent bovine TB cases, we do still occasionally see newly infected herds,\" said Michigan's Assistant State Veterinarian Nancy Barr, DVM. \"Responding to them in an effective manner helps prevent further cases and protect the state's TB free status in the remainder of the state. MDARD and the DNR are working with farmers, hunters, and community members to preserve and maintain healthy cattle, healthy deer and healthy communities.\"\n\nAny questions about this herd can be directed to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development at 800-292-3939, and more information on bovine TB can be found at http://www.michigan.gov/bovinetb.\n\n[Byline: Jessica Strachan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is circulating in the cattle herds in Michigan. Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.\n\n\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\n\"The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.\n\n\"Signs\n-----\nQ. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?\nA. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.\n\nQ. What animals can it affect?\nA. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.\n\nQ. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?\nA. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.\n\nQ. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?\nA. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.\n\nQ. How does TB get into cattle herds\nA: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are\n\n- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or\n- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.\n\n\"The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.\"\n\nExtracted from https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/faq_bovine_tb_.pdf. -

Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.\n\n\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\n\"The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.\n\n\"Signs\n-----\nQ. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?\nA. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.\n\nQ. What animals can it affect?\nA. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.\n\nQ. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?\nA. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.\n\nQ. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?\nA. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.\n\nQ. How does TB get into cattle herds\nA: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are\n\n- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or\n- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.\n\n\"The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.\"\n\nExtracted from https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/faq_bovine_tb_.pdf. -

This herd, which is the 74th cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998, was identified through routine surveillance testing.\n\nBovine TB, a bacterial disease primarily affecting cattle, is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in Michigan's modified accredited zone (MAZ). The MAZ is a U.S. Department of Agriculture designation for Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. In the MAZ, contact with deer can be a potential source of bovine TB infection for cattle.

Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.\n\n\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\n\"The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.\n\n\"Signs\n-----\nQ. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?\nA. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.\n\nQ. What animals can it affect?\nA. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.\n\nQ. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?\nA. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.\n\nQ. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?\nA. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.\n\nQ. How does TB get into cattle herds\nA: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are\n\n- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or\n- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.\n\n\"The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.\"\n\nExtracted from https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/faq_bovine_tb_.pdf. -

This herd, which is the 74th cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998, was identified through routine surveillance testing.\n\nBovine TB, a bacterial disease primarily affecting cattle, is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in Michigan's modified accredited zone (MAZ). The MAZ is a U.S. Department of Agriculture designation for Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. In the MAZ, contact with deer can be a potential source of bovine TB infection for cattle. Preventing deer from having access to cattle feed, feed storage, or watering areas is crucial for farmers in this area of Michigan and is a part of the wildlife biosecurity program overseen by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and its partners.\n\nAs part of MDARD's (Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) standard disease response, an investigation will be conducted to identify and test herds that had an association with the infected herd. In the MAZ, annual surveillance and movement testing are required of cattle producers, which helps detect disease early and prevent it from being moved off the farm.\n\n\"Although a great deal of work is being done by producers in this area of the state, MDARD, the Department of Natural Resources, and partner agencies to prevent bovine TB cases, we do still occasionally see newly infected herds,\" said Michigan's Assistant State Veterinarian Nancy Barr, DVM. \"Responding to them in an effective manner helps prevent further cases and protect the state's TB free status in the remainder of the state. MDARD and the DNR are working with farmers, hunters, and community members to preserve and maintain healthy cattle, healthy deer and healthy communities.\"\n\nAny questions about this herd can be directed to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development at 800-292-3939, and more information on bovine TB can be found at http://www.michigan.gov/bovinetb.\n\n[Byline: Jessica Strachan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is circulating in the cattle herds in Michigan. Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.\n\n\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\n\"The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.\n\n\"Signs\n-----\nQ. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?\nA. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.\n\nQ. What animals can it affect?\nA. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.\n\nQ. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?\nA. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.\n\nQ. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?\nA. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.\n\nQ. How does TB get into cattle herds\nA: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are\n\n- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or\n- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.\n\n\"The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.\"\n\nExtracted from https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/faq_bovine_tb_.pdf. -

No herds in this probe have yet been released from movement controls.\n\nThe current investigation, run jointly by CFIA and the BC government, began after the 1st infected cow was presented for slaughter at a federally-registered facility on [26 Oct 2018]. Post-mortem examination found lesions in that animal's lymph nodes, lungs and liver; the carcass was then condemned and bovine TB was lab-confirmed on [9 Nov 2018].\n\nA federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923.\n\n[Byline: Dave Bedard]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease. Depending on how advanced the lesions are it can be a tough call. The inspectors are to be congratulated. Veterinary inspectors are one of our 1st lines of defense for meat safety. The meat inspectors at the slaughter plant, the front line of detection and prevention will need to be very careful and thorough in their inspections. Inspectors are the front line of preventing diseases such as this from entering the food chain. While we all want cheap, rapid access to quality products, it is very unwise to run a slaughter line so fast the inspectors are not able to do a diligent thorough job, especially when a new strain of disease is prevalent, or any disease needing detecting.\n\nIn November 2018, we were hopeful this was an isolated case, but it takes time to test herds of cattle and do trace-ins and trace-outs (animals moving into or out of a herd) to determine where movements and exposure may have occurred.\n\nNow we know it is not necessarily a single issue but involves more than 1 animal, but hopefully not more than 1 herd. Tracing a new disease back to its origin is one issue, but testing and tracing for a very slow growing disease is quite a longer matter. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBritish Columbia Province, Canada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/264]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nBovine tuberculosis -

No herds in this probe have yet been released from movement controls.\n\nThe current investigation, run jointly by CFIA and the BC government, began after the 1st infected cow was presented for slaughter at a federally-registered facility on [26 Oct 2018]. Post-mortem examination found lesions in that animal's lymph nodes, lungs and liver; the carcass was then condemned and bovine TB was lab-confirmed on [9 Nov 2018].\n\nA federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923.\n\n[Byline: Dave Bedard]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease. Depending on how advanced the lesions are it can be a tough call. The inspectors are to be congratulated. Veterinary inspectors are one of our 1st lines of defense for meat safety. The meat inspectors at the slaughter plant, the front line of detection and prevention will need to be very careful and thorough in their inspections. Inspectors are the front line of preventing diseases such as this from entering the food chain. While we all want cheap, rapid access to quality products, it is very unwise to run a slaughter line so fast the inspectors are not able to do a diligent thorough job, especially when a new strain of disease is prevalent, or any disease needing detecting.\n\nIn November 2018, we were hopeful this was an isolated case, but it takes time to test herds of cattle and do trace-ins and trace-outs (animals moving into or out of a herd) to determine where movements and exposure may have occurred.\n\nNow we know it is not necessarily a single issue but involves more than 1 animal, but hopefully not more than 1 herd. Tracing a new disease back to its origin is one issue, but testing and tracing for a very slow growing disease is quite a longer matter. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBritish Columbia Province, Canada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/264]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nBovine tuberculosis -

No herds in this probe have yet been released from movement controls.\n\nThe current investigation, run jointly by CFIA and the BC government, began after the 1st infected cow was presented for slaughter at a federally-registered facility on [26 Oct 2018]. Post-mortem examination found lesions in that animal's lymph nodes, lungs and liver; the carcass was then condemned and bovine TB was lab-confirmed on [9 Nov 2018].\n\nA federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923.\n\n[Byline: Dave Bedard]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease. Depending on how advanced the lesions are it can be a tough call. The inspectors are to be congratulated. Veterinary inspectors are one of our 1st lines of defense for meat safety. The meat inspectors at the slaughter plant, the front line of detection and prevention will need to be very careful and thorough in their inspections. Inspectors are the front line of preventing diseases such as this from entering the food chain. While we all want cheap, rapid access to quality products, it is very unwise to run a slaughter line so fast the inspectors are not able to do a diligent thorough job, especially when a new strain of disease is prevalent, or any disease needing detecting.\n\nIn November 2018, we were hopeful this was an isolated case, but it takes time to test herds of cattle and do trace-ins and trace-outs (animals moving into or out of a herd) to determine where movements and exposure may have occurred.\n\nNow we know it is not necessarily a single issue but involves more than 1 animal, but hopefully not more than 1 herd. Tracing a new disease back to its origin is one issue, but testing and tracing for a very slow growing disease is quite a longer matter. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBritish Columbia Province, Canada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/264]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nBovine tuberculosis -

No herds in this probe have yet been released from movement controls.\n\nThe current investigation, run jointly by CFIA and the BC government, began after the 1st infected cow was presented for slaughter at a federally-registered facility on [26 Oct 2018]. Post-mortem examination found lesions in that animal's lymph nodes, lungs and liver; the carcass was then condemned and bovine TB was lab-confirmed on [9 Nov 2018].\n\nA federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923.\n\n[Byline: Dave Bedard]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease. Depending on how advanced the lesions are it can be a tough call. The inspectors are to be congratulated. Veterinary inspectors are one of our 1st lines of defense for meat safety. The meat inspectors at the slaughter plant, the front line of detection and prevention will need to be very careful and thorough in their inspections. Inspectors are the front line of preventing diseases such as this from entering the food chain. While we all want cheap, rapid access to quality products, it is very unwise to run a slaughter line so fast the inspectors are not able to do a diligent thorough job, especially when a new strain of disease is prevalent, or any disease needing detecting.\n\nIn November 2018, we were hopeful this was an isolated case, but it takes time to test herds of cattle and do trace-ins and trace-outs (animals moving into or out of a herd) to determine where movements and exposure may have occurred.\n\nNow we know it is not necessarily a single issue but involves more than 1 animal, but hopefully not more than 1 herd. Tracing a new disease back to its origin is one issue, but testing and tracing for a very slow growing disease is quite a longer matter. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBritish Columbia Province, Canada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/264]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (02): (BC) bovine 20181121.6156863\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada: (AB) Mexican strain, 2016 20180502.5780065\n2017\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (02): (AB) Mexican strain 20171119.5452702\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada: (AB) Mexican strain 20171021.5394767\n2016\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (10): (AB) Mexican strain 20161217.4706014\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (09): (AB) Mexican strain 20161127.4657187\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (08): (AB) Mexican strain 20161119.4640117\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (07): (AB) Mexican strain 20161117.4636107\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (06): (AB, SK) singular genome 20161114.4628497\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (05): (AB,SK) extended 20161110.4620082\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (04): (AB) herds quarantined, investigation 20161106.4610944\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (03): (AB) herds quarantined 20161101.4600493\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada (02): (AB) herds quarantined 20161031.4598091\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada: (AB) 20161020.4574397\n2011\n----\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - Canada: (BC) 20110626.1959\n2010\n----\nTuberculosis - Canada: (NU), Inuit 20101008.3659\n2009\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - Canada: (MB) cervid 20091023.3641\n2007\n----\nTuberculosis, bovine - Canada (02): (BC, AB) 20071202.3884\nTuberculosis, bovine - Canada: (BC, AB) 20071111.3664\nTuberculosis, cervids - Canada (MB) (03) 20070918.3094\nTuberculosis, cervids - Canada (MB) (02) 20070915.3068\nTuberculosis, cervids - Canada (MB) 20070914.3060\n.................................................sb/tg/ao/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2019-01-09 00:00:00", "2021-11-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "1923-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-11-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "British Columbia Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Alberta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Saskatchewan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "British Columbia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6170266", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - USA (08): (MI) cervids, alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6170266", "date": "2018-08-03 09:15:25", "main_text": "BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS - UK: (ENGLAND) CANINE, 2016-2017, EPIDEMIOLOGY\n********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 30 Jul 2018\nSource: Transboundary and Emerging Diseases [edited]\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tbed.12969\n\n\nCitation:\nO'Halloran C, Hope JC, Dobromylskyj M, Burr P, McDonald K, Rhodes S, Roberts T et al.

At PME, 3 hounds (3.1 percent) had visible lesions (VL) due to _M. bovis_ infection, later confirmed by culture. Samples from 24 non\u2010VL hounds were cultured, and _M. bovis_ infection was confirmed in a further 3 hounds (11 percent). This study is the 1st investigation and report of an outbreak of _M. bovis_ TB in a canine species.

Test\u2010positive hounds were euthanased and subjected to post-mortem examination (PME). Overall, 164 hounds were tested; 97 (59 percent) responded positively to at least one test. 85 (52 percent) of the dogs responded to _M. bovis_ antigens by IGRA, while only 21 (12.9 percent) had detectable serological responses. At PME, 3 hounds (3.1 percent) had visible lesions (VL) due to _M. bovis_ infection, later confirmed by culture. Samples from 24 non\u2010VL hounds were cultured, and _M. bovis_ infection was confirmed in a further 3 hounds (11 percent). This study is the 1st investigation and report of an outbreak of _M. bovis_ TB in a canine species. We establish that, in principle, diagnostic tests used for identifying infected individuals of other species can effectively be used in the dog.

The said employee has been in Israel since the beginning of September 2017. The information was transferred to the Veterinary Services at the beginning of the week [week of 7-13 Jan 2018] and the entire herd (from the age of 6 months and up) was examined by the comparative tuberculin test. This led to the identification of 19 positive animals, including 17 milking cows, one pregnant heifer and one dry cow [= in nonlactating period], out of a total of 584 tested cattle.\n\nUntill the isolation of the reacting cows, all milk produced in the plant was destroyed. The herd has been put under quarantine.\n\nThe bacterium's species, human or bovine, has not been determined yet; this may take several weeks.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow disease, the positive cows do not pose an immediate risk for further infection. The positive cows will be destroyed at the beginning of the coming week [starting Sun 14 Jan 2018] and an attempt will be made to isolate the bacteria from the lymph nodes. The possible routes of infection from a sick person to animals is by aerosole during coughing or by animals' contact with the patient's sputum or other secretions.\n\nThe herd will enter a routine of tuberculin testing every 60 days and will remain in quarantine until the completion of 2 consecutive negative tests of the entire herd. Weaned calves will be tested at the age of 3 months and will be released for sale provided found negative.\n\nAlthough the dimensions of the infection are unclear, there is no doubt that Uri Koren's early understanding of the significance of the information about the employee's sickness and his initiative to start the chain of alerts have played a central role in preventing further damage to this herd and to the national dairy industry at large.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The described event is a classical case requiring a \"One Health\" approach: the detection of a zoonotic disease, in an animal or a human, deserves to become known to both parties, Public Health and Animal Health agencies alike, as early as possible to allow timely measures undertaken on both sides as deems necessary.

He was then hospitalized, TB suspected on [Tue 2 Jan 2018], confirmed next day. This became known to the farm's veterinary practitioner the same day [Wed 3 Jan 2018] and the information was immediately notified, through the main office of his employer (\"Hachaklait\" Veterinary Services, Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary Services and Livestock Insurance in Israel, catering for about 90 percent of the country's dairy farms) by e-mail to the State veterinary services.

The Department of Animal Products Control will publish a monitoring procedure in the coming month.\n\n\"4.

The said employee has been in Israel since the beginning of September 2017. The information was transferred to the Veterinary Services at the beginning of the week [week of 7-13 Jan 2018] and the entire herd (from the age of 6 months and up) was examined by the comparative tuberculin test. This led to the identification of 19 positive animals, including 17 milking cows, one pregnant heifer and one dry cow [= in nonlactating period], out of a total of 584 tested cattle.\n\nUntill the isolation of the reacting cows, all milk produced in the plant was destroyed. The herd has been put under quarantine.\n\nThe bacterium's species, human or bovine, has not been determined yet; this may take several weeks.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow disease, the positive cows do not pose an immediate risk for further infection. The positive cows will be destroyed at the beginning of the coming week [starting Sun 14 Jan 2018] and an attempt will be made to isolate the bacteria from the lymph nodes. The possible routes of infection from a sick person to animals is by aerosole during coughing or by animals' contact with the patient's sputum or other secretions.\n\nThe herd will enter a routine of tuberculin testing every 60 days and will remain in quarantine until the completion of 2 consecutive negative tests of the entire herd. Weaned calves will be tested at the age of 3 months and will be released for sale provided found negative.\n\nAlthough the dimensions of the infection are unclear, there is no doubt that Uri Koren's early understanding of the significance of the information about the employee's sickness and his initiative to start the chain of alerts have played a central role in preventing further damage to this herd and to the national dairy industry at large.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The described event is a classical case requiring a \"One Health\" approach: the detection of a zoonotic disease, in an animal or a human, deserves to become known to both parties, Public Health and Animal Health agencies alike, as early as possible to allow timely measures undertaken on both sides as deems necessary.

The said employee has been in Israel since the beginning of September 2017. The information was transferred to the Veterinary Services at the beginning of the week [week of 7-13 Jan 2018] and the entire herd (from the age of 6 months and up) was examined by the comparative tuberculin test. This led to the identification of 19 positive animals, including 17 milking cows, one pregnant heifer and one dry cow [= in nonlactating period], out of a total of 584 tested cattle.\n\nUntill the isolation of the reacting cows, all milk produced in the plant was destroyed. The herd has been put under quarantine.\n\nThe bacterium's species, human or bovine, has not been determined yet; this may take several weeks.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow disease, the positive cows do not pose an immediate risk for further infection. The positive cows will be destroyed at the beginning of the coming week [starting Sun 14 Jan 2018] and an attempt will be made to isolate the bacteria from the lymph nodes. The possible routes of infection from a sick person to animals is by aerosole during coughing or by animals' contact with the patient's sputum or other secretions.\n\nThe herd will enter a routine of tuberculin testing every 60 days and will remain in quarantine until the completion of 2 consecutive negative tests of the entire herd. Weaned calves will be tested at the age of 3 months and will be released for sale provided found negative.\n\nAlthough the dimensions of the infection are unclear, there is no doubt that Uri Koren's early understanding of the significance of the information about the employee's sickness and his initiative to start the chain of alerts have played a central role in preventing further damage to this herd and to the national dairy industry at large.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The described event is a classical case requiring a \"One Health\" approach: the detection of a zoonotic disease, in an animal or a human, deserves to become known to both parties, Public Health and Animal Health agencies alike, as early as possible to allow timely measures undertaken on both sides as deems necessary. According to additional information we received from a reliable source, the patient felt unwell during the last 2 weeks of Dec 2017, initially suspecting flu; eventually he could not continue working: his last working day was [Thu 28 Dec 2017]. He was then hospitalized, TB suspected on [Tue 2 Jan 2018], confirmed next day. This became known to the farm's veterinary practitioner the same day [Wed 3 Jan 2018] and the information was immediately notified, through the main office of his employer (\"Hachaklait\" Veterinary Services, Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary Services and Livestock Insurance in Israel, catering for about 90 percent of the country's dairy farms) by e-mail to the State veterinary services.

Prior to this decision, the tuberculin tests were required to be performed in each farm once in 5 years. The said announcement included, among others, the following articles 3-5:\n\n\"3. Monitoring and surveillance of TB disease is to be moved from the field to the handling by slaughterhouses. The Department of Animal Products Control will publish a monitoring procedure in the coming month.\n\n\"4. The laboratory of bacteriology at the Kimron Veterinary Institute will examine the introduction of modern bTB testing methods.\n\n\"5.

According to additional information we received from a reliable source, the patient felt unwell during the last 2 weeks of Dec 2017, initially suspecting flu; eventually he could not continue working: his last working day was [Thu 28 Dec 2017]. He was then hospitalized, TB suspected on [Tue 2 Jan 2018], confirmed next day. This became known to the farm's veterinary practitioner the same day [Wed 3 Jan 2018] and the information was immediately notified, through the main office of his employer (\"Hachaklait\" Veterinary Services, Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary Services and Livestock Insurance in Israel, catering for about 90 percent of the country's dairy farms) by e-mail to the State veterinary services. The flow of information between the State's Public Health and Animal Health agencies is yet to be visited.\n\nEmployees of food-producing enterprises, in Israel and elsewhere, are traditionally required by law to undergo periodical tests for infectious disease agents, in particular for tuberculosis.\n\nOn 8 Mar 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture published \"Draft business licensing regulations for dairy cattle farming and sheep barns\" for the public's comments. Article 25 (5) of the drafted regulations said, \"A person shall not milk an animal if that person has a contagious disease, a bowel disease, a skin disease or open pustular cuts.\" The approval of the said regulations and their official publication and application afield has not yet been realized.\n\nOn 26 Feb 2015, Israel's Veterinary Services announced the discontinuation of periodic tuberculin testing in cattle, in effect as of 1 Mar 2015. (Hebrew, at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/VetBasade/Pirsumim/2015/Documents/mivhan__mrt.pdf). Prior to this decision, the tuberculin tests were required to be performed in each farm once in 5 years. The said announcement included, among others, the following articles 3-5:\n\n\"3. Monitoring and surveillance of TB disease is to be moved from the field to the handling by slaughterhouses. The Department of Animal Products Control will publish a monitoring procedure in the coming month.\n\n\"4. The laboratory of bacteriology at the Kimron Veterinary Institute will examine the introduction of modern bTB testing methods.\n\n\"5. The State Veterinary Services will perform risk analysis at least once every 2 years to examine the bTB epidemiological picture and ways of controlling the disease. They will update the Ministry of Health in case any changes are implemented\".\n\nBovine tuberculosis has been eradicated in Israel in 1973, not a single case detected on a dairy farm since. The last case in grazing beef cattle was recorded in 1999. The 1st risk analysis of the bTB situation should have taken place, according to the 2015 decision, the latest 2 year after 1 Mar 2015, namely 10 months ago. In case performed, its summary and conclusions will be useful.\n\nNotably, last week [week of Sun 31 Dec 2017], the Israeli Government published the following decision, included within the Government document \"2019 budget\" (page 8 in https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/sedergov080118/he/seg080118.pdf):\n\n\"To impose on the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development the establishment of an inter-ministerial team to examine the possibility of selling [!! - Mod.AS] some of the research and laboratory services of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, and accordingly to recommend the outline of the sale. The team will consult \"with advice and legislation\" regarding all aspects related to the legislative powers of the Institute. The composition of the team will be determined in coordination with the Deputy Attorney General (administrative-public law)\" .\n\nThe 2015 expectations from the Kimron Institute's Dep of bacteriology to modernize its bTB techniques (whatever this may mean) are to be weighed against the above government decision.\n\nThe Kimron Veterinary Institute, established 1957, has been instrumental in achieving Israel's satisfactory animal health status in spite of the concerning health situation prevailing in the region, including serious zoonotic diseases (eg RVF). It includes 2 OIE reference laboratories (Brucellosis and rabies).\n\nA map of (HaDarom, Israel): http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29822. - Mod.AS]\nSee Also\nBovine tuberculosis - Israel: (HD) bovine, OIE 20180112.5555373\n2017\n----\nMycobacterium bovis: animal-to-human transmission 20171014.538083\nBovine tuberculosis - Iraq: (WA) international impact 20170730.5214302\n2008\n----\nTuberculosis, bovine - Kuwait (03): Jul-Dec 2007 20080702.2016\nTuberculosis, bovine - Kuwait (02) 20080515.1627\nTuberculosis, bovine - Kuwait 20080504.1526\n2005\n----\nTuberculosis - Iraq (Missan) 20050613.1652\n.................................................arn/ec/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "rabies", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2007-01-13 20:18:00", "2018-01-14 00:00:00", "2017-12-16 00:00:00", "2018-01-02 00:00:00", "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "2008-03-08 00:00:00", "2015-02-26 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1973-03-16 00:00:00", "1999-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1957-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Kuwait", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Uganda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "HaDarom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "kuwait", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5540747", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - USA: (NE) investigation proceeds", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5540747", "date": "2017-11-10 16:49:32", "main_text": "TUBERCULOSIS, ELEPHANT - USA (02): (MISSOURI)\n*********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 9 Nov 21 2017\nSource: St. Louis Business Journal [edited]\nhttps://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2017/11/09/saint-louis-zoo-elephant-tests-positive-for.html\n\n\nA 46-year-old Asian elephant at the Saint Louis Zoo, has tested positive for tuberculosis, according to Zoo officials.\n\nVeterinarians and the elephant care team at the Zoo are preparing to start the elephant on an appropriate treatment regimen, they said.\n\nThe Saint Louis Zoo said it has informed the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Missouri Department of Agriculture and other local agencies about the elephant's test results.

The cattle were traced to a herd in Harding County, northwest of Rapid City. Herd testing and laboratory confirmation has revealed additional infected animals.\n\n\"We are working closely with the affected herd owner and USDA officials and will be working with area veterinarians and other herd owners to evaluate the extent of the disease,\" Oedekoven said in a release.\n\nOedekoven said adjacent herds will be tested and that bovine TB is not a food safety threat, thanks to milk pasteurization and meat inspection programs.\n\nBovine TB is a respiratory disease. Infected animals may be capable of transmitting an infection to other animals even if they appear healthy. The United States has nearly eliminated bovine TB due to a cooperative eradication campaign.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\nTB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.\n\nTB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough.

Herd testing and laboratory confirmation has revealed additional infected animals.\n\n\"We are working closely with the affected herd owner and USDA officials and will be working with area veterinarians and other herd owners to evaluate the extent of the disease,\" Oedekoven said in a release.\n\nOedekoven said adjacent herds will be tested and that bovine TB is not a food safety threat, thanks to milk pasteurization and meat inspection programs.\n\nBovine TB is a respiratory disease. Infected animals may be capable of transmitting an infection to other animals even if they appear healthy. The United States has nearly eliminated bovine TB due to a cooperative eradication campaign.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\nTB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.\n\nTB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.\"\n\nThere is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from the APHIS Bovine Tuberculosis Disease Information webpage https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/cattle-disease-information/sa_tuberculosis/ and http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/faq_bovine_tb_.pdf. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/243.]\nSee Also\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (MI) 20170123.4786644\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (08): (IN) corr 20170102.4737527\n2016\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (08): (IN) 20161228.4729068\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (07): (MI) 20161210.4688768\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (05): (MI) new county affected 20161101.4600409\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): (MI) 20160519.4233252\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (MI) 20160108.3919034\n2015\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): (MI) bovine 20150725.3534951\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (02): (MI) dairy cows 20150426.3323167\n2014\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (04): (MI) 20140413.2400796\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (MI) cervids 20140324.2352510\n2013\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): (MI) bovine 20130326.1603312\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (MI), bovine 20130105.1482604\n2012\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (02): (MI) bovine 20120629.1184446\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (MI) cervid 20120218.1045847\n2011\n----\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (02): (MI) 20110416.1196\nBovine tuberculosis, cervid - USA: (MI) 20110322.0895\n2010\n----\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (07): (MI) 20100909.3246\nBovine tuberculosis, cervid - USA: (MI) 20100418.1265\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (02): (MI) 20100325.0948\n.................................................sb/tg/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2017-02-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Harding County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "http://healthmap.org/promed/p/243", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Dakota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rapid City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4786644", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - USA: (MI)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4786644", "date": "2016-11-20 11:21:15", "main_text": "TUBERCULOSIS - USA: (OKLAHOMA) HIGH SCHOOL\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Thu 17 Nov 2016\nSource: Newson6 [edited]\nhttp://m.newson6.com/story.aspx?story=33734827&catId=112042\n\n\nA 2nd tuberculosis case has been confirmed at Jenks High School [Tulsa, Oklahoma].\n\nIn an email to Jenks school parents on Thursday morning [17 Nov 2016], the district says the student is no longer attending school and is receiving treatment.

TB exists in 2 forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and clinically active infection (TB disease). Those with recent exposure to a person with contagious TB (e.g., pulmonary or laryngeal TB with positive sputum smear) should be evaluated immediately for LTBI because of the risk for progression to TB disease. Testing for LTBI is done by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or a blood test known as an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). If the TST or IGRA result is positive, and there is no evidence of TB disease, they should be treated for LTBI. Those who initially have negative results should be retested in 8-10 weeks after exposure has ended. Medical evaluations for TB disease include a TST or an IGRA, a chest x-ray and physical examination.\n\nTST is the preferred method for testing children under the age of 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm) because of limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf). TST will detect _M. tuberculosis_ infection as well as prior exposure to BCG vaccine or non-tuberculous mycobacteria. IGRAs, however, are unaffected by BCG and most non-tuberculous, environmental mycobacteria. IGRAs should be used if there is a question of false positive reaction to TST in the exposed Jenks high school students.\n\nTB in children, either as LTBI or as TB disease, is an indication of recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, usually from an adult with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis, who was in close contact with the children, for example, at school, or in the home. Case finding should identify these sources. In addition, in the U.S., TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who have acquired the infection in countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk from _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis Rep 2008, 10(6): 444-6 and Dankner WM, Davis CE: _Mycobacterium bovis_ as a significant cause of tuberculosis in children residing along the United States-Mexico border in the Baja California region. Pediatrics. 2000; 105(6): E79; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835092).\n\n_M. bovis_ is resistant to the anti-TB drug pyrazinamide (PZA), an essential component of the initial 8-week phase of the 6-month drug treatment regimen for active TB disease. If the initial phase of treatment does not include PZA, treatment must be continued for a total of 9 months, rather than 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm).\n\nTulsa, with a metropolitan area population of about one million residents, is located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma). The city is the county seat of Tulsa County, the most densely populated county in Oklahoma. Jenks, the location of Jenks High School, is a suburb of Tulsa in Tulsa County.

TB exists in 2 forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and clinically active infection (TB disease). Those with recent exposure to a person with contagious TB (e.g., pulmonary or laryngeal TB with positive sputum smear) should be evaluated immediately for LTBI because of the risk for progression to TB disease. Testing for LTBI is done by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or a blood test known as an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). If the TST or IGRA result is positive, and there is no evidence of TB disease, they should be treated for LTBI. Those who initially have negative results should be retested in 8-10 weeks after exposure has ended. Medical evaluations for TB disease include a TST or an IGRA, a chest x-ray and physical examination.\n\nTST is the preferred method for testing children under the age of 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm) because of limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf). TST will detect _M. tuberculosis_ infection as well as prior exposure to BCG vaccine or non-tuberculous mycobacteria. IGRAs, however, are unaffected by BCG and most non-tuberculous, environmental mycobacteria. IGRAs should be used if there is a question of false positive reaction to TST in the exposed Jenks high school students.\n\nTB in children, either as LTBI or as TB disease, is an indication of recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, usually from an adult with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis, who was in close contact with the children, for example, at school, or in the home. Case finding should identify these sources. In addition, in the U.S., TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who have acquired the infection in countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk from _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen.

TB exists in 2 forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and clinically active infection (TB disease). Those with recent exposure to a person with contagious TB (e.g., pulmonary or laryngeal TB with positive sputum smear) should be evaluated immediately for LTBI because of the risk for progression to TB disease. Testing for LTBI is done by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or a blood test known as an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). If the TST or IGRA result is positive, and there is no evidence of TB disease, they should be treated for LTBI. Those who initially have negative results should be retested in 8-10 weeks after exposure has ended. Medical evaluations for TB disease include a TST or an IGRA, a chest x-ray and physical examination.\n\nTST is the preferred method for testing children under the age of 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm) because of limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf). TST will detect _M. tuberculosis_ infection as well as prior exposure to BCG vaccine or non-tuberculous mycobacteria. IGRAs, however, are unaffected by BCG and most non-tuberculous, environmental mycobacteria. IGRAs should be used if there is a question of false positive reaction to TST in the exposed Jenks high school students.\n\nTB in children, either as LTBI or as TB disease, is an indication of recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, usually from an adult with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis, who was in close contact with the children, for example, at school, or in the home. Case finding should identify these sources. In addition, in the U.S., TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who have acquired the infection in countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk from _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen.

This comes after a high school student was diagnosed with the disease earlier this month [November 2016].\n\nSchool officials say several students did have a positive [tuberculin] skin test, but state health officials say they believe they were likely false positives.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Mon 7 Nov 2016.\nSource: Newson6 [edited]\nhttp://m.newson6.com/story/33649536/free-tb-tests-offered-after-jenks-student-diagnosed-with-tuberculosis\n\n\nJenks High School and the Tulsa Health Department are planning free tuberculosis testing for some students who they think may have come in contact with a student diagnosed with TB.\n\nThe Health Department confirmed with the district Monday [7 Nov 2016] morning that one high school student tested positive. The high school student has missed the last 3 weeks of class, and the health department says recovery can take at least 6 months.\n\nRob Loeber with Jenks High School said that since learning about the student with tuberculosis, the school has been in touch with the teen's family. \"We know that the student is okay and hopefully can return to school as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department says the risk of tuberculosis spreading to anyone at the school is \"extremely low,\" but the infection is serious. Tulsa City-County Health Department [THD] Donna Durant-Macon with THD said: \"Left untreated, it can lead to death.\"\n\nDurant-Macon manages the tuberculosis program with the health department and said anyone who has had close, repeated contact with the affected student needs to take their health seriously. Students who rode the bus or went to class with the affected student are being contacted by the Tulsa Health Department and are encouraged to get tested for TB. \"If the test is positive, then we will offer chest X-rays here at the Tulsa Health Department, and there's no charge for those,\" Duran-Macon said.\n\nThe health department said that so far this year [2016], there have been 61 cases of tuberculosis statewide. Last year [2015], there were 67 cases, 16 in Tulsa County. But Durant-Macon said that it might be more common than people realize. \"I think statistically, about 1/3rd of the population is infected with the dormant infection,\" she said. She added that in some cases, active tuberculosis can take 18 to 24 months to recover from. \"We wish the student well; we wish the family well,\" Loeber said. \"I know it's a trying thing for kids and families to go through.\"\n\nFree testing is available Tuesday [8 Nov 2016] at the high school for students who the health department reached out to.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Morgan Mueller for submission of the news report of an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in an Oklahoma high school.\n\nTB is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. TB exists in 2 forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and clinically active infection (TB disease). Those with recent exposure to a person with contagious TB (e.g., pulmonary or laryngeal TB with positive sputum smear) should be evaluated immediately for LTBI because of the risk for progression to TB disease. Testing for LTBI is done by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or a blood test known as an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). If the TST or IGRA result is positive, and there is no evidence of TB disease, they should be treated for LTBI. Those who initially have negative results should be retested in 8-10 weeks after exposure has ended. Medical evaluations for TB disease include a TST or an IGRA, a chest x-ray and physical examination.\n\nTST is the preferred method for testing children under the age of 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm) because of limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf). TST will detect _M. tuberculosis_ infection as well as prior exposure to BCG vaccine or non-tuberculous mycobacteria. IGRAs, however, are unaffected by BCG and most non-tuberculous, environmental mycobacteria. IGRAs should be used if there is a question of false positive reaction to TST in the exposed Jenks high school students.\n\nTB in children, either as LTBI or as TB disease, is an indication of recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_, usually from an adult with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis, who was in close contact with the children, for example, at school, or in the home. Case finding should identify these sources. In addition, in the U.S., TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who have acquired the infection in countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk from _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis Rep 2008, 10(6): 444-6 and Dankner WM, Davis CE: _Mycobacterium bovis_ as a significant cause of tuberculosis in children residing along the United States-Mexico border in the Baja California region. Pediatrics. 2000; 105(6): E79; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835092).\n\n_M. bovis_ is resistant to the anti-TB drug pyrazinamide (PZA), an essential component of the initial 8-week phase of the 6-month drug treatment regimen for active TB disease. If the initial phase of treatment does not include PZA, treatment must be continued for a total of 9 months, rather than 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm).\n\nTulsa, with a metropolitan area population of about one million residents, is located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Oklahoma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma). The city is the county seat of Tulsa County, the most densely populated county in Oklahoma. Jenks, the location of Jenks High School, is a suburb of Tulsa in Tulsa County. As of the 2010 census, the Jenks population was 16 924.

After the steer was removed, it tested positive for bovine TB, the statement said.\n\nState agriculture officials identified the farm in Huron County that sent the steer to slaughter, along with 2 prior farms in Presque Isle County where the animal had been kept. Each farm will be tested to ensure the disease is not present, the statement said. A 3-mi [approx 4.8 km] surveillance area around the Huron County farm has been established and all farms within that zone will have 6 months to complete bovine tuberculosis testing.\n\nThere will be a meeting to discuss the finding of bovine TB and the surveillance area at 7 pm, on 14 Nov [2016] at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites, 55 Rapson Lane West in Bad Axe.\n\n\"Cattle properly identified with (radio frequency identification) can be traced in minutes,\" Dr. Rick Smith, assistant state veterinarian said in a statement. \"Not only can we find the most recent owner, we can successfully track where the animal has moved, allowing us to stamp out disease before it spreads.\"\n\nThe name of the farm that the steer came from and city it was located in was not released under Public Act 466 that bars making that information public, according to Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development. \"This did not go into the food chain,\" Holton said of the steer. \"This shows that what is supposed to be happening did happen to make sure that consumer public health, food safety is protected.\"\n\nBovine TB primarily affects cattle, but can be spread between other mammals, including humans. The [bacterial pathogen] primarily affects the respiratory system of infected animals, but can spread to other parts of the body.

Beijing strains have also been found to exhibit increased virulence in animal models, being better able to withstand tuberculosis treatment, even in the absence of drug resistance (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/201/4/553.full). - Mod.ML\n\nMaps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142.]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis - India (03): (SK) intro. of GeneXpert system, high MDR rates 20160716.4350079\nTuberculosis - India (02): (PB) MDR, more labs, more cases anticipated 20160202.3987571\n2015\n----\nTuberculosis - India (05): MDR, children 20151119.3803835\nTuberculosis - India (04): (MH) nosocomial, MDR 20151014.3714117\nTuberculosis - India: (PB) MDR 20150106.3074389\n2014\n----\nTuberculosis - India (03): MDR, 2013 20141129.2998315\nTuberculosis - India (02): (MH) MDR 20140328.2364314\nTuberculosis - India: (MH) MDR 20140202.2249690\n2013\n----\nTuberculosis - India (03): (MH) MDR 20131121.2066039\nTuberculosis - India (02): MDR 20130510.1703033\n2012\n----\nTuberculosis, MDR - India: (MH) 20120426.1114435\n2008\n----\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - USA ex India 20080103.0019\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2002-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mumbai", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bombay", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4350079", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Tuberculosis - India (03): (SK) intro. of GeneXpert system, high MDR rates", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4350079", "date": "2016-05-02 19:24:10", "main_text": "BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS - NEW ZEALAND: CATTLE, DEER, POSSUMS\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 2 May 2016\nSource: NZ Herald [edited]\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=11632206\n\n\nA ferret survey is being undertaken in the Mt Cargill area, near Dunedin, after last year's [2015] bovine Tb outbreak.\n\nFour herds of cattle and deer were identified as infected with Tb.

Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in a process that the bacteria will not survive.\n\nAlso, most places have a meat inspection process to prevent diseased or suspect diseased animals from entering the human food chain.\n\nUsing possums and ferrets to understand disease dissemination seems reasonable, but the deer component seems a more complicated factor. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164.]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - New Zealand 20151205.3843019\nBovine tuberculosis, alpaca - Norway (02): ex Canada, comment 20150831.3614443\nBovine tuberculosis, alpaca - Norway: ex Canada, RFI 20150829.3610821\nBovine tuberculosis - Belgium (02): (LI) update 20150819.3587763\nBovine tuberculosis - Belgium: (LI) 20150808.3566504\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): (MI) bovine 20150725.3534951\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (02): (MI) dairy cows 20150426.3323167\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: (England) bovine 20150127.3124201\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (TX) dairy cattle 20150115.3093307\n2014\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - Fiji: (CE) 20141114.2954055\nBovine tuberculosis - Ireland: call for cervid control 20141104.2928051\nBovine tuberculosis - France: (SM) 20140728.2641321\nBovine tuberculosis - UK (02): bovine, spread, research 20140705.2589984\nBovine tuberculosis, alpaca - Norway: ex UK, susp, RFI 20140530.2508847\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (04): (MI) 20140413.2400796\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: bovine spread, feline 20140410.2395905\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): tuberculin shortage 20140330.2367001\n.................................................sb/tg/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-05-02 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-05-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Norway", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4197585", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - USA (02): (IN, PA)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4197585", "date": "2016-03-03 10:28:40", "main_text": "TUBERCULOSIS, MDR - PAPUA NEW GUINEA: (WESTERN PROVINCE)\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 29 Feb 2016\nSource: EMTV News [edited]\nhttp://www.emtv.com.pg/article.aspx?slug=TB-Cases-Increase&subcategory=Top-Stories\n\n\nExtra-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis have been detected in Daru, Western Province [Papua New Guinea].

Primary drug resistance indicates a need for better TB control to interrupt transmission, whereas acquired drug resistance indicates a need for better patient management to prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/14673.]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nTuberculosis, MDR - Papua New Guinea 20151120.3806545\n2013\n----\nTuberculosis - Australia (02): (QL) ex Papua New Guinea, XDR, fatal, RFI 20130524.1735824\nTuberculosis - Australia: (QL) ex Papua New Guinea, XDR, fatal 20130318.1591289\n2012\n----\nTuberculosis - Australia: (QL) ex Papua New Guinea 20121020.1355085\n2008\n----\nTuberculosis, MDR, XDR - Worldwide: WHO 20080228.0813\nTuberculosis, MDR - Papua New Guinea 20080206.0478\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-02-29 00:00:00", "2016-01-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "1975-03-16 00:00:00", "1967-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Queensland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Papua New Guinea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Guinea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Daru", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Western Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Commonwealth", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Melanesia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "XDR", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Daru , Western Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3987571", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Tuberculosis - India (02): (PB) MDR, more labs, more cases anticipated", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3987571", "date": "2015-12-05 22:51:31", "main_text": "BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS - NEW ZEALAND\n*********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 5 Dec 2015\nSource: Otago Daily Times [edited]\nhttp://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/365857/bovine-tb-found-three-mt-cargill-herds\n\n\nAn investigation is under way to find the cause of a \"disappointing\" bovine TB outbreak in 3 herds at Mt Cargill, on the outskirts of Dunedin.\n\nEarlier [in 2015], the number of infected cattle herds in Otago was officially zero, although there were 2 infected deer herds in Central Otago.\n\nYesterday [4 Dec 2015], Ospri South Island relationships manager Danny Templeman said all possible sources of the infectious disease were being explored and measures introduced to reduce the risk to cattle and deer herds in the area.\n\nSlaughter and routine TB testing identified the 3 herds, which were understood to comprise both cattle and deer.\n\nPossums and ferrets were the main carriers of the disease.\n\nAs well as investigating the source of the infection, Ospri was taking \"immediate action\" to manage and control the disease on the properties, Mr Templeman said.\n\nAn initial possum control operation was due to begin next week and the public were asked to heed warning signs if they were in the area. Possum carcasses would be recovered and autopsies performed to help determine the source of the disease. It was important to get the possum surveillance completed quickly to provide information to herd owners in the area.\n\nMr Templeman would not comment on the specific details of the herds. Further information on the herds was being gathered and on the disease status of wildlife surrounding the properties.\n\nSince the disease hit high levels in the 1990s, a huge effort has been put into controlling it, with about USD 1.2 billion spent over the past 15 years.\n\nIn 1998, there were 306 infected herds in Otago and 1700 nationally. The national infected herds figure earlier [in 2015] was 41.\n\nMr Templeman said the potential for TB infection was not unexpected, although the latest confirmation of the disease was \"certainly disappointing.\".\n\nOspri's TBfree programme would be doing its best to control the outbreak and make sure infected herd numbers were reduced. It was probably a good reminder the disease was still present and everyone needed to remain vigilant, he said.\n\nTBfree Otago committee chairman Ross Wilson, of Omakau, said an infected herd placed stress on the owner, with financial costs and disruptions to farm-management routines, often for a year or more while the disease was eliminated from the herd.\n\n\"It is never pleasant to find TB in your herd and this case is a reminder that the disease still poses a threat to farmed cattle and deer in the region,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\nThere was always the likelihood that it could be found and it was disappointing that it was in \"one little area,\" he said.\n\nWhere the risk of TB infection was particularly high, movement-control areas were in place to ensure certain conditions, such as pre-movement testing, were met before stock is moved.\n\nThe latest infected herds were found just outside a movement-control area, he said.\n\n[Byline: Sally Rae]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Indeed it is always sad for the owner, and even for those officials charged with regulating the disease.\n\nThe possum in New Zealand is a resident carrier of the disease, as is the badger in the UK.\n\nBovine tuberculosis (TB) is a slow insidious disease that can have a nasty grip on a herd before it is ever located.\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\nTB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.\n\nTB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.\n\nAlthough the disease (TB) is transmissible from animals to humans, the risk of infection is likely small. The responsible bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted by close contact with the animals. Practically speaking, the producer and family, the veterinarian, the cattle dealers and slaughterhouse workers are most at risk. A consumer can become infected just by drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in a process that the bacteria will not survive.\n\nAlso most places have a meat inspection process to prevent diseased or suspect diseased animals from entering the human food chain.\n\nThe investigation will likely involve tracing where animals have come from to be in the herd, or where animals may have gone if any have been sold, as well as testing the herd. This investigation likely has a wildlife component to it as well. Testing of the possums and the deer will also be involved. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164.]\nSee Also\nBovine tuberculosis, alpaca - Norway (02): ex Canada, comment 20150831.3614443\nBovine tuberculosis, alpaca - Norway: ex Canada, RFI 20150829.3610821\nBovine tuberculosis - Belgium (02): (LI) update 20150819.3587763\nBovine tuberculosis - Belgium: (LI) 20150808.3566504\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): (MI) bovine 20150725.3534951\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (02): (MI) dairy cows 20150426.3323167\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: (England) bovine 20150127.3124201\nBovine tuberculosis - USA: (TX) dairy cattle 20150115.3093307\n2014\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - Fiji: (CE) 20141114.2954055\nBovine tuberculosis - Ireland: call for cervid control 20141104.2928051\nBovine tuberculosis - France: (SM) 20140728.2641321\nBovine tuberculosis - UK (02): bovine, spread, research 20140705.2589984\nBovine tuberculosis, alpaca - Norway: ex UK, susp, RFI 20140530.2508847\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (04): (MI) 20140413.2400796\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: bovine spread, feline 20140410.2395905\nBovine tuberculosis - USA (03): tuberculin shortage 20140330.2367001\nAnd others in the archives.\n.................................................sb/tg/pg/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1700-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2041-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Norway", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Otago", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3952031", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Tuberculosis - India: (MH) XDR, more cases, more labs", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3952031", "date": "2015-12-05 22:51:31", "main_text": "BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS - NEW ZEALAND\n*********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 5 Dec 2015\nSource: Otago Daily Times [edited]\nhttp://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/365857/bovine-tb-found-three-mt-cargill-herds\n\n\nAn investigation is under way to find the cause of a \"disappointing\" bovine TB outbreak in 3 herds at Mt Cargill, on the outskirts of Dunedin.\n\nEarlier [in 2015], the number of infected cattle herds in Otago was officially zero, although there were 2 infected deer herds in Central Otago.\n\nYesterday [4 Dec 2015], Ospri South Island relationships manager Danny Templeman said all possible sources of the infectious disease were being explored and measures introduced to reduce the risk to cattle and deer herds in the area.\n\nSlaughter and routine TB testing identified the 3 herds, which were understood to comprise both cattle and deer.\n\nPossums and ferrets were the main carriers of the disease.\n\nAs well as investigating the source of the infection, Ospri was taking \"immediate action\" to manage and control the disease on the properties, Mr Templeman said.\n\nAn initial possum control operation was due to begin next week and the public were asked to heed warning signs if they were in the area.

Possum carcasses would be recovered and autopsies performed to help determine the source of the disease. It was important to get the possum surveillance completed quickly to provide information to herd owners in the area.\n\nMr Templeman would not comment on the specific details of the herds. Further information on the herds was being gathered and on the disease status of wildlife surrounding the properties.\n\nSince the disease hit high levels in the 1990s, a huge effort has been put into controlling it, with about USD 1.2 billion spent over the past 15 years.\n\nIn 1998, there were 306 infected herds in Otago and 1700 nationally. The national infected herds figure earlier [in 2015] was 41.\n\nMr Templeman said the potential for TB infection was not unexpected, although the latest confirmation of the disease was \"certainly disappointing.\".\n\nOspri's TBfree programme would be doing its best to control the outbreak and make sure infected herd numbers were reduced. It was probably a good reminder the disease was still present and everyone needed to remain vigilant, he said.\n\nTBfree Otago committee chairman Ross Wilson, of Omakau, said an infected herd placed stress on the owner, with financial costs and disruptions to farm-management routines, often for a year or more while the disease was eliminated from the herd.\n\n\"It is never pleasant to find TB in your herd and this case is a reminder that the disease still poses a threat to farmed cattle and deer in the region,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\nThere was always the likelihood that it could be found and it was disappointing that it was in \"one little area,\" he said.\n\nWhere the risk of TB infection was particularly high, movement-control areas were in place to ensure certain conditions, such as pre-movement testing, were met before stock is moved.\n\nThe latest infected herds were found just outside a movement-control area, he said.\n\n[Byline: Sally Rae]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Indeed it is always sad for the owner, and even for those officials charged with regulating the disease.\n\nThe possum in New Zealand is a resident carrier of the disease, as is the badger in the UK.\n\nBovine tuberculosis (TB) is a slow insidious disease that can have a nasty grip on a herd before it is ever located.\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\nTB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.\n\nTB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.\n\nAlthough the disease (TB) is transmissible from animals to humans, the risk of infection is likely small. The responsible bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted by close contact with the animals. Practically speaking, the producer and family, the veterinarian, the cattle dealers and slaughterhouse workers are most at risk. A consumer can become infected just by drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in a process that the bacteria will not survive.\n\nAlso most places have a meat inspection process to prevent diseased or suspect diseased animals from entering the human food chain.\n\nThe investigation will likely involve tracing where animals have come from to be in the herd, or where animals may have gone if any have been sold, as well as testing the herd.

Possum carcasses would be recovered and autopsies performed to help determine the source of the disease. It was important to get the possum surveillance completed quickly to provide information to herd owners in the area.\n\nMr Templeman would not comment on the specific details of the herds. Further information on the herds was being gathered and on the disease status of wildlife surrounding the properties.\n\nSince the disease hit high levels in the 1990s, a huge effort has been put into controlling it, with about USD 1.2 billion spent over the past 15 years.\n\nIn 1998, there were 306 infected herds in Otago and 1700 nationally. The national infected herds figure earlier [in 2015] was 41.\n\nMr Templeman said the potential for TB infection was not unexpected, although the latest confirmation of the disease was \"certainly disappointing.\".\n\nOspri's TBfree programme would be doing its best to control the outbreak and make sure infected herd numbers were reduced. It was probably a good reminder the disease was still present and everyone needed to remain vigilant, he said.\n\nTBfree Otago committee chairman Ross Wilson, of Omakau, said an infected herd placed stress on the owner, with financial costs and disruptions to farm-management routines, often for a year or more while the disease was eliminated from the herd.\n\n\"It is never pleasant to find TB in your herd and this case is a reminder that the disease still poses a threat to farmed cattle and deer in the region,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\nThere was always the likelihood that it could be found and it was disappointing that it was in \"one little area,\" he said.\n\nWhere the risk of TB infection was particularly high, movement-control areas were in place to ensure certain conditions, such as pre-movement testing, were met before stock is moved.\n\nThe latest infected herds were found just outside a movement-control area, he said.\n\n[Byline: Sally Rae]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Indeed it is always sad for the owner, and even for those officials charged with regulating the disease.\n\nThe possum in New Zealand is a resident carrier of the disease, as is the badger in the UK.\n\nBovine tuberculosis (TB) is a slow insidious disease that can have a nasty grip on a herd before it is ever located.\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.\n\nTB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.\n\nTB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.\n\nAlthough the disease (TB) is transmissible from animals to humans, the risk of infection is likely small. The responsible bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted by close contact with the animals. Practically speaking, the producer and family, the veterinarian, the cattle dealers and slaughterhouse workers are most at risk. A consumer can become infected just by drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in a process that the bacteria will not survive.\n\nAlso most places have a meat inspection process to prevent diseased or suspect diseased animals from entering the human food chain.\n\nThe investigation will likely involve tracing where animals have come from to be in the herd, or where animals may have gone if any have been sold, as well as testing the herd.

About 360 000 Europeans developed TB in 2013 but, even with an annual 6-percent decline, Europe will not be TB-free until the next century.\n\nThere has been a sustained decline in cases over the last decade but rates of multi-drug resistant TB remains at very high levels. WHO regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said only 50 percent of an estimated 75 000 multi-drug resistant TB patients were found in 2013 and just half were successfully cured.\n\n\"Multi-drug resistant TB is still ravaging the European region, making it the most affected area of the entire world,\" he said. ECDC director, Marc Sprenger, said the EU countries were not all progressing in the same way and faced significant challenges in their TB control efforts. \"In most low-incident countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreign origin,\" he said.\n\nThere were 328 cases of TB reported in Ireland last year -- 7.1 per 100 000 -- the lowest notification rate recorded since surveillance began in 1998. The number of TB cases reported in Ireland has declined since the 1990s with 604 cases reported in 1992. The decline has been even more considerable since the early 1950s, when 7000 cases of TB were notified annually. Ireland is among the low-incidence countries in the EU and European Economic Area.\n\nHowever, there is concern that multi-drug resistant TB continues to be most prevalent in the 3 Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nAlso, TB is one of the diseases that kills most people with HIV and this deadly combination is increasing in Europe. The prevalence of HIV among TB cases throughout Europe increased from 3.4 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2013.\n\nOf the 60 296 TB cases notified in 2012 where there was a treatment outcome, 44 318 (73.5 percent) were treated successfully and 4571 died (7.6 percent). Of 1386 multi-drug resistant cases notified in 2011 where there was a treatment outcome, 524 (37.8 percent) were treated successfully and 235 (17 percent) died.\n\nA national TB surveillance report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC] [Ireland] for [2014] found that 40 percent of the 328 cases it was made aware of last year were foreign born. Men accounted for 54 percent of all cases. The HPSC was notified of 2 cases of multi-drug resistant TB and both were foreign-born and had no previous history of TB. There were 11 deaths, with TB reported as the cause in 3 cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above refers to: Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2015, published jointly by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC. Below is a summary; the full report is available at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/tuberculosis-surveillance-monitoring-Europe-2015.pdf.\n\n\"Executive Summary\n--------------------------\nThis is the 7th report launched jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe following on from reports under the EuroTB project, established in 1996.\n\nThe WHO European Region\n-----------------------------------\nDespite notable progress in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) is still a public health concern in most of the countries within the WHO European Region.\n\nIn 2013, an estimated 360 000 incident TB cases (range 340 000-370 000) occurred in the WHO European Region, equivalent to an average of 39 cases (38-41) per 100 000 population. 85 percent of incident TB cases in the Region occur in the 18 high-priority countries. In 2013, the absolute number of incident TB cases fell by 20 000 compared to the previous year, corresponding to 5.6 percent decline. Since 2001, TB incidence has been falling at an average rate of 4.3 percent per year.\n\nIn 2013, there were an estimated 460 000 prevalent TB cases (range 350 000-590 000), which is equivalent to 51 (39-65) cases per 100 000 population. Considering the downward trend observed during last decade, it seems feasible that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 50 percent reduction by 2015 against a baseline of 1990 will not be reached.\n\nThere were an estimated 38 000 TB deaths in 2013 among HIV-negative people in the European Region, equivalent to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (range 4.0-4.2). Yet, despite a constant decline in estimated mortality observed over the past 12 years, the MDG target will not be achieved in the Region.\n\nDuring the period 2004-2013, TB notification rates decreased by almost 20 percent, from 40.3 to 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. This trend reflects a true reduction in the spread of the disease, strongly influenced by the 17.7 percent decrease in notification rates throughout the Region's 18 high-priority countries (from 77.8 to 64.0 per 100 000 population).\n\nIn 2013, the 25-44 year age group was predominant (44 percent) among new TB cases registered in the European Region. The percentage of new TB patients under 15 years in the Region is around 4 percent.\n\nIn 2013, 17 096 (81.4 percent) TB cases with HIV co-infection were detected from approximately 21 000 cases in the European Region, based on an estimated prevalence of HIV infection among incident TB patients of 5.8 percent. Due to low HIV testing coverage (68 percent) the status was only known for 219 095 TB cases, 17 096 of which were determined to have HIV-co-infection. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive TB patients (from 62.3 percent in 2012 to 53.8 percent in 2013).\n\nOverall, 6.4 percent of the burden of new TB cases in the Region originated from prisons. In EU and EEA countries the proportion of TB cases detected in prisons was only 1.6 percent of all new TB cases detected in the country, while the corresponding proportion in non-EU countries was 7.4 percent. Overall, the notification rate of new TB cases in prisons within the WHO European Region was 893 per 100 000 population, indicating that the risk of developing TB in prisons was, on average, around 23 times higher than in the general population.\n\nOf an estimated 75 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases in the European Region in 2013, 34 941 (46.6 percent) were detected. The prevalence of MDR among new pulmonary TB cases in the Region amounted to 16.9 percent and was 48.0 percent among previously treated cases. Information relating to second-line drug susceptibility testing (SLD DST) remains limited as only a few countries provided data, altogether accounting for 12 percent of all notified MDR TB cases. Coverage of SLD DST among the reporting countries was 56.4 percent. In total, 532 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were detected, equivalent to 12.7 percent XDR prevalence among MDR TB patients.\n\nCoverage of 2nd-line TB treatment continued to improve in 2013. In total, 46 710 TB patients were enrolled into MDR treatment, 45 147 of whom had confirmed MDR TB. In 2013, the proportion of patients starting MDR treatment out of the total notified cases of MDR TB was 116.7 percent, or 110.7 percent including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB). In some countries the number of patients enrolled exceeded the total notified because prevalent MDR cases detected in previous years were still enrolled in treatment.\n\nTreatment success among new and relapse TB cases was 75.6 percent. Among previously treated cases (excluding relapses) it was 57.1 percent. The treatment success rate in the MDR TB cohort was 46.0 percent, which is lower than in 2012.\n\nGiven all of the above, and the fact that the vast majority of the TB burden occurs in the 18 high-priority countries of the European Region (85 percent of TB incidence, 86 percent of prevalence, 90 percent of the mortality caused by TB, 90 percent of TB/HIV co-infections and 99.5 percent of the MDR TB), the main efforts to combat and prevent TB in the Region still need to be focused there.\n\nIn collaboration with national and international partners and civil society organisations, WHO Regional Office for Europe has been implementing the Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2011-2015 at regional level and helping Member States to adopt evidence-based interventions in order to improve TB and M/XDR TB prevention and control. The WHO Regional Office for Europe has also established the European Green Light Committee and the European Laboratory Initiative to help countries develop and/or adjust their national plans in response to the M/ XDR-TB threat. Now that implementation of the Consolidated Action Plan is in its final year, and with the endorsement of the post-2015 global End TB Strategy by the 67th session of the World Health Assembly, Member States, WHO and partners are currently developing a new TB Action Plan for the WHO European Region, 2016-2020.\" - Mod.ML]\n\n[The Executive Summary ends with a section on European Union and European Economic Area countries. - Mod.JW]]\nSee Also\n2014\n----\nTuberculosis - Ukraine: anti-TB drug shortage, RFI 20141222.3047464\n2013\n----\nTuberculosis - France (02): ex former Soviet Union, MDR 20130818.1886543\nTuberculosis - France: (BD) school, Bejing strain 20130111.1493463\n2012\n---\nTuberculosis - UK: increasing drug resistance 20120709.1194280\nTuberculosis, MDR - worldwide: rates 20120206.1034331\n2011\n---\nTuberculosis - Ireland: (LN) prison, hospital 20111024.3165\nTuberculosis, drug resistance - Finland: (SK) 20110324.0935\n2010\n---\nTuberculosis - UK: resurgence 20101223.4522\n.................................................sb/ml/pg/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1992-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "4571-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1996-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2001-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Soviet Union", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Latvia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Estonia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LN", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Lithuania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Member States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "non - eu", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3566504", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - Belgium: (LI)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3566504", "date": "2015-03-19 22:02:05", "main_text": "TUBERCULOSIS - EUROPE: REPORT, EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL, WHO, 2015\n********************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 18 Mar 2015\nSource: Irish Examiner [edited]\nhttp://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/1000-cases-a-day-as-resistant-tb-ravages-europe-319075.html\n\n\nEvery day 1000 people throughout Europe develop tuberculosis, with one expert claiming that multi-drug resistant TB continues to \"ravage\" the region.\n\nWith World TB Day falling next Tuesday -- 24 Mar 2015 -- new data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for Europe shows that cases fell by 6 percent between 2012 and 2013. About 360 000 Europeans developed TB in 2013 but, even with an annual 6-percent decline, Europe will not be TB-free until the next century.\n\nThere has been a sustained decline in cases over the last decade but rates of multi-drug resistant TB remains at very high levels. WHO regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said only 50 percent of an estimated 75 000 multi-drug resistant TB patients were found in 2013 and just half were successfully cured.\n\n\"Multi-drug resistant TB is still ravaging the European region, making it the most affected area of the entire world,\" he said. ECDC director, Marc Sprenger, said the EU countries were not all progressing in the same way and faced significant challenges in their TB control efforts. \"In most low-incident countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreign origin,\" he said.\n\nThere were 328 cases of TB reported in Ireland last year -- 7.1 per 100 000 -- the lowest notification rate recorded since surveillance began in 1998. The number of TB cases reported in Ireland has declined since the 1990s with 604 cases reported in 1992. The decline has been even more considerable since the early 1950s, when 7000 cases of TB were notified annually. Ireland is among the low-incidence countries in the EU and European Economic Area.\n\nHowever, there is concern that multi-drug resistant TB continues to be most prevalent in the 3 Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nAlso, TB is one of the diseases that kills most people with HIV and this deadly combination is increasing in Europe. The prevalence of HIV among TB cases throughout Europe increased from 3.4 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2013.\n\nOf the 60 296 TB cases notified in 2012 where there was a treatment outcome, 44 318 (73.5 percent) were treated successfully and 4571 died (7.6 percent). Of 1386 multi-drug resistant cases notified in 2011 where there was a treatment outcome, 524 (37.8 percent) were treated successfully and 235 (17 percent) died.\n\nA national TB surveillance report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC] [Ireland] for [2014] found that 40 percent of the 328 cases it was made aware of last year were foreign born. Men accounted for 54 percent of all cases. The HPSC was notified of 2 cases of multi-drug resistant TB and both were foreign-born and had no previous history of TB. There were 11 deaths, with TB reported as the cause in 3 cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above refers to: Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2015, published jointly by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC. Below is a summary; the full report is available at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/tuberculosis-surveillance-monitoring-Europe-2015.pdf.\n\n\"Executive Summary\n--------------------------\nThis is the 7th report launched jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe following on from reports under the EuroTB project, established in 1996.\n\nThe WHO European Region\n-----------------------------------\nDespite notable progress in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) is still a public health concern in most of the countries within the WHO European Region.\n\nIn 2013, an estimated 360 000 incident TB cases (range 340 000-370 000) occurred in the WHO European Region, equivalent to an average of 39 cases (38-41) per 100 000 population. 85 percent of incident TB cases in the Region occur in the 18 high-priority countries. In 2013, the absolute number of incident TB cases fell by 20 000 compared to the previous year, corresponding to 5.6 percent decline. Since 2001, TB incidence has been falling at an average rate of 4.3 percent per year.\n\nIn 2013, there were an estimated 460 000 prevalent TB cases (range 350 000-590 000), which is equivalent to 51 (39-65) cases per 100 000 population. Considering the downward trend observed during last decade, it seems feasible that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 50 percent reduction by 2015 against a baseline of 1990 will not be reached.\n\nThere were an estimated 38 000 TB deaths in 2013 among HIV-negative people in the European Region, equivalent to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (range 4.0-4.2). Yet, despite a constant decline in estimated mortality observed over the past 12 years, the MDG target will not be achieved in the Region.\n\nDuring the period 2004-2013, TB notification rates decreased by almost 20 percent, from 40.3 to 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. This trend reflects a true reduction in the spread of the disease, strongly influenced by the 17.7 percent decrease in notification rates throughout the Region's 18 high-priority countries (from 77.8 to 64.0 per 100 000 population).\n\nIn 2013, the 25-44 year age group was predominant (44 percent) among new TB cases registered in the European Region. The percentage of new TB patients under 15 years in the Region is around 4 percent.\n\nIn 2013, 17 096 (81.4 percent) TB cases with HIV co-infection were detected from approximately 21 000 cases in the European Region, based on an estimated prevalence of HIV infection among incident TB patients of 5.8 percent. Due to low HIV testing coverage (68 percent) the status was only known for 219 095 TB cases, 17 096 of which were determined to have HIV-co-infection. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive TB patients (from 62.3 percent in 2012 to 53.8 percent in 2013).\n\nOverall, 6.4 percent of the burden of new TB cases in the Region originated from prisons. In EU and EEA countries the proportion of TB cases detected in prisons was only 1.6 percent of all new TB cases detected in the country, while the corresponding proportion in non-EU countries was 7.4 percent. Overall, the notification rate of new TB cases in prisons within the WHO European Region was 893 per 100 000 population, indicating that the risk of developing TB in prisons was, on average, around 23 times higher than in the general population.\n\nOf an estimated 75 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases in the European Region in 2013, 34 941 (46.6 percent) were detected. The prevalence of MDR among new pulmonary TB cases in the Region amounted to 16.9 percent and was 48.0 percent among previously treated cases. Information relating to second-line drug susceptibility testing (SLD DST) remains limited as only a few countries provided data, altogether accounting for 12 percent of all notified MDR TB cases. Coverage of SLD DST among the reporting countries was 56.4 percent. In total, 532 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were detected, equivalent to 12.7 percent XDR prevalence among MDR TB patients.\n\nCoverage of 2nd-line TB treatment continued to improve in 2013. In total, 46 710 TB patients were enrolled into MDR treatment, 45 147 of whom had confirmed MDR TB. In 2013, the proportion of patients starting MDR treatment out of the total notified cases of MDR TB was 116.7 percent, or 110.7 percent including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB). In some countries the number of patients enrolled exceeded the total notified because prevalent MDR cases detected in previous years were still enrolled in treatment.\n\nTreatment success among new and relapse TB cases was 75.6 percent. Among previously treated cases (excluding relapses) it was 57.1 percent. The treatment success rate in the MDR TB cohort was 46.0 percent, which is lower than in 2012.\n\nGiven all of the above, and the fact that the vast majority of the TB burden occurs in the 18 high-priority countries of the European Region (85 percent of TB incidence, 86 percent of prevalence, 90 percent of the mortality caused by TB, 90 percent of TB/HIV co-infections and 99.5 percent of the MDR TB), the main efforts to combat and prevent TB in the Region still need to be focused there.\n\nIn collaboration with national and international partners and civil society organisations, WHO Regional Office for Europe has been implementing the Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2011-2015 at regional level and helping Member States to adopt evidence-based interventions in order to improve TB and M/XDR TB prevention and control.

About 360 000 Europeans developed TB in 2013 but, even with an annual 6-percent decline, Europe will not be TB-free until the next century.\n\nThere has been a sustained decline in cases over the last decade but rates of multi-drug resistant TB remains at very high levels. WHO regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said only 50 percent of an estimated 75 000 multi-drug resistant TB patients were found in 2013 and just half were successfully cured.\n\n\"Multi-drug resistant TB is still ravaging the European region, making it the most affected area of the entire world,\" he said. ECDC director, Marc Sprenger, said the EU countries were not all progressing in the same way and faced significant challenges in their TB control efforts. \"In most low-incident countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreign origin,\" he said.\n\nThere were 328 cases of TB reported in Ireland last year -- 7.1 per 100 000 -- the lowest notification rate recorded since surveillance began in 1998. The number of TB cases reported in Ireland has declined since the 1990s with 604 cases reported in 1992. The decline has been even more considerable since the early 1950s, when 7000 cases of TB were notified annually. Ireland is among the low-incidence countries in the EU and European Economic Area.\n\nHowever, there is concern that multi-drug resistant TB continues to be most prevalent in the 3 Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nAlso, TB is one of the diseases that kills most people with HIV and this deadly combination is increasing in Europe. The prevalence of HIV among TB cases throughout Europe increased from 3.4 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2013.\n\nOf the 60 296 TB cases notified in 2012 where there was a treatment outcome, 44 318 (73.5 percent) were treated successfully and 4571 died (7.6 percent). Of 1386 multi-drug resistant cases notified in 2011 where there was a treatment outcome, 524 (37.8 percent) were treated successfully and 235 (17 percent) died.\n\nA national TB surveillance report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC] [Ireland] for [2014] found that 40 percent of the 328 cases it was made aware of last year were foreign born. Men accounted for 54 percent of all cases. The HPSC was notified of 2 cases of multi-drug resistant TB and both were foreign-born and had no previous history of TB. There were 11 deaths, with TB reported as the cause in 3 cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above refers to: Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2015, published jointly by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC. Below is a summary; the full report is available at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/tuberculosis-surveillance-monitoring-Europe-2015.pdf.\n\n\"Executive Summary\n--------------------------\nThis is the 7th report launched jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe following on from reports under the EuroTB project, established in 1996.\n\nThe WHO European Region\n-----------------------------------\nDespite notable progress in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) is still a public health concern in most of the countries within the WHO European Region.\n\nIn 2013, an estimated 360 000 incident TB cases (range 340 000-370 000) occurred in the WHO European Region, equivalent to an average of 39 cases (38-41) per 100 000 population. 85 percent of incident TB cases in the Region occur in the 18 high-priority countries. In 2013, the absolute number of incident TB cases fell by 20 000 compared to the previous year, corresponding to 5.6 percent decline. Since 2001, TB incidence has been falling at an average rate of 4.3 percent per year.\n\nIn 2013, there were an estimated 460 000 prevalent TB cases (range 350 000-590 000), which is equivalent to 51 (39-65) cases per 100 000 population. Considering the downward trend observed during last decade, it seems feasible that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 50 percent reduction by 2015 against a baseline of 1990 will not be reached.\n\nThere were an estimated 38 000 TB deaths in 2013 among HIV-negative people in the European Region, equivalent to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (range 4.0-4.2). Yet, despite a constant decline in estimated mortality observed over the past 12 years, the MDG target will not be achieved in the Region.\n\nDuring the period 2004-2013, TB notification rates decreased by almost 20 percent, from 40.3 to 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. This trend reflects a true reduction in the spread of the disease, strongly influenced by the 17.7 percent decrease in notification rates throughout the Region's 18 high-priority countries (from 77.8 to 64.0 per 100 000 population).\n\nIn 2013, the 25-44 year age group was predominant (44 percent) among new TB cases registered in the European Region. The percentage of new TB patients under 15 years in the Region is around 4 percent.\n\nIn 2013, 17 096 (81.4 percent) TB cases with HIV co-infection were detected from approximately 21 000 cases in the European Region, based on an estimated prevalence of HIV infection among incident TB patients of 5.8 percent. Due to low HIV testing coverage (68 percent) the status was only known for 219 095 TB cases, 17 096 of which were determined to have HIV-co-infection. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive TB patients (from 62.3 percent in 2012 to 53.8 percent in 2013).\n\nOverall, 6.4 percent of the burden of new TB cases in the Region originated from prisons. In EU and EEA countries the proportion of TB cases detected in prisons was only 1.6 percent of all new TB cases detected in the country, while the corresponding proportion in non-EU countries was 7.4 percent. Overall, the notification rate of new TB cases in prisons within the WHO European Region was 893 per 100 000 population, indicating that the risk of developing TB in prisons was, on average, around 23 times higher than in the general population.\n\nOf an estimated 75 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases in the European Region in 2013, 34 941 (46.6 percent) were detected. The prevalence of MDR among new pulmonary TB cases in the Region amounted to 16.9 percent and was 48.0 percent among previously treated cases. Information relating to second-line drug susceptibility testing (SLD DST) remains limited as only a few countries provided data, altogether accounting for 12 percent of all notified MDR TB cases. Coverage of SLD DST among the reporting countries was 56.4 percent. In total, 532 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were detected, equivalent to 12.7 percent XDR prevalence among MDR TB patients.\n\nCoverage of 2nd-line TB treatment continued to improve in 2013. In total, 46 710 TB patients were enrolled into MDR treatment, 45 147 of whom had confirmed MDR TB. In 2013, the proportion of patients starting MDR treatment out of the total notified cases of MDR TB was 116.7 percent, or 110.7 percent including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB). In some countries the number of patients enrolled exceeded the total notified because prevalent MDR cases detected in previous years were still enrolled in treatment.\n\nTreatment success among new and relapse TB cases was 75.6 percent. Among previously treated cases (excluding relapses) it was 57.1 percent. The treatment success rate in the MDR TB cohort was 46.0 percent, which is lower than in 2012.\n\nGiven all of the above, and the fact that the vast majority of the TB burden occurs in the 18 high-priority countries of the European Region (85 percent of TB incidence, 86 percent of prevalence, 90 percent of the mortality caused by TB, 90 percent of TB/HIV co-infections and 99.5 percent of the MDR TB), the main efforts to combat and prevent TB in the Region still need to be focused there.\n\nIn collaboration with national and international partners and civil society organisations, WHO Regional Office for Europe has been implementing the Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2011-2015 at regional level and helping Member States to adopt evidence-based interventions in order to improve TB and M/XDR TB prevention and control.

Now that implementation of the Consolidated Action Plan is in its final year, and with the endorsement of the post-2015 global End TB Strategy by the 67th session of the World Health Assembly, Member States, WHO and partners are currently developing a new TB Action Plan for the WHO European Region, 2016-2020.\" - Mod.ML]\n\n[The Executive Summary ends with a section on European Union and European Economic Area countries. - Mod.JW]]\nSee Also\n2014\n----\nTuberculosis - Ukraine: anti-TB drug shortage, RFI 20141222.3047464\n2013\n----\nTuberculosis - France (02): ex former Soviet Union, MDR 20130818.1886543\nTuberculosis - France: (BD) school, Bejing strain 20130111.1493463\n2012\n---\nTuberculosis - UK: increasing drug resistance 20120709.1194280\nTuberculosis, MDR - worldwide: rates 20120206.1034331\n2011\n---\nTuberculosis - Ireland: (LN) prison, hospital 20111024.3165\nTuberculosis, drug resistance - Finland: (SK) 20110324.0935\n2010\n---\nTuberculosis - UK: resurgence 20101223.4522\n.................................................sb/ml/pg/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "1998-03-16 00:00:00", "1992-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "4571-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1996-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2001-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "1990-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Soviet Union", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Latvia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Estonia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LN", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Lithuania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Member States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "non - eu", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3408645", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Tuberculosis - worldwide: children, isoniazid resistance", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3408645", "date": "2015-03-19 22:02:05", "main_text": "TUBERCULOSIS - EUROPE: REPORT, EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL, WHO, 2015\n********************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 18 Mar 2015\nSource: Irish Examiner [edited]\nhttp://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/1000-cases-a-day-as-resistant-tb-ravages-europe-319075.html\n\n\nEvery day 1000 people throughout Europe develop tuberculosis, with one expert claiming that multi-drug resistant TB continues to \"ravage\" the region.\n\nWith World TB Day falling next Tuesday -- 24 Mar 2015 -- new data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for Europe shows that cases fell by 6 percent between 2012 and 2013. About 360 000 Europeans developed TB in 2013 but, even with an annual 6-percent decline, Europe will not be TB-free until the next century.\n\nThere has been a sustained decline in cases over the last decade but rates of multi-drug resistant TB remains at very high levels. WHO regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said only 50 percent of an estimated 75 000 multi-drug resistant TB patients were found in 2013 and just half were successfully cured.\n\n\"Multi-drug resistant TB is still ravaging the European region, making it the most affected area of the entire world,\" he said. ECDC director, Marc Sprenger, said the EU countries were not all progressing in the same way and faced significant challenges in their TB control efforts. \"In most low-incident countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreign origin,\" he said.\n\nThere were 328 cases of TB reported in Ireland last year -- 7.1 per 100 000 -- the lowest notification rate recorded since surveillance began in 1998. The number of TB cases reported in Ireland has declined since the 1990s with 604 cases reported in 1992. The decline has been even more considerable since the early 1950s, when 7000 cases of TB were notified annually. Ireland is among the low-incidence countries in the EU and European Economic Area.\n\nHowever, there is concern that multi-drug resistant TB continues to be most prevalent in the 3 Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nAlso, TB is one of the diseases that kills most people with HIV and this deadly combination is increasing in Europe. The prevalence of HIV among TB cases throughout Europe increased from 3.4 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2013.\n\nOf the 60 296 TB cases notified in 2012 where there was a treatment outcome, 44 318 (73.5 percent) were treated successfully and 4571 died (7.6 percent). Of 1386 multi-drug resistant cases notified in 2011 where there was a treatment outcome, 524 (37.8 percent) were treated successfully and 235 (17 percent) died.\n\nA national TB surveillance report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC] [Ireland] for [2014] found that 40 percent of the 328 cases it was made aware of last year were foreign born. Men accounted for 54 percent of all cases. The HPSC was notified of 2 cases of multi-drug resistant TB and both were foreign-born and had no previous history of TB. There were 11 deaths, with TB reported as the cause in 3 cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above refers to: Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2015, published jointly by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC. Below is a summary; the full report is available at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/tuberculosis-surveillance-monitoring-Europe-2015.pdf.\n\n\"Executive Summary\n--------------------------\nThis is the 7th report launched jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe following on from reports under the EuroTB project, established in 1996.\n\nThe WHO European Region\n-----------------------------------\nDespite notable progress in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) is still a public health concern in most of the countries within the WHO European Region.\n\nIn 2013, an estimated 360 000 incident TB cases (range 340 000-370 000) occurred in the WHO European Region, equivalent to an average of 39 cases (38-41) per 100 000 population. 85 percent of incident TB cases in the Region occur in the 18 high-priority countries. In 2013, the absolute number of incident TB cases fell by 20 000 compared to the previous year, corresponding to 5.6 percent decline. Since 2001, TB incidence has been falling at an average rate of 4.3 percent per year.\n\nIn 2013, there were an estimated 460 000 prevalent TB cases (range 350 000-590 000), which is equivalent to 51 (39-65) cases per 100 000 population. Considering the downward trend observed during last decade, it seems feasible that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 50 percent reduction by 2015 against a baseline of 1990 will not be reached.\n\nThere were an estimated 38 000 TB deaths in 2013 among HIV-negative people in the European Region, equivalent to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (range 4.0-4.2). Yet, despite a constant decline in estimated mortality observed over the past 12 years, the MDG target will not be achieved in the Region.\n\nDuring the period 2004-2013, TB notification rates decreased by almost 20 percent, from 40.3 to 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. This trend reflects a true reduction in the spread of the disease, strongly influenced by the 17.7 percent decrease in notification rates throughout the Region's 18 high-priority countries (from 77.8 to 64.0 per 100 000 population).\n\nIn 2013, the 25-44 year age group was predominant (44 percent) among new TB cases registered in the European Region. The percentage of new TB patients under 15 years in the Region is around 4 percent.\n\nIn 2013, 17 096 (81.4 percent) TB cases with HIV co-infection were detected from approximately 21 000 cases in the European Region, based on an estimated prevalence of HIV infection among incident TB patients of 5.8 percent. Due to low HIV testing coverage (68 percent) the status was only known for 219 095 TB cases, 17 096 of which were determined to have HIV-co-infection. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive TB patients (from 62.3 percent in 2012 to 53.8 percent in 2013).\n\nOverall, 6.4 percent of the burden of new TB cases in the Region originated from prisons. In EU and EEA countries the proportion of TB cases detected in prisons was only 1.6 percent of all new TB cases detected in the country, while the corresponding proportion in non-EU countries was 7.4 percent. Overall, the notification rate of new TB cases in prisons within the WHO European Region was 893 per 100 000 population, indicating that the risk of developing TB in prisons was, on average, around 23 times higher than in the general population.\n\nOf an estimated 75 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases in the European Region in 2013, 34 941 (46.6 percent) were detected. The prevalence of MDR among new pulmonary TB cases in the Region amounted to 16.9 percent and was 48.0 percent among previously treated cases. Information relating to second-line drug susceptibility testing (SLD DST) remains limited as only a few countries provided data, altogether accounting for 12 percent of all notified MDR TB cases. Coverage of SLD DST among the reporting countries was 56.4 percent. In total, 532 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were detected, equivalent to 12.7 percent XDR prevalence among MDR TB patients.\n\nCoverage of 2nd-line TB treatment continued to improve in 2013. In total, 46 710 TB patients were enrolled into MDR treatment, 45 147 of whom had confirmed MDR TB. In 2013, the proportion of patients starting MDR treatment out of the total notified cases of MDR TB was 116.7 percent, or 110.7 percent including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB). In some countries the number of patients enrolled exceeded the total notified because prevalent MDR cases detected in previous years were still enrolled in treatment.\n\nTreatment success among new and relapse TB cases was 75.6 percent. Among previously treated cases (excluding relapses) it was 57.1 percent. The treatment success rate in the MDR TB cohort was 46.0 percent, which is lower than in 2012.\n\nGiven all of the above, and the fact that the vast majority of the TB burden occurs in the 18 high-priority countries of the European Region (85 percent of TB incidence, 86 percent of prevalence, 90 percent of the mortality caused by TB, 90 percent of TB/HIV co-infections and 99.5 percent of the MDR TB), the main efforts to combat and prevent TB in the Region still need to be focused there.\n\nIn collaboration with national and international partners and civil society organisations, WHO Regional Office for Europe has been implementing the Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2011-2015 at regional level and helping Member States to adopt evidence-based interventions in order to improve TB and M/XDR TB prevention and control.

About 360 000 Europeans developed TB in 2013 but, even with an annual 6-percent decline, Europe will not be TB-free until the next century.\n\nThere has been a sustained decline in cases over the last decade but rates of multi-drug resistant TB remains at very high levels. WHO regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said only 50 percent of an estimated 75 000 multi-drug resistant TB patients were found in 2013 and just half were successfully cured.\n\n\"Multi-drug resistant TB is still ravaging the European region, making it the most affected area of the entire world,\" he said. ECDC director, Marc Sprenger, said the EU countries were not all progressing in the same way and faced significant challenges in their TB control efforts. \"In most low-incident countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreign origin,\" he said.\n\nThere were 328 cases of TB reported in Ireland last year -- 7.1 per 100 000 -- the lowest notification rate recorded since surveillance began in 1998. The number of TB cases reported in Ireland has declined since the 1990s with 604 cases reported in 1992. The decline has been even more considerable since the early 1950s, when 7000 cases of TB were notified annually. Ireland is among the low-incidence countries in the EU and European Economic Area.\n\nHowever, there is concern that multi-drug resistant TB continues to be most prevalent in the 3 Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nAlso, TB is one of the diseases that kills most people with HIV and this deadly combination is increasing in Europe. The prevalence of HIV among TB cases throughout Europe increased from 3.4 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2013.\n\nOf the 60 296 TB cases notified in 2012 where there was a treatment outcome, 44 318 (73.5 percent) were treated successfully and 4571 died (7.6 percent). Of 1386 multi-drug resistant cases notified in 2011 where there was a treatment outcome, 524 (37.8 percent) were treated successfully and 235 (17 percent) died.\n\nA national TB surveillance report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC] [Ireland] for [2014] found that 40 percent of the 328 cases it was made aware of last year were foreign born. Men accounted for 54 percent of all cases. The HPSC was notified of 2 cases of multi-drug resistant TB and both were foreign-born and had no previous history of TB. There were 11 deaths, with TB reported as the cause in 3 cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above refers to: Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2015, published jointly by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC. Below is a summary; the full report is available at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/tuberculosis-surveillance-monitoring-Europe-2015.pdf.\n\n\"Executive Summary\n--------------------------\nThis is the 7th report launched jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe following on from reports under the EuroTB project, established in 1996.\n\nThe WHO European Region\n-----------------------------------\nDespite notable progress in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) is still a public health concern in most of the countries within the WHO European Region.\n\nIn 2013, an estimated 360 000 incident TB cases (range 340 000-370 000) occurred in the WHO European Region, equivalent to an average of 39 cases (38-41) per 100 000 population. 85 percent of incident TB cases in the Region occur in the 18 high-priority countries. In 2013, the absolute number of incident TB cases fell by 20 000 compared to the previous year, corresponding to 5.6 percent decline. Since 2001, TB incidence has been falling at an average rate of 4.3 percent per year.\n\nIn 2013, there were an estimated 460 000 prevalent TB cases (range 350 000-590 000), which is equivalent to 51 (39-65) cases per 100 000 population. Considering the downward trend observed during last decade, it seems feasible that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 50 percent reduction by 2015 against a baseline of 1990 will not be reached.\n\nThere were an estimated 38 000 TB deaths in 2013 among HIV-negative people in the European Region, equivalent to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (range 4.0-4.2). Yet, despite a constant decline in estimated mortality observed over the past 12 years, the MDG target will not be achieved in the Region.\n\nDuring the period 2004-2013, TB notification rates decreased by almost 20 percent, from 40.3 to 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. This trend reflects a true reduction in the spread of the disease, strongly influenced by the 17.7 percent decrease in notification rates throughout the Region's 18 high-priority countries (from 77.8 to 64.0 per 100 000 population).\n\nIn 2013, the 25-44 year age group was predominant (44 percent) among new TB cases registered in the European Region. The percentage of new TB patients under 15 years in the Region is around 4 percent.\n\nIn 2013, 17 096 (81.4 percent) TB cases with HIV co-infection were detected from approximately 21 000 cases in the European Region, based on an estimated prevalence of HIV infection among incident TB patients of 5.8 percent. Due to low HIV testing coverage (68 percent) the status was only known for 219 095 TB cases, 17 096 of which were determined to have HIV-co-infection. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive TB patients (from 62.3 percent in 2012 to 53.8 percent in 2013).\n\nOverall, 6.4 percent of the burden of new TB cases in the Region originated from prisons. In EU and EEA countries the proportion of TB cases detected in prisons was only 1.6 percent of all new TB cases detected in the country, while the corresponding proportion in non-EU countries was 7.4 percent. Overall, the notification rate of new TB cases in prisons within the WHO European Region was 893 per 100 000 population, indicating that the risk of developing TB in prisons was, on average, around 23 times higher than in the general population.\n\nOf an estimated 75 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases in the European Region in 2013, 34 941 (46.6 percent) were detected. The prevalence of MDR among new pulmonary TB cases in the Region amounted to 16.9 percent and was 48.0 percent among previously treated cases. Information relating to second-line drug susceptibility testing (SLD DST) remains limited as only a few countries provided data, altogether accounting for 12 percent of all notified MDR TB cases. Coverage of SLD DST among the reporting countries was 56.4 percent. In total, 532 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were detected, equivalent to 12.7 percent XDR prevalence among MDR TB patients.\n\nCoverage of 2nd-line TB treatment continued to improve in 2013. In total, 46 710 TB patients were enrolled into MDR treatment, 45 147 of whom had confirmed MDR TB. In 2013, the proportion of patients starting MDR treatment out of the total notified cases of MDR TB was 116.7 percent, or 110.7 percent including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB). In some countries the number of patients enrolled exceeded the total notified because prevalent MDR cases detected in previous years were still enrolled in treatment.\n\nTreatment success among new and relapse TB cases was 75.6 percent. Among previously treated cases (excluding relapses) it was 57.1 percent. The treatment success rate in the MDR TB cohort was 46.0 percent, which is lower than in 2012.\n\nGiven all of the above, and the fact that the vast majority of the TB burden occurs in the 18 high-priority countries of the European Region (85 percent of TB incidence, 86 percent of prevalence, 90 percent of the mortality caused by TB, 90 percent of TB/HIV co-infections and 99.5 percent of the MDR TB), the main efforts to combat and prevent TB in the Region still need to be focused there.\n\nIn collaboration with national and international partners and civil society organisations, WHO Regional Office for Europe has been implementing the Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2011-2015 at regional level and helping Member States to adopt evidence-based interventions in order to improve TB and M/XDR TB prevention and control.

Ranks 1, 2 were leishmaniasis and brucellosis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following media report in The Jordan Times dated Sat 30 Mar 2013 may serve as\nbackground information on the current status of human tuberculosis in Jordan:\n\nhttp://jordantimes.com/ministry-to-halt-implementation-of-plan-to-eliminate-tb\n\"The [Jordanian] Ministry of Health is planning to put its strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) on hold, according to its secretary general. Deifallah Lozi said the Kingdom is facing new challenges with the discovery of 50 TB [tuberculosis] cases among Syrian refugees, noting that this will affect Jordan's efforts to completely eliminate the disease.\n\n\"Speaking late on Thursday [28 Mar 2013] at a ceremony to mark the annual 24 March World TB Day, the secretary general explained that Jordan is one of the few countries worldwide that has met the World Health Organisation's benchmark to reduce the global TB burden ahead of the 2015 target year. The Kingdom achieved this goal in 2010, when TB prevalence in Jordan was 6 cases per 100 000 people, a drop of over 50 per cent from 1995, when it was 14 cases per 100 000.\n\n\"However, with the high prevalence of the disease among Syrian refugees, the Kingdom's plans to eliminate it will stop, according to Lozi, who called on the international community to support Jordan in providing healthcare services for Syrian refugees. According to official figures, 330 TB cases were discovered among Jordanians in 2012 [5.1 per 100 000], and 69 cases among non-Jordanians residing in the country.\n\n\"In addition, 50 cases -- 5 of them are multi-drug resistant -- were discovered among Syrians in Jordan.\n\n\"Also at Thursday's [28 Mar 2013] ceremony, the Jordan Tuberculosis Association announced that it will establish a specialised centre for the treatment of TB patients. Currently, there is only one healthcare centre specialised in treating TB patients, and it is located in Mafraq Governorate, 80 km [49.7 km] northeast of Amman, according to Khaled Abu Rumman, director of the National Programme to Stop TB.\n\n\"In 2011, 233 TB cases were detected among Jordanians [3.6 per 100 000], compared with 232 in 2010 and 272 in 2009.\"\n\n_Mycobacterium bovis_ can be transmitted from infected animals to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ can also occur. Following ingestion of _M. bovis_-contaminated food, _M. bovis_ most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. These forms of _M. bovis_ infection occur commonly in children and were common in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of _M. bovis_, primary pulmonary _M. bovis_ infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs.\n\nReactivation of latent _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection can occur in later life and can clinically resemble disease due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Differentiation of pulmonary infection due to _M. bovis_ from that due to _M. tuberculosis_ requires special microbiologic laboratory tests that are not done routinely.\n\nFrom the WAHID database, Jordan is said to have 312 and 234 human cases of bovine tuberculosis reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, we are not told how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans in Jordan was confirmed. Routine microbiologic methods allow only identification of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\", which includes _M. tuberculosis_, as well as _M. bovis_. To distinguish _M. bovis_ from _M. tuberculosis_, spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions are done. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of _M. bovis_ infection might otherwise be missed.\n\nThe numbers of human cases of bovine tuberculosis in the WAHID site do not correspond to numbers given by The Jordan Times for 2011 and 2012. According to the Jordan Times news release above, the official numbers of cases of tuberculosis were 233 and 330 reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Ranks 1, 2 were leishmaniasis and brucellosis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following media report in The Jordan Times dated Sat 30 Mar 2013 may serve as\nbackground information on the current status of human tuberculosis in Jordan:\n\nhttp://jordantimes.com/ministry-to-halt-implementation-of-plan-to-eliminate-tb\n\"The [Jordanian] Ministry of Health is planning to put its strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) on hold, according to its secretary general. Deifallah Lozi said the Kingdom is facing new challenges with the discovery of 50 TB [tuberculosis] cases among Syrian refugees, noting that this will affect Jordan's efforts to completely eliminate the disease.\n\n\"Speaking late on Thursday [28 Mar 2013] at a ceremony to mark the annual 24 March World TB Day, the secretary general explained that Jordan is one of the few countries worldwide that has met the World Health Organisation's benchmark to reduce the global TB burden ahead of the 2015 target year. The Kingdom achieved this goal in 2010, when TB prevalence in Jordan was 6 cases per 100 000 people, a drop of over 50 per cent from 1995, when it was 14 cases per 100 000.\n\n\"However, with the high prevalence of the disease among Syrian refugees, the Kingdom's plans to eliminate it will stop, according to Lozi, who called on the international community to support Jordan in providing healthcare services for Syrian refugees. According to official figures, 330 TB cases were discovered among Jordanians in 2012 [5.1 per 100 000], and 69 cases among non-Jordanians residing in the country.\n\n\"In addition, 50 cases -- 5 of them are multi-drug resistant -- were discovered among Syrians in Jordan.\n\n\"Also at Thursday's [28 Mar 2013] ceremony, the Jordan Tuberculosis Association announced that it will establish a specialised centre for the treatment of TB patients. Currently, there is only one healthcare centre specialised in treating TB patients, and it is located in Mafraq Governorate, 80 km [49.7 km] northeast of Amman, according to Khaled Abu Rumman, director of the National Programme to Stop TB.\n\n\"In 2011, 233 TB cases were detected among Jordanians [3.6 per 100 000], compared with 232 in 2010 and 272 in 2009.\"\n\n_Mycobacterium bovis_ can be transmitted from infected animals to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ can also occur. Following ingestion of _M. bovis_-contaminated food, _M. bovis_ most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. These forms of _M. bovis_ infection occur commonly in children and were common in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of _M. bovis_, primary pulmonary _M. bovis_ infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs.\n\nReactivation of latent _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection can occur in later life and can clinically resemble disease due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Differentiation of pulmonary infection due to _M. bovis_ from that due to _M. tuberculosis_ requires special microbiologic laboratory tests that are not done routinely.\n\nFrom the WAHID database, Jordan is said to have 312 and 234 human cases of bovine tuberculosis reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, we are not told how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans in Jordan was confirmed. Routine microbiologic methods allow only identification of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\", which includes _M. tuberculosis_, as well as _M. bovis_. To distinguish _M. bovis_ from _M. tuberculosis_, spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions are done. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of _M. bovis_ infection might otherwise be missed.\n\nThe numbers of human cases of bovine tuberculosis in the WAHID site do not correspond to numbers given by The Jordan Times for 2011 and 2012. According to the Jordan Times news release above, the official numbers of cases of tuberculosis were 233 and 330 reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Ranks 1, 2 were leishmaniasis and brucellosis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following media report in The Jordan Times dated Sat 30 Mar 2013 may serve as\nbackground information on the current status of human tuberculosis in Jordan:\n\nhttp://jordantimes.com/ministry-to-halt-implementation-of-plan-to-eliminate-tb\n\"The [Jordanian] Ministry of Health is planning to put its strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) on hold, according to its secretary general. Deifallah Lozi said the Kingdom is facing new challenges with the discovery of 50 TB [tuberculosis] cases among Syrian refugees, noting that this will affect Jordan's efforts to completely eliminate the disease.\n\n\"Speaking late on Thursday [28 Mar 2013] at a ceremony to mark the annual 24 March World TB Day, the secretary general explained that Jordan is one of the few countries worldwide that has met the World Health Organisation's benchmark to reduce the global TB burden ahead of the 2015 target year. The Kingdom achieved this goal in 2010, when TB prevalence in Jordan was 6 cases per 100 000 people, a drop of over 50 per cent from 1995, when it was 14 cases per 100 000.\n\n\"However, with the high prevalence of the disease among Syrian refugees, the Kingdom's plans to eliminate it will stop, according to Lozi, who called on the international community to support Jordan in providing healthcare services for Syrian refugees. According to official figures, 330 TB cases were discovered among Jordanians in 2012 [5.1 per 100 000], and 69 cases among non-Jordanians residing in the country.\n\n\"In addition, 50 cases -- 5 of them are multi-drug resistant -- were discovered among Syrians in Jordan.\n\n\"Also at Thursday's [28 Mar 2013] ceremony, the Jordan Tuberculosis Association announced that it will establish a specialised centre for the treatment of TB patients. Currently, there is only one healthcare centre specialised in treating TB patients, and it is located in Mafraq Governorate, 80 km [49.7 km] northeast of Amman, according to Khaled Abu Rumman, director of the National Programme to Stop TB.\n\n\"In 2011, 233 TB cases were detected among Jordanians [3.6 per 100 000], compared with 232 in 2010 and 272 in 2009.\"\n\n_Mycobacterium bovis_ can be transmitted from infected animals to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ can also occur. Following ingestion of _M. bovis_-contaminated food, _M. bovis_ most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. These forms of _M. bovis_ infection occur commonly in children and were common in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of _M. bovis_, primary pulmonary _M. bovis_ infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs.\n\nReactivation of latent _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection can occur in later life and can clinically resemble disease due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Differentiation of pulmonary infection due to _M. bovis_ from that due to _M. tuberculosis_ requires special microbiologic laboratory tests that are not done routinely.\n\nFrom the WAHID database, Jordan is said to have 312 and 234 human cases of bovine tuberculosis reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, we are not told how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans in Jordan was confirmed. Routine microbiologic methods allow only identification of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\", which includes _M. tuberculosis_, as well as _M. bovis_. To distinguish _M. bovis_ from _M. tuberculosis_, spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions are done. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of _M. bovis_ infection might otherwise be missed.\n\nThe numbers of human cases of bovine tuberculosis in the WAHID site do not correspond to numbers given by The Jordan Times for 2011 and 2012. According to the Jordan Times news release above, the official numbers of cases of tuberculosis were 233 and 330 reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Deifallah Lozi said the Kingdom is facing new challenges with the discovery of 50 TB [tuberculosis] cases among Syrian refugees, noting that this will affect Jordan's efforts to completely eliminate the disease.\n\n\"Speaking late on Thursday [28 Mar 2013] at a ceremony to mark the annual 24 March World TB Day, the secretary general explained that Jordan is one of the few countries worldwide that has met the World Health Organisation's benchmark to reduce the global TB burden ahead of the 2015 target year. The Kingdom achieved this goal in 2010, when TB prevalence in Jordan was 6 cases per 100 000 people, a drop of over 50 per cent from 1995, when it was 14 cases per 100 000.\n\n\"However, with the high prevalence of the disease among Syrian refugees, the Kingdom's plans to eliminate it will stop, according to Lozi, who called on the international community to support Jordan in providing healthcare services for Syrian refugees. According to official figures, 330 TB cases were discovered among Jordanians in 2012 [5.1 per 100 000], and 69 cases among non-Jordanians residing in the country.\n\n\"In addition, 50 cases -- 5 of them are multi-drug resistant -- were discovered among Syrians in Jordan.\n\n\"Also at Thursday's [28 Mar 2013] ceremony, the Jordan Tuberculosis Association announced that it will establish a specialised centre for the treatment of TB patients. Currently, there is only one healthcare centre specialised in treating TB patients, and it is located in Mafraq Governorate, 80 km [49.7 km] northeast of Amman, according to Khaled Abu Rumman, director of the National Programme to Stop TB.\n\n\"In 2011, 233 TB cases were detected among Jordanians [3.6 per 100 000], compared with 232 in 2010 and 272 in 2009.\"\n\n_Mycobacterium bovis_ can be transmitted from infected animals to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ can also occur. Following ingestion of _M. bovis_-contaminated food, _M. bovis_ most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. These forms of _M. bovis_ infection occur commonly in children and were common in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of _M. bovis_, primary pulmonary _M. bovis_ infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs.\n\nReactivation of latent _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection can occur in later life and can clinically resemble disease due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Differentiation of pulmonary infection due to _M. bovis_ from that due to _M. tuberculosis_ requires special microbiologic laboratory tests that are not done routinely.\n\nFrom the WAHID database, Jordan is said to have 312 and 234 human cases of bovine tuberculosis reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, we are not told how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans in Jordan was confirmed. Routine microbiologic methods allow only identification of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\", which includes _M. tuberculosis_, as well as _M. bovis_. To distinguish _M. bovis_ from _M. tuberculosis_, spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions are done. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of _M. bovis_ infection might otherwise be missed.\n\nThe numbers of human cases of bovine tuberculosis in the WAHID site do not correspond to numbers given by The Jordan Times for 2011 and 2012. According to the Jordan Times news release above, the official numbers of cases of tuberculosis were 233 and 330 reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Ranks 1, 2 were leishmaniasis and brucellosis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following media report in The Jordan Times dated Sat 30 Mar 2013 may serve as\nbackground information on the current status of human tuberculosis in Jordan:\n\nhttp://jordantimes.com/ministry-to-halt-implementation-of-plan-to-eliminate-tb\n\"The [Jordanian] Ministry of Health is planning to put its strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) on hold, according to its secretary general. Deifallah Lozi said the Kingdom is facing new challenges with the discovery of 50 TB [tuberculosis] cases among Syrian refugees, noting that this will affect Jordan's efforts to completely eliminate the disease.\n\n\"Speaking late on Thursday [28 Mar 2013] at a ceremony to mark the annual 24 March World TB Day, the secretary general explained that Jordan is one of the few countries worldwide that has met the World Health Organisation's benchmark to reduce the global TB burden ahead of the 2015 target year. The Kingdom achieved this goal in 2010, when TB prevalence in Jordan was 6 cases per 100 000 people, a drop of over 50 per cent from 1995, when it was 14 cases per 100 000.\n\n\"However, with the high prevalence of the disease among Syrian refugees, the Kingdom's plans to eliminate it will stop, according to Lozi, who called on the international community to support Jordan in providing healthcare services for Syrian refugees. According to official figures, 330 TB cases were discovered among Jordanians in 2012 [5.1 per 100 000], and 69 cases among non-Jordanians residing in the country.\n\n\"In addition, 50 cases -- 5 of them are multi-drug resistant -- were discovered among Syrians in Jordan.\n\n\"Also at Thursday's [28 Mar 2013] ceremony, the Jordan Tuberculosis Association announced that it will establish a specialised centre for the treatment of TB patients. Currently, there is only one healthcare centre specialised in treating TB patients, and it is located in Mafraq Governorate, 80 km [49.7 km] northeast of Amman, according to Khaled Abu Rumman, director of the National Programme to Stop TB.\n\n\"In 2011, 233 TB cases were detected among Jordanians [3.6 per 100 000], compared with 232 in 2010 and 272 in 2009.\"\n\n_Mycobacterium bovis_ can be transmitted from infected animals to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ can also occur. Following ingestion of _M. bovis_-contaminated food, _M. bovis_ most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. These forms of _M. bovis_ infection occur commonly in children and were common in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of _M. bovis_, primary pulmonary _M. bovis_ infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs.\n\nReactivation of latent _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection can occur in later life and can clinically resemble disease due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Differentiation of pulmonary infection due to _M. bovis_ from that due to _M. tuberculosis_ requires special microbiologic laboratory tests that are not done routinely.\n\nFrom the WAHID database, Jordan is said to have 312 and 234 human cases of bovine tuberculosis reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, we are not told how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans in Jordan was confirmed. Routine microbiologic methods allow only identification of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\", which includes _M. tuberculosis_, as well as _M. bovis_. To distinguish _M. bovis_ from _M. tuberculosis_, spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions are done. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of _M. bovis_ infection might otherwise be missed.\n\nThe numbers of human cases of bovine tuberculosis in the WAHID site do not correspond to numbers given by The Jordan Times for 2011 and 2012. According to the Jordan Times news release above, the official numbers of cases of tuberculosis were 233 and 330 reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. We are not told if these were cases of tuberculosis due to _M. tuberculosis_ alone or were a total of cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ plus cases due to _M. tuberculosis_. These numbers also differ from those reported by WHO for 2011 (312 new cases) for Jordan at https://extranet.who.int/sree/Reports?op=Replet&name=%2FWHO_HQ_Reports%2FG2%2FPROD%2FEXT%2FTBCountryProfile&ISO2=JO&LAN=EN&outtype=html.\n\nClarification of the numbers of new cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ and that due to _M. tuberculosis_ in Jordan for 2011 and 2012 would be appreciated, as well as how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans was confirmed for the cases reported in the WAHID database.\n\nFor a discussion of cross-border spread of tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), see prior ProMED-mail posts: Tuberculosis - France (02): ex former Soviet Union, MDR 20130818.1886543;\nTuberculosis, drug resistance - Finland: (SK) 20110324.0935;

The Animal Health Board (AHB) said last week that a herd near Inglewood was suspected of having the disease.\n\nThe confirmation this week of the infection brings to 4 the number of herds near Inglewood with the disease. Two herds near Opunake also have it.\n\nThe new infection near Inglewood related to movements of animals between the infected herds, and there was also a direct movement relationship between the 2 Opunake herds, AHB regional coordinator Frank Pavitt, of Hamilton, said. \"So we know why these herds have been infected.\"\n\nHe hoped that the Taranaki outbreak, in which the 1st case was detected in January 2013, would be confined to the 6 herds already identified.\n\n\"We hope we're coming to the end of our investigation and that we've identified all the infections that are present. But it's still a work in progress. It's a dynamic investigation, so we don't know when it will be fully completed.\"\n\nPavitt said movements from the herd where the infection had just been confirmed would now have to be examined.\n\nThe AHB is holding meetings for farmers within a 10-km radius of the infected herds in the Opunake and Inglewood areas on 21 May 2013.\n\nPavitt said it was contacting all farmers in the 2 areas about the meetings. They were being sent factsheets about the infections in their area and about the new annual testing regime for cattle and deer over 12 months of age that will now be set in place.\n\n[Byline: Sue O'dowd]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The primary cause of tuberculosis in cattle is the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_. This bacterium is in the same family as bacteria that cause Johne's disease and leprosy. Adult cattle are usually infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing the bacteria into their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often infected by drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will ultimately determine the clinical signs of the disease.\n\nSince the bacteria are usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows, the commonest clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the infection. When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary gland.\n\nWhen calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the commonest lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.\n\nOther species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical signs. _M. avium_, causing infection by ingestion and lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _M. tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.\n\nLive, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_ with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce. In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not a different type of mycobacterium.\n\nNationwide, there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. State and federal meat inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of each cow for signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is eliminated.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.\n\nScience has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.\n\nWildlife reservoirs, such as the brush-tailed opossums tend to be part of the problem with this disease. In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight.\n\nOnce this strain has been genotyped, it will be clearer how these herds became infected. I have not seen a report of the genotype of the situation.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vetext/INF-DA/Tuberculosis.pdf. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1hiF.]\nSee Also\n2011\n----\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - New Zealand (02): possum reservoir 20111130.3490\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: badger vaccination 20111014.3087\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (06): (IN) 20110924.2891\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (05): (IN) 20110918.2839\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: alpaca, mastitis, implications 20110825.2588\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - UK (04): England 20110723.2219\nBovine tuberculosis, porcine - UK: Wales 20110717.2170\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - Canada: (BC) 20110626.1959\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (04): (AZ) ex Mexico 20110612.1793\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - UK (03): England 20110430.1341\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - UK (02): England 20110430.1332\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (03): (CA) 20110429.1328\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - New Zealand 20110417.1202\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (02): (MI) 20110416.1196\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: (Wales) badger control 20110328.0969\nBovine tuberculosis, cervid - USA: (MI) 20110322.0895\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA: (IN) 20110301.0670\n.................................................sb/tg/msp/tg/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-01-16 00:00:00", "2013-05-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taranaki", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Opunake", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pavitt", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1811709", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - UK (03): (England) control", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1811709", "date": "2013-05-11 23:08:29", "main_text": "BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS, BOVINE - NEW ZEALAND\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 9 May 2013\nSource: Stuff.co.nz [edited]\nhttp://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/lifestyle/8650750/TB-outbreak-investigation\n\n\nTaranaki's 6th case of bovine tuberculosis has been confirmed.

When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary gland.\n\nWhen calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the commonest lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.\n\nOther species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical signs. _M. avium_, causing infection by ingestion and lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _M. tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.\n\nLive, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_ with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce. In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not a different type of mycobacterium.\n\nNationwide, there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. State and federal meat inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of each cow for signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is eliminated.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.\n\nScience has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.\n\nWildlife reservoirs, such as the brush-tailed opossums tend to be part of the problem with this disease. In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight.\n\nOnce this strain has been genotyped, it will be clearer how these herds became infected.

These other bacteria are more important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.\n\nLive, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_ with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce. In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not a different type of mycobacterium.\n\nNationwide, there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. State and federal meat inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of each cow for signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is eliminated.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.\n\nScience has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.\n\nWildlife reservoirs, such as the brush-tailed opossums tend to be part of the problem with this disease. In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight.\n\nOnce this strain has been genotyped, it will be clearer how these herds became infected.

The Animal Health Board (AHB) said last week that a herd near Inglewood was suspected of having the disease.\n\nThe confirmation this week of the infection brings to 4 the number of herds near Inglewood with the disease. Two herds near Opunake also have it.\n\nThe new infection near Inglewood related to movements of animals between the infected herds, and there was also a direct movement relationship between the 2 Opunake herds, AHB regional coordinator Frank Pavitt, of Hamilton, said. \"So we know why these herds have been infected.\"\n\nHe hoped that the Taranaki outbreak, in which the 1st case was detected in January 2013, would be confined to the 6 herds already identified.\n\n\"We hope we're coming to the end of our investigation and that we've identified all the infections that are present. But it's still a work in progress.

This bacterium is in the same family as bacteria that cause Johne's disease and leprosy. Adult cattle are usually infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing the bacteria into their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often infected by drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will ultimately determine the clinical signs of the disease.\n\nSince the bacteria are usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows, the commonest clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the infection. When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary gland.\n\nWhen calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the commonest lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of these nodes.

When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is eliminated.\n\nTuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.\n\nScience has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.\n\nWildlife reservoirs, such as the brush-tailed opossums tend to be part of the problem with this disease. In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight.\n\nOnce this strain has been genotyped, it will be clearer how these herds became infected. I have not seen a report of the genotype of the situation.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vetext/INF-DA/Tuberculosis.pdf. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1hiF.]\nSee Also\n2011\n----\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - New Zealand (02): possum reservoir 20111130.3490\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: badger vaccination 20111014.3087\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (06): (IN) 20110924.2891\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (05): (IN) 20110918.2839\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: alpaca, mastitis, implications 20110825.2588\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - UK (04): England 20110723.2219\nBovine tuberculosis, porcine - UK: Wales 20110717.2170\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - Canada: (BC) 20110626.1959\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (04): (AZ) ex Mexico 20110612.1793\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - UK (03): England 20110430.1341\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - UK (02): England 20110430.1332\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (03): (CA) 20110429.1328\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - New Zealand 20110417.1202\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA (02): (MI) 20110416.1196\nBovine tuberculosis - UK: (Wales) badger control 20110328.0969\nBovine tuberculosis, cervid - USA: (MI) 20110322.0895\nBovine tuberculosis, bovine - USA: (IN) 20110301.0670\n.................................................sb/tg/msp/tg/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-01-16 00:00:00", "2013-05-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taranaki", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Opunake", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pavitt", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wales", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1703033", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Tuberculosis - India (02): MDR", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1703033", "date": "2013-03-24 12:30:15", "main_text": "TUBERCULOSIS - INDIA: (MAHARASHTRA), XDR\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Sat 23 Mar 2013\nSource: The Times of India [edited]\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-23/pune/37959675_1_xdr-tb-cases-pune-district-pune-city\n\n\nTwo cases of the dreaded extreme [extensively] drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the world's most untreatable form of TB, have been detected in Pune district for the 1st time ever.

TB has emerged as one of the most serious public health threats. With an estimated number of 66 000 multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in 2011, India tops the chart in South-East Asia. The actual number of MDR-TB cases, which are extremely difficult to treat, could range from 55 000 to 77 000, though the overall prevalence is just above 2 per cent.\n\nThe South-East Asia region harbours 89 000 estimated MDR-TB cases (72 000-108 000) accounting for more than 1/4th of the world's estimated MDR-TB cases in 2011. India ranks 2nd after China,\" says the World Health Organisation's latest report. India is miles ahead of others in the region. The 2 worst figures after India come from Indonesia (6620) and Myanmar (5500). \"We are not tackling MDR cases with seriousness, which is a mistake. Treating each MDR cases is 100 times more expensive than a regular TB case. The government needs to find MDR cases and treat them as quickly as possible,\" R Lakshminarayan, vice president (research) in the Public Health Foundation of India, who is not associated with the WHO report, told Deccan Herald.\n\nExtensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has been reported from 5 countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand) in the region. In December 2011, so called cases of \"totally drug-resistant TB\" that posed a big challenge to clinicians and public health authorities were reported in Mumbai.\n\nAs per the WHO estimates, prevalence and incidence rates of all forms of tuberculosis in India were respectively 249 and 181 per 100 000 population in 2011. As many as 24 persons (range is from a low of 15 to a high of 35) per 100 000 are killed by the bug. The spread and virulence of tuberculosis, particularly the resistant variety, compelled the central government to make TB a notifiable disease, which ensures reporting of TB cases from the private sector to the government programme and compulsory treatment. Patients jumping from one private doctor to another without completing the drug regimen contribute to a sharp increase in resistant TB cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED has previously posted reports on the problem India is having with MDR and XDR TB. MDR or multidrug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB. XDR or extensively drug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis caused by a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable drugs used to treat tuberculosis (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).\n\n1st line anti-TB drugs are: INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin; and 2nd line drugs are: amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, viomycin, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, cycloserine, and para-aminosalicylic acid (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971391). 3rd-line drugs include the macrolides (such as clarithromycin), clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid, imipenem, high-dose isoniazid, and several new investigational drugs.\n\nReferring to certain MDR strains from India as TDR-TB or totally drug resistant is problematic for several reasons. In January 2012, the WHO attempted to clarify the situation as follows (http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/tdrfaqs/en/index.html):\n\n\"The term \"totally drug resistant\" has not been clearly defined for tuberculosis. While the concept of \"total drug resistance\" is easily understood in general terms, in practice, in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST) is technically challenging, and limitations on the use of results remain: conventional DST for the drugs that define MDR and XDR-TB has been thoroughly studied and consensus reached on appropriate methods, critical drug concentrations that define resistance, and reliability and reproducibility of testing. Data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the remaining SLDs [2nd-line drugs] are either much more limited or have not been established, or the methodology for testing does not exist.\n\n\"Most importantly, correlation of DST results with clinical response to treatment has not yet been adequately established. Thus, a strain of TB with in vitro DST results showing resistance could in fact, in the patient, be susceptible to these drugs. The prognostic relevance of in vitro resistance to drugs without an internationally accepted and standardised drug susceptibility test, therefore, remains unclear, and current WHO recommendations advise against the use of these results to guide treatment.\n\n\"Lastly, new drugs are under development, and their effectiveness against these \"totally drug resistant\" strains has not yet been reported.\n\n\"For these reasons, the term \"totally drug resistant\" tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO. For now these cases are defined as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), according to WHO definitions.\"\n\nThe number of XDR TB cases in India is likely unknown because anti-TB drug susceptibility tests are not being systematically performed for a variety of reasons (http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/growing-tuberculosis-threat?page=0,2): In 2010, only 5 percent of patients who needed drug susceptibility testing were screened, and only 2 percent of the estimated 99 000 patients with MDR-TB received 2nd-line drug treatment through the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).\n\nIn a letter to the editor in the journal \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full), the authors say that patients, rather than seeking care in TB clinics where there is free treatment and drugs available under RNTCP, frequently seek help from private physicians who often mismanage their care: \"A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi [Dharavi, located in Mumbai, is one of the largest slums in the world] could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis.\"\n\nPune District in Maharashtra state of India had a population of 9 426 959 in 2011, making it the 4th most populous district in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district) and Pune city, the district headquarters, with a population of 3 115 431 in 2011, is the 9th largest metropolis in India, the 2nd largest in the state of Maharashtra after Mumbai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune). Pune is 220 km (136.7 miles) southeast of Mumbai (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/pocketmaps/mumbaipune.htm), where reports of problems with XDR TB were previously posted by ProMED-mail. Pimpri-Chinchwad, with population of 1 729 320, is a city in Pune district, located to the North-West of Pune on the Old Pune-Mumbai Highway.

TB has emerged as one of the most serious public health threats. With an estimated number of 66 000 multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in 2011, India tops the chart in South-East Asia. The actual number of MDR-TB cases, which are extremely difficult to treat, could range from 55 000 to 77 000, though the overall prevalence is just above 2 per cent.\n\nThe South-East Asia region harbours 89 000 estimated MDR-TB cases (72 000-108 000) accounting for more than 1/4th of the world's estimated MDR-TB cases in 2011. India ranks 2nd after China,\" says the World Health Organisation's latest report. India is miles ahead of others in the region. The 2 worst figures after India come from Indonesia (6620) and Myanmar (5500). \"We are not tackling MDR cases with seriousness, which is a mistake. Treating each MDR cases is 100 times more expensive than a regular TB case. The government needs to find MDR cases and treat them as quickly as possible,\" R Lakshminarayan, vice president (research) in the Public Health Foundation of India, who is not associated with the WHO report, told Deccan Herald.\n\nExtensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has been reported from 5 countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand) in the region. In December 2011, so called cases of \"totally drug-resistant TB\" that posed a big challenge to clinicians and public health authorities were reported in Mumbai.\n\nAs per the WHO estimates, prevalence and incidence rates of all forms of tuberculosis in India were respectively 249 and 181 per 100 000 population in 2011. As many as 24 persons (range is from a low of 15 to a high of 35) per 100 000 are killed by the bug. The spread and virulence of tuberculosis, particularly the resistant variety, compelled the central government to make TB a notifiable disease, which ensures reporting of TB cases from the private sector to the government programme and compulsory treatment. Patients jumping from one private doctor to another without completing the drug regimen contribute to a sharp increase in resistant TB cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED has previously posted reports on the problem India is having with MDR and XDR TB. MDR or multidrug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB. XDR or extensively drug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis caused by a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable drugs used to treat tuberculosis (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).\n\n1st line anti-TB drugs are: INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin; and 2nd line drugs are: amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, viomycin, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, cycloserine, and para-aminosalicylic acid (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971391). 3rd-line drugs include the macrolides (such as clarithromycin), clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid, imipenem, high-dose isoniazid, and several new investigational drugs.\n\nReferring to certain MDR strains from India as TDR-TB or totally drug resistant is problematic for several reasons. In January 2012, the WHO attempted to clarify the situation as follows (http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/tdrfaqs/en/index.html):\n\n\"The term \"totally drug resistant\" has not been clearly defined for tuberculosis. While the concept of \"total drug resistance\" is easily understood in general terms, in practice, in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST) is technically challenging, and limitations on the use of results remain: conventional DST for the drugs that define MDR and XDR-TB has been thoroughly studied and consensus reached on appropriate methods, critical drug concentrations that define resistance, and reliability and reproducibility of testing. Data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the remaining SLDs [2nd-line drugs] are either much more limited or have not been established, or the methodology for testing does not exist.\n\n\"Most importantly, correlation of DST results with clinical response to treatment has not yet been adequately established. Thus, a strain of TB with in vitro DST results showing resistance could in fact, in the patient, be susceptible to these drugs. The prognostic relevance of in vitro resistance to drugs without an internationally accepted and standardised drug susceptibility test, therefore, remains unclear, and current WHO recommendations advise against the use of these results to guide treatment.\n\n\"Lastly, new drugs are under development, and their effectiveness against these \"totally drug resistant\" strains has not yet been reported.\n\n\"For these reasons, the term \"totally drug resistant\" tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO. For now these cases are defined as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), according to WHO definitions.\"\n\nThe number of XDR TB cases in India is likely unknown because anti-TB drug susceptibility tests are not being systematically performed for a variety of reasons (http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/growing-tuberculosis-threat?page=0,2): In 2010, only 5 percent of patients who needed drug susceptibility testing were screened, and only 2 percent of the estimated 99 000 patients with MDR-TB received 2nd-line drug treatment through the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).\n\nIn a letter to the editor in the journal \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full), the authors say that patients, rather than seeking care in TB clinics where there is free treatment and drugs available under RNTCP, frequently seek help from private physicians who often mismanage their care: \"A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi [Dharavi, located in Mumbai, is one of the largest slums in the world] could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis.\"\n\nPune District in Maharashtra state of India had a population of 9 426 959 in 2011, making it the 4th most populous district in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district) and Pune city, the district headquarters, with a population of 3 115 431 in 2011, is the 9th largest metropolis in India, the 2nd largest in the state of Maharashtra after Mumbai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune). Pune is 220 km (136.7 miles) southeast of Mumbai (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/pocketmaps/mumbaipune.htm), where reports of problems with XDR TB were previously posted by ProMED-mail. Pimpri-Chinchwad, with population of 1 729 320, is a city in Pune district, located to the North-West of Pune on the Old Pune-Mumbai Highway.

TB has emerged as one of the most serious public health threats. With an estimated number of 66 000 multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in 2011, India tops the chart in South-East Asia. The actual number of MDR-TB cases, which are extremely difficult to treat, could range from 55 000 to 77 000, though the overall prevalence is just above 2 per cent.\n\nThe South-East Asia region harbours 89 000 estimated MDR-TB cases (72 000-108 000) accounting for more than 1/4th of the world's estimated MDR-TB cases in 2011. India ranks 2nd after China,\" says the World Health Organisation's latest report. India is miles ahead of others in the region. The 2 worst figures after India come from Indonesia (6620) and Myanmar (5500). \"We are not tackling MDR cases with seriousness, which is a mistake. Treating each MDR cases is 100 times more expensive than a regular TB case. The government needs to find MDR cases and treat them as quickly as possible,\" R Lakshminarayan, vice president (research) in the Public Health Foundation of India, who is not associated with the WHO report, told Deccan Herald.\n\nExtensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has been reported from 5 countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand) in the region. In December 2011, so called cases of \"totally drug-resistant TB\" that posed a big challenge to clinicians and public health authorities were reported in Mumbai.\n\nAs per the WHO estimates, prevalence and incidence rates of all forms of tuberculosis in India were respectively 249 and 181 per 100 000 population in 2011. As many as 24 persons (range is from a low of 15 to a high of 35) per 100 000 are killed by the bug. The spread and virulence of tuberculosis, particularly the resistant variety, compelled the central government to make TB a notifiable disease, which ensures reporting of TB cases from the private sector to the government programme and compulsory treatment. Patients jumping from one private doctor to another without completing the drug regimen contribute to a sharp increase in resistant TB cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED has previously posted reports on the problem India is having with MDR and XDR TB. MDR or multidrug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB. XDR or extensively drug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis caused by a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable drugs used to treat tuberculosis (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).\n\n1st line anti-TB drugs are: INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin; and 2nd line drugs are: amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, viomycin, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, cycloserine, and para-aminosalicylic acid (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971391). 3rd-line drugs include the macrolides (such as clarithromycin), clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid, imipenem, high-dose isoniazid, and several new investigational drugs.\n\nReferring to certain MDR strains from India as TDR-TB or totally drug resistant is problematic for several reasons. In January 2012, the WHO attempted to clarify the situation as follows (http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/tdrfaqs/en/index.html):\n\n\"The term \"totally drug resistant\" has not been clearly defined for tuberculosis. While the concept of \"total drug resistance\" is easily understood in general terms, in practice, in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST) is technically challenging, and limitations on the use of results remain: conventional DST for the drugs that define MDR and XDR-TB has been thoroughly studied and consensus reached on appropriate methods, critical drug concentrations that define resistance, and reliability and reproducibility of testing. Data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the remaining SLDs [2nd-line drugs] are either much more limited or have not been established, or the methodology for testing does not exist.\n\n\"Most importantly, correlation of DST results with clinical response to treatment has not yet been adequately established. Thus, a strain of TB with in vitro DST results showing resistance could in fact, in the patient, be susceptible to these drugs. The prognostic relevance of in vitro resistance to drugs without an internationally accepted and standardised drug susceptibility test, therefore, remains unclear, and current WHO recommendations advise against the use of these results to guide treatment.\n\n\"Lastly, new drugs are under development, and their effectiveness against these \"totally drug resistant\" strains has not yet been reported.\n\n\"For these reasons, the term \"totally drug resistant\" tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO. For now these cases are defined as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), according to WHO definitions.\"\n\nThe number of XDR TB cases in India is likely unknown because anti-TB drug susceptibility tests are not being systematically performed for a variety of reasons (http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/growing-tuberculosis-threat?page=0,2): In 2010, only 5 percent of patients who needed drug susceptibility testing were screened, and only 2 percent of the estimated 99 000 patients with MDR-TB received 2nd-line drug treatment through the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).\n\nIn a letter to the editor in the journal \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full), the authors say that patients, rather than seeking care in TB clinics where there is free treatment and drugs available under RNTCP, frequently seek help from private physicians who often mismanage their care: \"A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi [Dharavi, located in Mumbai, is one of the largest slums in the world] could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis.\"\n\nPune District in Maharashtra state of India had a population of 9 426 959 in 2011, making it the 4th most populous district in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district) and Pune city, the district headquarters, with a population of 3 115 431 in 2011, is the 9th largest metropolis in India, the 2nd largest in the state of Maharashtra after Mumbai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune). Pune is 220 km (136.7 miles) southeast of Mumbai (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/pocketmaps/mumbaipune.htm), where reports of problems with XDR TB were previously posted by ProMED-mail. Pimpri-Chinchwad, with population of 1 729 320, is a city in Pune district, located to the North-West of Pune on the Old Pune-Mumbai Highway. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimpri-Chinchwad). \"Peth\" is a term (from the Marathi language) for areas located within Pune City.\n\nA map of the states of India can be accessed at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/images/IndiaMap_tourism.gif.

TB has emerged as one of the most serious public health threats. With an estimated number of 66 000 multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in 2011, India tops the chart in South-East Asia. The actual number of MDR-TB cases, which are extremely difficult to treat, could range from 55 000 to 77 000, though the overall prevalence is just above 2 per cent.\n\nThe South-East Asia region harbours 89 000 estimated MDR-TB cases (72 000-108 000) accounting for more than 1/4th of the world's estimated MDR-TB cases in 2011. India ranks 2nd after China,\" says the World Health Organisation's latest report. India is miles ahead of others in the region. The 2 worst figures after India come from Indonesia (6620) and Myanmar (5500). \"We are not tackling MDR cases with seriousness, which is a mistake. Treating each MDR cases is 100 times more expensive than a regular TB case. The government needs to find MDR cases and treat them as quickly as possible,\" R Lakshminarayan, vice president (research) in the Public Health Foundation of India, who is not associated with the WHO report, told Deccan Herald.\n\nExtensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has been reported from 5 countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand) in the region. In December 2011, so called cases of \"totally drug-resistant TB\" that posed a big challenge to clinicians and public health authorities were reported in Mumbai.\n\nAs per the WHO estimates, prevalence and incidence rates of all forms of tuberculosis in India were respectively 249 and 181 per 100 000 population in 2011. As many as 24 persons (range is from a low of 15 to a high of 35) per 100 000 are killed by the bug. The spread and virulence of tuberculosis, particularly the resistant variety, compelled the central government to make TB a notifiable disease, which ensures reporting of TB cases from the private sector to the government programme and compulsory treatment. Patients jumping from one private doctor to another without completing the drug regimen contribute to a sharp increase in resistant TB cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED has previously posted reports on the problem India is having with MDR and XDR TB. MDR or multidrug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB. XDR or extensively drug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis caused by a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable drugs used to treat tuberculosis (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).\n\n1st line anti-TB drugs are: INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin; and 2nd line drugs are: amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, viomycin, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, cycloserine, and para-aminosalicylic acid (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971391). 3rd-line drugs include the macrolides (such as clarithromycin), clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid, imipenem, high-dose isoniazid, and several new investigational drugs.\n\nReferring to certain MDR strains from India as TDR-TB or totally drug resistant is problematic for several reasons. In January 2012, the WHO attempted to clarify the situation as follows (http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/tdrfaqs/en/index.html):\n\n\"The term \"totally drug resistant\" has not been clearly defined for tuberculosis. While the concept of \"total drug resistance\" is easily understood in general terms, in practice, in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST) is technically challenging, and limitations on the use of results remain: conventional DST for the drugs that define MDR and XDR-TB has been thoroughly studied and consensus reached on appropriate methods, critical drug concentrations that define resistance, and reliability and reproducibility of testing. Data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the remaining SLDs [2nd-line drugs] are either much more limited or have not been established, or the methodology for testing does not exist.\n\n\"Most importantly, correlation of DST results with clinical response to treatment has not yet been adequately established. Thus, a strain of TB with in vitro DST results showing resistance could in fact, in the patient, be susceptible to these drugs. The prognostic relevance of in vitro resistance to drugs without an internationally accepted and standardised drug susceptibility test, therefore, remains unclear, and current WHO recommendations advise against the use of these results to guide treatment.\n\n\"Lastly, new drugs are under development, and their effectiveness against these \"totally drug resistant\" strains has not yet been reported.\n\n\"For these reasons, the term \"totally drug resistant\" tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO. For now these cases are defined as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), according to WHO definitions.\"\n\nThe number of XDR TB cases in India is likely unknown because anti-TB drug susceptibility tests are not being systematically performed for a variety of reasons (http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/growing-tuberculosis-threat?page=0,2): In 2010, only 5 percent of patients who needed drug susceptibility testing were screened, and only 2 percent of the estimated 99 000 patients with MDR-TB received 2nd-line drug treatment through the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).\n\nIn a letter to the editor in the journal \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full), the authors say that patients, rather than seeking care in TB clinics where there is free treatment and drugs available under RNTCP, frequently seek help from private physicians who often mismanage their care: \"A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi [Dharavi, located in Mumbai, is one of the largest slums in the world] could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis.\"\n\nPune District in Maharashtra state of India had a population of 9 426 959 in 2011, making it the 4th most populous district in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district) and Pune city, the district headquarters, with a population of 3 115 431 in 2011, is the 9th largest metropolis in India, the 2nd largest in the state of Maharashtra after Mumbai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune). Pune is 220 km (136.7 miles) southeast of Mumbai (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/pocketmaps/mumbaipune.htm), where reports of problems with XDR TB were previously posted by ProMED-mail. Pimpri-Chinchwad, with population of 1 729 320, is a city in Pune district, located to the North-West of Pune on the Old Pune-Mumbai Highway.

All _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous 2 years. This report highlights once more the potential for _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting.\n\nAmong the different genotypes of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -- 1st described 20 years ago in the Chinese capital -- are now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype in a school.\n\nOutbreak description\n---------------------------\nIn January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of 3 sputum specimens did not detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but _M. tuberculosis_ was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous 6 months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. 3 sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and _M. tuberculosis_ susceptible to 1st-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured.\n\nResponse to 1st-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after 2 months. In early July 2012, as part of the investigation of these 2 cases by the local public health authorities for TB control, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a 2nd student in the same school (Case 3) who presented both clinical and radiological signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from sputum specimens, which also isolated drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_.\n\nContact tracing\n---------------\nThese cases of pulmonary TB clustered in time and place led to a broader investigation including a total of 334 individuals associated with this school in 2012, comprising students, teachers and administrative personnel. All were tested with interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and 30 tests were interpreted as positive. Those who tested positive were put on prophylactic medication with isoniazid. Family members of the 3 patients who had been in regular contact with the 3 and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in 2 students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_ isolates.\n\nThe investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.\n\nLaboratory investigations\n-------------------------\n_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all 1st-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a 2nd region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of _M. tuberculosis_ genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically severe picture in 3 of the 5 cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of 6 cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.\n\n[References are available in the URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPro-MED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne.

An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965;272:7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of tuberculosis occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school out, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted.\n\nMarseille, located on the southeast Mediterranean coast of France, is the 2nd largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of 852 395 within its administrative limits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille).

All _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous 2 years. This report highlights once more the potential for _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting.\n\nAmong the different genotypes of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -- 1st described 20 years ago in the Chinese capital -- are now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype in a school.\n\nOutbreak description\n---------------------------\nIn January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of 3 sputum specimens did not detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but _M. tuberculosis_ was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous 6 months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. 3 sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and _M. tuberculosis_ susceptible to 1st-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured.\n\nResponse to 1st-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after 2 months.

In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.\n\nLaboratory investigations\n-------------------------\n_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance.

All _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous 2 years. This report highlights once more the potential for _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting.\n\nAmong the different genotypes of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -- 1st described 20 years ago in the Chinese capital -- are now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype in a school.\n\nOutbreak description\n---------------------------\nIn January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of 3 sputum specimens did not detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but _M. tuberculosis_ was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous 6 months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. 3 sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and _M. tuberculosis_ susceptible to 1st-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured.\n\nResponse to 1st-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after 2 months. In early July 2012, as part of the investigation of these 2 cases by the local public health authorities for TB control, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a 2nd student in the same school (Case 3) who presented both clinical and radiological signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from sputum specimens, which also isolated drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_.\n\nContact tracing\n---------------\nThese cases of pulmonary TB clustered in time and place led to a broader investigation including a total of 334 individuals associated with this school in 2012, comprising students, teachers and administrative personnel. All were tested with interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and 30 tests were interpreted as positive. Those who tested positive were put on prophylactic medication with isoniazid. Family members of the 3 patients who had been in regular contact with the 3 and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in 2 students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_ isolates.\n\nThe investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.\n\nLaboratory investigations\n-------------------------\n_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all 1st-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a 2nd region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of _M. tuberculosis_ genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically severe picture in 3 of the 5 cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of 6 cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.\n\n[References are available in the URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPro-MED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne. Depending on the environment, these tiny particles (1-5 microns in diameter) can remain suspended for hours, and can be carried by air currents. If another person inhales these droplet nuclei, transmission may occur.\n\nThe probability that TB will be transmitted depends on the infectiousness of the person with TB (the number of organisms expelled into the air), the immune competence of the person exposed, the environment in which exposure occurred, the duration of exposure, and the virulence of the organism. Persons at highest risk for becoming infected with _M. tuberculosis_ are those having prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with infectious TB. Close contacts include family members, roommates, friends, coworkers, or others.\n\nPatients with laryngeal tuberculosis, an uncommon complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, are thought to be particularly contagious; although it is possible that concomitant far-advance pulmonary tuberculosis in these patients contributes to their infectivity (Braden CR, et al. Infectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70).\n\nMolecular typing of _M. tuberculosis_ strains in recent years has shown that a group of strains known as \"Beijing,\" which have a similar genotype, are most prevalent in Asia but have been found worldwide; these strains predominate in some geographic areas, and have caused large outbreaks of tuberculosis, sometimes involving multidrug resistance in some regions (Glynn JR, Whiteley J, Bifani PJ, Kremer K, van Soolingen D. Worldwide Occurrence of Beijing/W Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Systematic Review. Emerg Infect Dis. 2002 August; 8(8): 843-49. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732522/). One multidrug-resistant strain, designated \"W,\" belonging to the Beijing group, was found in New York City in the early 1990s and caused large institutional outbreaks of tuberculosis in the United States (Bifani PJ, Mathema B, Liu Z, Moghazeh SL, Shopsin B, Tempalski B, et al. Identification of a W variant outbreak of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ via population-based molecular epidemiology. JAMA. 1999;282:2321-7. Available at: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=192231).\n\nNumerous outbreaks of tuberculosis have been reported in schools. Just a brief Internet search disclosed 9 relatively recent reports of school outbreaks:\n(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1258456.stm,\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/tuberculosis-outbreaks-at-palm-beach-county-scho-1/nL7f4/,\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/education/tuberculosis-hits-a-second-school-delray-elementar/nL7cw/,\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-36016/Doctors-fight-major-TB-outbreak-school.html,\nhttp://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/249411/publisher_ID/40/,\nhttp://health.usnews.com/health-news/managing-your-healthcare/treatment/articles/2011/10/14/tb-outbreaks-in-texas-schools-show-disease-still-a-threat,\nhttp://www.independent.ie/national-news/pupils-tested-after-tb-outbreak-at-school-3113099.html,\nhttp://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/State-Health-Officials-Meet-With-Families-Over-Tuberculosis-Outbreak-130746098.html, and\nhttp://vaccinenewsdaily.com/united-states/321007-tb-cases-reported-at-two-san-diego-county-schools/).\n\nTransmission rates in classrooms have varied from 10 to 83 percent (Braden CR, et al.\nInfectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis\nClin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70). High rates of transmission have been reported to occur following even minimal exposure to an infectious patient or in an environment thought not to be conducive to transmission of tuberculosis (Braden CR, Investigative Team. Infectiousness of a university student with laryngeal and cavitary tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995;21:565-70; and Hoge CW, Fisher L, Donnell HD Jr, et al. Risk factors for transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in a primary school outbreak: lack of racial difference in susceptibility to infection. Am J Epidemiol 1994;139:520-30). As in the above Eurosurveillance report, some investigators have postulated that the strains involved in such outbreaks may be especially virulent (Valnay SE, Sanchez MPC, Shinnick TS, et al. An outbreak involving extensive transmission of a virulent strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. New Engl J Med 1998; 338:633-9. Available at:\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Outbreak%20Involving%20Extensive%20Transmission%20of%20a%20Virulent%20Strain%20of%20Mycobacterium%20TB.pdf).\n\nIn 1965, we described a large outbreak of tuberculosis that started in the fall of 1962 among medical students (11 cases) and employees of the medical school (11 cases) and medical college hospital (5 cases) (Alpert ME, Levison ME. An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965;272:7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of tuberculosis occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school out, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted.\n\nMarseille, located on the southeast Mediterranean coast of France, is the 2nd largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of 852 395 within its administrative limits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille).

High rates of transmission have been reported to occur following even minimal exposure to an infectious patient or in an environment thought not to be conducive to transmission of tuberculosis (Braden CR, Investigative Team. Infectiousness of a university student with laryngeal and cavitary tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995;21:565-70; and Hoge CW, Fisher L, Donnell HD Jr, et al. Risk factors for transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in a primary school outbreak: lack of racial difference in susceptibility to infection. Am J Epidemiol 1994;139:520-30). As in the above Eurosurveillance report, some investigators have postulated that the strains involved in such outbreaks may be especially virulent (Valnay SE, Sanchez MPC, Shinnick TS, et al. An outbreak involving extensive transmission of a virulent strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. New Engl J Med 1998; 338:633-9.

An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965;272:7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of tuberculosis occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school out, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted.\n\nMarseille, located on the southeast Mediterranean coast of France, is the 2nd largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of 852 395 within its administrative limits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille).

All _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous 2 years. This report highlights once more the potential for _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting.\n\nAmong the different genotypes of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -- 1st described 20 years ago in the Chinese capital -- are now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype in a school.\n\nOutbreak description\n---------------------------\nIn January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of 3 sputum specimens did not detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but _M. tuberculosis_ was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous 6 months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. 3 sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and _M. tuberculosis_ susceptible to 1st-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured.\n\nResponse to 1st-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after 2 months. In early July 2012, as part of the investigation of these 2 cases by the local public health authorities for TB control, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a 2nd student in the same school (Case 3) who presented both clinical and radiological signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from sputum specimens, which also isolated drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_.\n\nContact tracing\n---------------\nThese cases of pulmonary TB clustered in time and place led to a broader investigation including a total of 334 individuals associated with this school in 2012, comprising students, teachers and administrative personnel. All were tested with interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and 30 tests were interpreted as positive. Those who tested positive were put on prophylactic medication with isoniazid. Family members of the 3 patients who had been in regular contact with the 3 and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in 2 students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_ isolates.\n\nThe investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.\n\nLaboratory investigations\n-------------------------\n_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all 1st-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a 2nd region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of _M. tuberculosis_ genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically severe picture in 3 of the 5 cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of 6 cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.\n\n[References are available in the URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPro-MED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne. Depending on the environment, these tiny particles (1-5 microns in diameter) can remain suspended for hours, and can be carried by air currents. If another person inhales these droplet nuclei, transmission may occur.\n\nThe probability that TB will be transmitted depends on the infectiousness of the person with TB (the number of organisms expelled into the air), the immune competence of the person exposed, the environment in which exposure occurred, the duration of exposure, and the virulence of the organism. Persons at highest risk for becoming infected with _M. tuberculosis_ are those having prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with infectious TB. Close contacts include family members, roommates, friends, coworkers, or others.\n\nPatients with laryngeal tuberculosis, an uncommon complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, are thought to be particularly contagious; although it is possible that concomitant far-advance pulmonary tuberculosis in these patients contributes to their infectivity (Braden CR, et al. Infectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70).\n\nMolecular typing of _M. tuberculosis_ strains in recent years has shown that a group of strains known as \"Beijing,\" which have a similar genotype, are most prevalent in Asia but have been found worldwide; these strains predominate in some geographic areas, and have caused large outbreaks of tuberculosis, sometimes involving multidrug resistance in some regions (Glynn JR, Whiteley J, Bifani PJ, Kremer K, van Soolingen D. Worldwide Occurrence of Beijing/W Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Systematic Review. Emerg Infect Dis. 2002 August; 8(8): 843-49. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732522/). One multidrug-resistant strain, designated \"W,\" belonging to the Beijing group, was found in New York City in the early 1990s and caused large institutional outbreaks of tuberculosis in the United States (Bifani PJ, Mathema B, Liu Z, Moghazeh SL, Shopsin B, Tempalski B, et al.

As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.\n\n[References are available in the URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPro-MED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne. Depending on the environment, these tiny particles (1-5 microns in diameter) can remain suspended for hours, and can be carried by air currents. If another person inhales these droplet nuclei, transmission may occur.\n\nThe probability that TB will be transmitted depends on the infectiousness of the person with TB (the number of organisms expelled into the air), the immune competence of the person exposed, the environment in which exposure occurred, the duration of exposure, and the virulence of the organism. Persons at highest risk for becoming infected with _M. tuberculosis_ are those having prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with infectious TB. Close contacts include family members, roommates, friends, coworkers, or others.\n\nPatients with laryngeal tuberculosis, an uncommon complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, are thought to be particularly contagious; although it is possible that concomitant far-advance pulmonary tuberculosis in these patients contributes to their infectivity (Braden CR, et al. Infectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70).\n\nMolecular typing of _M. tuberculosis_ strains in recent years has shown that a group of strains known as \"Beijing,\" which have a similar genotype, are most prevalent in Asia but have been found worldwide; these strains predominate in some geographic areas, and have caused large outbreaks of tuberculosis, sometimes involving multidrug resistance in some regions (Glynn JR, Whiteley J, Bifani PJ, Kremer K, van Soolingen D.

An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965;272:7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of tuberculosis occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school out, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted.\n\nMarseille, located on the southeast Mediterranean coast of France, is the 2nd largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of 852 395 within its administrative limits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille).

All _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous 2 years. This report highlights once more the potential for _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting.\n\nAmong the different genotypes of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -- 1st described 20 years ago in the Chinese capital -- are now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype in a school.\n\nOutbreak description\n---------------------------\nIn January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of 3 sputum specimens did not detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) but _M. tuberculosis_ was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous 6 months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. 3 sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and _M. tuberculosis_ susceptible to 1st-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured.\n\nResponse to 1st-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after 2 months. In early July 2012, as part of the investigation of these 2 cases by the local public health authorities for TB control, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a 2nd student in the same school (Case 3) who presented both clinical and radiological signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from sputum specimens, which also isolated drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_.\n\nContact tracing\n---------------\nThese cases of pulmonary TB clustered in time and place led to a broader investigation including a total of 334 individuals associated with this school in 2012, comprising students, teachers and administrative personnel. All were tested with interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and 30 tests were interpreted as positive. Those who tested positive were put on prophylactic medication with isoniazid. Family members of the 3 patients who had been in regular contact with the 3 and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in 2 students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_ isolates.\n\nThe investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.\n\nLaboratory investigations\n-------------------------\n_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all 1st-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a 2nd region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of _M. tuberculosis_ genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically severe picture in 3 of the 5 cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of 6 cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.\n\n[References are available in the URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPro-MED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne.

Family members of the 3 patients who had been in regular contact with the 3 and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in 2 students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible _M. tuberculosis_ isolates.\n\nThe investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class 3 times per week with each session lasting 4 consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established.\n\nLaboratory investigations\n-------------------------\n_M. tuberculosis_ isolates collected in all 5 cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all 1st-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a 2nd region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of _M. tuberculosis_ genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nTo our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _M. tuberculosis_ Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically severe picture in 3 of the 5 cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of 6 cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of _M. tuberculosis_ [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France.\n\n[References are available in the URL above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPro-MED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When a person with pulmonary, especially cavitary, or laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, droplet nuclei containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can become airborne. Depending on the environment, these tiny particles (1-5 microns in diameter) can remain suspended for hours, and can be carried by air currents. If another person inhales these droplet nuclei, transmission may occur.\n\nThe probability that TB will be transmitted depends on the infectiousness of the person with TB (the number of organisms expelled into the air), the immune competence of the person exposed, the environment in which exposure occurred, the duration of exposure, and the virulence of the organism. Persons at highest risk for becoming infected with _M. tuberculosis_ are those having prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with infectious TB. Close contacts include family members, roommates, friends, coworkers, or others.\n\nPatients with laryngeal tuberculosis, an uncommon complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, are thought to be particularly contagious; although it is possible that concomitant far-advance pulmonary tuberculosis in these patients contributes to their infectivity (Braden CR, et al. Infectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70).\n\nMolecular typing of _M. tuberculosis_ strains in recent years has shown that a group of strains known as \"Beijing,\" which have a similar genotype, are most prevalent in Asia but have been found worldwide; these strains predominate in some geographic areas, and have caused large outbreaks of tuberculosis, sometimes involving multidrug resistance in some regions (Glynn JR, Whiteley J, Bifani PJ, Kremer K, van Soolingen D. Worldwide Occurrence of Beijing/W Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Systematic Review. Emerg Infect Dis. 2002 August; 8(8): 843-49. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732522/). One multidrug-resistant strain, designated \"W,\" belonging to the Beijing group, was found in New York City in the early 1990s and caused large institutional outbreaks of tuberculosis in the United States (Bifani PJ, Mathema B, Liu Z, Moghazeh SL, Shopsin B, Tempalski B, et al. Identification of a W variant outbreak of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ via population-based molecular epidemiology. JAMA. 1999;282:2321-7. Available at: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=192231).\n\nNumerous outbreaks of tuberculosis have been reported in schools. Just a brief Internet search disclosed 9 relatively recent reports of school outbreaks:\n(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1258456.stm,\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/tuberculosis-outbreaks-at-palm-beach-county-scho-1/nL7f4/,\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/education/tuberculosis-hits-a-second-school-delray-elementar/nL7cw/,\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-36016/Doctors-fight-major-TB-outbreak-school.html,\nhttp://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/249411/publisher_ID/40/,\nhttp://health.usnews.com/health-news/managing-your-healthcare/treatment/articles/2011/10/14/tb-outbreaks-in-texas-schools-show-disease-still-a-threat,\nhttp://www.independent.ie/national-news/pupils-tested-after-tb-outbreak-at-school-3113099.html,\nhttp://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/State-Health-Officials-Meet-With-Families-Over-Tuberculosis-Outbreak-130746098.html, and\nhttp://vaccinenewsdaily.com/united-states/321007-tb-cases-reported-at-two-san-diego-county-schools/).\n\nTransmission rates in classrooms have varied from 10 to 83 percent (Braden CR, et al.\nInfectiousness of a University Student with Laryngeal and Cavitary Tuberculosis\nClin Infect Dis 1995; 21: 565-70). High rates of transmission have been reported to occur following even minimal exposure to an infectious patient or in an environment thought not to be conducive to transmission of tuberculosis (Braden CR, Investigative Team. Infectiousness of a university student with laryngeal and cavitary tuberculosis. Clin Infect Dis 1995;21:565-70; and Hoge CW, Fisher L, Donnell HD Jr, et al. Risk factors for transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in a primary school outbreak: lack of racial difference in susceptibility to infection. Am J Epidemiol 1994;139:520-30). As in the above Eurosurveillance report, some investigators have postulated that the strains involved in such outbreaks may be especially virulent (Valnay SE, Sanchez MPC, Shinnick TS, et al. An outbreak involving extensive transmission of a virulent strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. New Engl J Med 1998; 338:633-9. Available at:\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Outbreak%20Involving%20Extensive%20Transmission%20of%20a%20Virulent%20Strain%20of%20Mycobacterium%20TB.pdf).\n\nIn 1965, we described a large outbreak of tuberculosis that started in the fall of 1962 among medical students (11 cases) and employees of the medical school (11 cases) and medical college hospital (5 cases) (Alpert ME, Levison ME. An epidemic of tuberculosis in a medical school. N Engl J Med 1965;272:7l8-21). In the medical school classes in which cases of tuberculosis occurred, the tuberculin skin test reactivity rose from 16 percent on average among medical students at admission to medical school to 69-90 percent among those students that had not been vaccinated with BCG on admission. No one source was identified in this medical school out, but school outbreaks should serve as a reminder that students, especially young children, serve as indicators of recent transmission that warrants prompt investigation for a source with active tuberculosis in their environment so that further transmission can be rapidly interrupted.\n\nMarseille, located on the southeast Mediterranean coast of France, is the 2nd largest city in France, after Paris, with a population of 852 395 within its administrative limits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille). Marseille is the capital of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region, as well as the capital of the Bouches-du-Rhone department.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of France can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/12KJ. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nTuberculosis - Canada: (ON) exposure, nosocomial, infants 20120806.1230363\nTuberculosis - USA: (FL) fatal, homeless shelter 20120710.1196037\n2011\n----\nTuberculosis - Ireland: (LN) prison, hospital 20111024.3165\nTuberculosis, latent, nosocomial, infants - Italy (03): (Rome) 20110901.2677\nTuberculosis, latent, nosocomial, infants - Italy (02): (Rome) 20110830.2668\nTuberculosis, latent, nosocomial, infants - Italy: (Rome) 20110825.2587\n2010\n----\nTuberculosis - Canada: (NU), Inuit 20101008.3659\nTuberculosis, children - UK: use of BCG vaccine 20100717.2386\n2009\n----\nTuberculosis, hospital exposures - USA: (IL) susp. 20090412.1398\nTuberculosis, airplane exposure - USA ex Germany 20090317.1081\n.................................................mpp/ml/ejp/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-01-10 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1972-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-01-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-09-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2002-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "1965-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Marseille", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "eurosurveillance", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rome", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Paris", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brignatz J", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LN", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beijing", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1487921", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Bovine tuberculosis - Netherlands: (GE) bovine, susp., RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1487921", "date": "2012-11-22 18:07:09", "main_text": "BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS - FRANCE: (MAYENNE, ARDENNES)\n*************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this posting:\n[1] Mayenne\n[2] Ardennes\n\n******\n[1] Mayenne\nDate: Fri 16 Nov 2012\nSource: Ouest-France [in French, machine trans., edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/d5oeh9r\n\n\nAn outbreak of bovine tuberculosis has been identified and confirmed by laboratory test in a cattle farm located in the municipality of Asse-le-Beranger, in the canton of Evron, Mayenne department.\n\nThe same farm was found infected during a previous outbreak, detected on the farm in 2006.

The following response, kindly forwarded by him, is gratefully acknowledged and much appreciated. - Mod.AS]\n\nI have been involved with several investigations into TB in camelids but didn't have any direct involvement with the recently reported case of TB in a person who had contact with an infected alpaca. The following link provides further details, presumably about the same case: http://www.alpacatb.com/news.html.\n\nThis person was at an unusually high risk of exposure to _Mycobacterium bovis_ by virtue of her work with infected alpacas. All animals infected with _M. bovis_ constitute a potential source of the bacterium for humans and tuberculous alpacas are no exception.

Federal officials have designated most of the Lower Peninsula as free of bovine TB. A high risk zone remains in Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency, and Oscoda counties. Presque Isle is among 7 counties in a mid-level zone.

BCG may cause a reaction to the\ntuberculin skin test (TST). The effect of BCG vaccination on TST\nreactivity is dependent on strain and dose of BCG used, the method of\nvaccine administration, the number of BCG vaccinations administered,\nthe age, weight, and nutritional status of the individual at the time\nof vaccination, genetic factors, and the time since vaccination (1).\nHowever, the BCG effect on the tuberculin skin test declines in both\nfrequency and size of the reaction over time. Studies have shown that\na TST applied several years after neonatal BCG vaccination usually\nproduces a reaction of less than 10 mm; TST reactions larger than 10\nmm are unlikely to occur in the absence of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection (2,3). Certainly neonatal BCG vaccination has\na minimal effect on the TST as an adolescent or adult; in a review of\n24 studies involving 240 203 subjects BCG-vaccinated as infants,\noverall 20 406 (8.5 percent) had a TST reaction of 10 mm or larger\nattributable to BCG, but only 56/5639 (1 percent) were TST-positive\n(10 mm or larger) if tested 10 years or more after BCG (4). Indeed,\nthe US CDC recommends that a history of BCG vaccination be disregarded\nwhen interpreting a TST (5).\n\nInterferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which use antigens that are\nspecific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, do not cause cross\nreactions with BCG, and therefore do not cause false-positive\nreactions in BCG recipients (6). A history of BCG vaccination should\nthus be an indication for use of an IGRA when screening for LTBI to\neliminate any confusion over interpretation of TST reactivity that\ncould complicate decisions about prescribing chemoprophylactic therapy\nfor LTBI.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

BCG may cause a reaction to the\ntuberculin skin test (TST). The effect of BCG vaccination on TST\nreactivity is dependent on strain and dose of BCG used, the method of\nvaccine administration, the number of BCG vaccinations administered,\nthe age, weight, and nutritional status of the individual at the time\nof vaccination, genetic factors, and the time since vaccination (1).\nHowever, the BCG effect on the tuberculin skin test declines in both\nfrequency and size of the reaction over time. Studies have shown that\na TST applied several years after neonatal BCG vaccination usually\nproduces a reaction of less than 10 mm; TST reactions larger than 10\nmm are unlikely to occur in the absence of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection (2,3). Certainly neonatal BCG vaccination has\na minimal effect on the TST as an adolescent or adult; in a review of\n24 studies involving 240 203 subjects BCG-vaccinated as infants,\noverall 20 406 (8.5 percent) had a TST reaction of 10 mm or larger\nattributable to BCG, but only 56/5639 (1 percent) were TST-positive\n(10 mm or larger) if tested 10 years or more after BCG (4). Indeed,\nthe US CDC recommends that a history of BCG vaccination be disregarded\nwhen interpreting a TST (5).\n\nInterferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which use antigens that are\nspecific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, do not cause cross\nreactions with BCG, and therefore do not cause false-positive\nreactions in BCG recipients (6). A history of BCG vaccination should\nthus be an indication for use of an IGRA when screening for LTBI to\neliminate any confusion over interpretation of TST reactivity that\ncould complicate decisions about prescribing chemoprophylactic therapy\nfor LTBI.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

BCG may cause a reaction to the\ntuberculin skin test (TST). The effect of BCG vaccination on TST\nreactivity is dependent on strain and dose of BCG used, the method of\nvaccine administration, the number of BCG vaccinations administered,\nthe age, weight, and nutritional status of the individual at the time\nof vaccination, genetic factors, and the time since vaccination (1).\nHowever, the BCG effect on the tuberculin skin test declines in both\nfrequency and size of the reaction over time. Studies have shown that\na TST applied several years after neonatal BCG vaccination usually\nproduces a reaction of less than 10 mm; TST reactions larger than 10\nmm are unlikely to occur in the absence of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection (2,3). Certainly neonatal BCG vaccination has\na minimal effect on the TST as an adolescent or adult; in a review of\n24 studies involving 240 203 subjects BCG-vaccinated as infants,\noverall 20 406 (8.5 percent) had a TST reaction of 10 mm or larger\nattributable to BCG, but only 56/5639 (1 percent) were TST-positive\n(10 mm or larger) if tested 10 years or more after BCG (4). Indeed,\nthe US CDC recommends that a history of BCG vaccination be disregarded\nwhen interpreting a TST (5).\n\nInterferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which use antigens that are\nspecific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, do not cause cross\nreactions with BCG, and therefore do not cause false-positive\nreactions in BCG recipients (6). A history of BCG vaccination should\nthus be an indication for use of an IGRA when screening for LTBI to\neliminate any confusion over interpretation of TST reactivity that\ncould complicate decisions about prescribing chemoprophylactic therapy\nfor LTBI.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

BCG may cause a reaction to the\ntuberculin skin test (TST). The effect of BCG vaccination on TST\nreactivity is dependent on strain and dose of BCG used, the method of\nvaccine administration, the number of BCG vaccinations administered,\nthe age, weight, and nutritional status of the individual at the time\nof vaccination, genetic factors, and the time since vaccination (1).\nHowever, the BCG effect on the tuberculin skin test declines in both\nfrequency and size of the reaction over time. Studies have shown that\na TST applied several years after neonatal BCG vaccination usually\nproduces a reaction of less than 10 mm; TST reactions larger than 10\nmm are unlikely to occur in the absence of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection (2,3). Certainly neonatal BCG vaccination has\na minimal effect on the TST as an adolescent or adult; in a review of\n24 studies involving 240 203 subjects BCG-vaccinated as infants,\noverall 20 406 (8.5 percent) had a TST reaction of 10 mm or larger\nattributable to BCG, but only 56/5639 (1 percent) were TST-positive\n(10 mm or larger) if tested 10 years or more after BCG (4). Indeed,\nthe US CDC recommends that a history of BCG vaccination be disregarded\nwhen interpreting a TST (5).\n\nInterferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which use antigens that are\nspecific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, do not cause cross\nreactions with BCG, and therefore do not cause false-positive\nreactions in BCG recipients (6). A history of BCG vaccination should\nthus be an indication for use of an IGRA when screening for LTBI to\neliminate any confusion over interpretation of TST reactivity that\ncould complicate decisions about prescribing chemoprophylactic therapy\nfor LTBI.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

BCG may cause a reaction to the\ntuberculin skin test (TST). The effect of BCG vaccination on TST\nreactivity is dependent on strain and dose of BCG used, the method of\nvaccine administration, the number of BCG vaccinations administered,\nthe age, weight, and nutritional status of the individual at the time\nof vaccination, genetic factors, and the time since vaccination (1).\nHowever, the BCG effect on the tuberculin skin test declines in both\nfrequency and size of the reaction over time. Studies have shown that\na TST applied several years after neonatal BCG vaccination usually\nproduces a reaction of less than 10 mm; TST reactions larger than 10\nmm are unlikely to occur in the absence of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection (2,3). Certainly neonatal BCG vaccination has\na minimal effect on the TST as an adolescent or adult; in a review of\n24 studies involving 240 203 subjects BCG-vaccinated as infants,\noverall 20 406 (8.5 percent) had a TST reaction of 10 mm or larger\nattributable to BCG, but only 56/5639 (1 percent) were TST-positive\n(10 mm or larger) if tested 10 years or more after BCG (4). Indeed,\nthe US CDC recommends that a history of BCG vaccination be disregarded\nwhen interpreting a TST (5).\n\nInterferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which use antigens that are\nspecific for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, do not cause cross\nreactions with BCG, and therefore do not cause false-positive\nreactions in BCG recipients (6). A history of BCG vaccination should\nthus be an indication for use of an IGRA when screening for LTBI to\neliminate any confusion over interpretation of TST reactivity that\ncould complicate decisions about prescribing chemoprophylactic therapy\nfor LTBI.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The event cattle operation has\nbeen placed under quarantine. The affected steer was recently imported\ninto the state of Arizona from Mexico and tested negative for bovine\nTB at the time of importation. The positive diagnosis was determined\nwhen the steer was retested to meet another state's entry\nrequirement.\n\n\"This diagnosis is a reminder of how important it is to keep high\nrisk imported steers and spayed heifers separate from domestic beef\nand dairy breeding cattle,\" stated Acting State Veterinarian John\nHunt. Hunt says since there is no treatment for cattle infected with\nbovine tuberculosis, exposed cattle must be either tested or\ndepopulated. Given that the time from an animal's exposure to a\npositive test can be several months, it can take months of testing to\nensure the disease is eradicated from a herd.\n\nArizona has been declared free of bovine tuberculosis since 1978.\n\"Free status\" was temporarily suspended due to an incident in 1979 but\nwas reinstated in 1981 after prompt elimination of the disease.\n\nThe State Veterinarian and the ADA veterinary staff are working\nclosely with USDA officials to implement the best course of action to\neliminate the disease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic problem in Mexico, albeit mainly in\nthe states away from the US border.

From 1 Jan to 30 Sep 2010, 87 TB cases were diagnosed in\nNunavut, with 92 per cent of them [80 cases] in the Baffin region,\nsaid Elaine Randell, communicable disease consultant with Nunavut's\nDepartment of Health and Social Services. She added 40 of those cases\nwere in Iqaluit, 27 in Cape Dorset, and the rest in other\ncommunities. Randell also said 15 to 24-year-olds were hit the hardest.\n\nThe outbreak peaked in May [2010]. Only 3 TB cases were diagnosed in\nthe territory in September. \"There seems to be a downward trend,\nalthough with TB, it's probably too early to tell but we're hoping\nthat this is the beginning of a downward trend,\" she said. \"It would\nappear that Iqaluit and Cape Dorset both have their own strains.

Randell said they are also revising the TB manual for\nhealth care workers and developing a communications strategy. She\nsaid they have even offered taxi vouchers as incentives for people to\ncome for treatment. \"For the most part, most of the clients have been\nvery co-operative in helping us,\" she said. In Cape Dorset, mayor\nCary Merritt, as the general manager of the local co-op, has provided\nfood vouchers to the co-op's restaurant as an incentive for people to\nfollow their treatment. \"It's helping making sure people come in to\nget their treatments on time,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not so worried because we have a really good nurse in place\nright now.

I think we will see a drastic reduction now.\"\n\n[Byline: Jeanne Gagnon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of\nWestern Europe; it comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and\nhas an estimated population in 2010 of about 33 000, mostly Inuit\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut>). The territorial capital\nIqaluit, which had a population in 2006 of 6184, is on Baffin Island,\nwhich had a population of 11 000 in 2007. Cape Dorset is a town\nlocated on Dorset Island at the southern tip of Baffin Island with a\npopulation in 2006 of 1236.\n\nThe TB incidence rate for the first 9 months of 2010 is thus 727 per\n100 000 in the Baffin region with 80 cases, 647 per 100 000 in\nIqaluit with 40 cases, and 2184 per 100 000 in Cape Dorset with 27\ncases, whereas the annual incidence rate for Canada as a whole has\nbeen reported to be less than 5 per 100 000\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tbpc-latb/itir-eng.php>).\n\nAboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the Inuit, First Nations, and\nMetis (indigenous First People of Canada who trace their descent to\nmixed European and First Nations parentage)\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada>). The\n2006 census counted a total Canadian Aboriginal population of 1 172\n790 (3.75 percent of the population), which includes 698 025 First\nNations (2.23 percent), 389 785 Metis (1.25 percent), and 50 480\nInuit (0.16 percent) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada>).\n\nSince the 1st contact with Europeans, the Canadian Aboriginals have\nhad a disproportionately high burden of TB disease. For example, high\nincidence rates for TB have been reported among Aboriginals, mainly\nFirst Nations, in Northern Manitoba: specifically 48.4 per 100 000\noverall, with rates as high as 496.3 per 100 000 in select\ncommunities (<http://www.skylarkmedicalclinic.com/TubercuosisinManitoba.htm>).\n\nIn 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/tbcbap-tbpac/special_report-eng.php>)\nreported that from 1991-1999, of 17 590 new active and relapsed TB\ncases, 3013 (17 percent) occurred among Canadian-born Aboriginals\n(which constitute only 3.75 percent of the population). Of the\nremaining cases, 4201 (24 percent) occurred in Canadian-born\nnon-Aboriginals and 10 281 (58 percent) occurred in foreign-born\nindividuals. Aboriginals with TB were younger (median 27 years) than\nforeign-born (median 39 years) and non-Aboriginals (median 59 years).\nIn this report, drug resistant strains of TB had not yet emerged as a\nsignificant problem in this population. Less than 2 percent of\nreported cases were resistant to one or more drugs. The extent of HIV\nco-infection could not be estimated using data from this surveillance\nsystem. (HIV status was known for only 2 percent of reported\nAboriginal cases.) In the 1990's, Aboriginal people were said to have\nan overall TB rate almost 4 times higher than the Canada-wide rate.\n\nMore recently, the situation has apparently worsened. In a news\nrelease in March 2010, the Inuit were reported to be \"the most at\nrisk of tuberculosis infection with a rate that is 186 times higher\nthan the non-aboriginal average. This is double what it was just 4\nyears ago\"\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\nThe high rates for TB in the Canadian Aboriginal population have been\nattributed to limited access to healthcare in remote regions,\nsubstandard housing, with whole families living in a single room,\nwidespread poverty, and malnutrition\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\n\nThe TB control plan described in the news release above seems\ninadequate for the situation. For example, the treatment plan in\nNunavut relies on the patients self-administering medication. Because\nof the frequency of non-adherence to TB treatment regimens in all\npopulations, directly observed therapy (DOTS) is the internationally\nrecommended strategy for TB case management. DOTS requires an\nindependent observer watching patients swallow each dose of their\nanti-TB therapy. The independent observer is not necessarily a\nhealthcare worker; the person could be, for example, a tribal elder\nor similar senior person within that community. Because drug\nresistance and HIV co-infection may require modification of the TB\ntreatment regimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf>), HIV\nstatus and drug resistance should be determined in each case, if not\ndone already, in the current outbreak in Nunavut.\n\nA program to prevent latent from becoming active disease should\naccompany early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its\nprompt and complete treatment. Most cases of progression from latent\nTB to active tuberculosis occur within 2 to 12 months of initial\ninfection. Children and adolescents are especially at high risk for\nprogression to tuberculosis disease (with potential for disseminated\ndisease). Most children with latent TB have been recently infected\n(especially those younger than age 5 years), usually from exposure to\na person with active TB in their immediate environment, usually the\nhousehold. Children exposed to active TB must be evaluated and\ntreated for latent TB. TB control requires government commitment of\nfunds and personnel more than a single nurse in the field for such a\nlarge and remote region, even though she may be \"a really good nurse\".\n\nA map of Nunavut, Baffin Island, and the towns of Cape Dorset and\nIqaluit can be found at\n<http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/reference/provincesterritories/nunavut/referencemap_image_view>.\nNunavut can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map\nof Canada at <http://healthmap.org/r/0ccp>. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, children - UK: use of BCG vaccine 20100717.2386\n...................................ml/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The territorial capital\nIqaluit, which had a population in 2006 of 6184, is on Baffin Island,\nwhich had a population of 11 000 in 2007. Cape Dorset is a town\nlocated on Dorset Island at the southern tip of Baffin Island with a\npopulation in 2006 of 1236.\n\nThe TB incidence rate for the first 9 months of 2010 is thus 727 per\n100 000 in the Baffin region with 80 cases, 647 per 100 000 in\nIqaluit with 40 cases, and 2184 per 100 000 in Cape Dorset with 27\ncases, whereas the annual incidence rate for Canada as a whole has\nbeen reported to be less than 5 per 100 000\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tbpc-latb/itir-eng.php>).\n\nAboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the Inuit, First Nations, and\nMetis (indigenous First People of Canada who trace their descent to\nmixed European and First Nations parentage)\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada>). The\n2006 census counted a total Canadian Aboriginal population of 1 172\n790 (3.75 percent of the population), which includes 698 025 First\nNations (2.23 percent), 389 785 Metis (1.25 percent), and 50 480\nInuit (0.16 percent) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada>).\n\nSince the 1st contact with Europeans, the Canadian Aboriginals have\nhad a disproportionately high burden of TB disease. For example, high\nincidence rates for TB have been reported among Aboriginals, mainly\nFirst Nations, in Northern Manitoba: specifically 48.4 per 100 000\noverall, with rates as high as 496.3 per 100 000 in select\ncommunities (<http://www.skylarkmedicalclinic.com/TubercuosisinManitoba.htm>).\n\nIn 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/tbcbap-tbpac/special_report-eng.php>)\nreported that from 1991-1999, of 17 590 new active and relapsed TB\ncases, 3013 (17 percent) occurred among Canadian-born Aboriginals\n(which constitute only 3.75 percent of the population). Of the\nremaining cases, 4201 (24 percent) occurred in Canadian-born\nnon-Aboriginals and 10 281 (58 percent) occurred in foreign-born\nindividuals. Aboriginals with TB were younger (median 27 years) than\nforeign-born (median 39 years) and non-Aboriginals (median 59 years).\nIn this report, drug resistant strains of TB had not yet emerged as a\nsignificant problem in this population. Less than 2 percent of\nreported cases were resistant to one or more drugs. The extent of HIV\nco-infection could not be estimated using data from this surveillance\nsystem. (HIV status was known for only 2 percent of reported\nAboriginal cases.) In the 1990's, Aboriginal people were said to have\nan overall TB rate almost 4 times higher than the Canada-wide rate.\n\nMore recently, the situation has apparently worsened. In a news\nrelease in March 2010, the Inuit were reported to be \"the most at\nrisk of tuberculosis infection with a rate that is 186 times higher\nthan the non-aboriginal average. This is double what it was just 4\nyears ago\"\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\nThe high rates for TB in the Canadian Aboriginal population have been\nattributed to limited access to healthcare in remote regions,\nsubstandard housing, with whole families living in a single room,\nwidespread poverty, and malnutrition\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\n\nThe TB control plan described in the news release above seems\ninadequate for the situation. For example, the treatment plan in\nNunavut relies on the patients self-administering medication. Because\nof the frequency of non-adherence to TB treatment regimens in all\npopulations, directly observed therapy (DOTS) is the internationally\nrecommended strategy for TB case management. DOTS requires an\nindependent observer watching patients swallow each dose of their\nanti-TB therapy. The independent observer is not necessarily a\nhealthcare worker; the person could be, for example, a tribal elder\nor similar senior person within that community. Because drug\nresistance and HIV co-infection may require modification of the TB\ntreatment regimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf>), HIV\nstatus and drug resistance should be determined in each case, if not\ndone already, in the current outbreak in Nunavut.\n\nA program to prevent latent from becoming active disease should\naccompany early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its\nprompt and complete treatment. Most cases of progression from latent\nTB to active tuberculosis occur within 2 to 12 months of initial\ninfection. Children and adolescents are especially at high risk for\nprogression to tuberculosis disease (with potential for disseminated\ndisease). Most children with latent TB have been recently infected\n(especially those younger than age 5 years), usually from exposure to\na person with active TB in their immediate environment, usually the\nhousehold. Children exposed to active TB must be evaluated and\ntreated for latent TB. TB control requires government commitment of\nfunds and personnel more than a single nurse in the field for such a\nlarge and remote region, even though she may be \"a really good nurse\".\n\nA map of Nunavut, Baffin Island, and the towns of Cape Dorset and\nIqaluit can be found at\n<http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/reference/provincesterritories/nunavut/referencemap_image_view>.\nNunavut can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map\nof Canada at <http://healthmap.org/r/0ccp>. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, children - UK: use of BCG vaccine 20100717.2386\n...................................ml/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Randell said they are also revising the TB manual for\nhealth care workers and developing a communications strategy. She\nsaid they have even offered taxi vouchers as incentives for people to\ncome for treatment. \"For the most part, most of the clients have been\nvery co-operative in helping us,\" she said.

Because drug\nresistance and HIV co-infection may require modification of the TB\ntreatment regimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf>), HIV\nstatus and drug resistance should be determined in each case, if not\ndone already, in the current outbreak in Nunavut.\n\nA program to prevent latent from becoming active disease should\naccompany early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its\nprompt and complete treatment. Most cases of progression from latent\nTB to active tuberculosis occur within 2 to 12 months of initial\ninfection. Children and adolescents are especially at high risk for\nprogression to tuberculosis disease (with potential for disseminated\ndisease). Most children with latent TB have been recently infected\n(especially those younger than age 5 years), usually from exposure to\na person with active TB in their immediate environment, usually the\nhousehold. Children exposed to active TB must be evaluated and\ntreated for latent TB. TB control requires government commitment of\nfunds and personnel more than a single nurse in the field for such a\nlarge and remote region, even though she may be \"a really good nurse\".\n\nA map of Nunavut, Baffin Island, and the towns of Cape Dorset and\nIqaluit can be found at\n<http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/reference/provincesterritories/nunavut/referencemap_image_view>.\nNunavut can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map\nof Canada at <http://healthmap.org/r/0ccp>. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, children - UK: use of BCG vaccine 20100717.2386\n...................................ml/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

From 1 Jan to 30 Sep 2010, 87 TB cases were diagnosed in\nNunavut, with 92 per cent of them [80 cases] in the Baffin region,\nsaid Elaine Randell, communicable disease consultant with Nunavut's\nDepartment of Health and Social Services. She added 40 of those cases\nwere in Iqaluit, 27 in Cape Dorset, and the rest in other\ncommunities. Randell also said 15 to 24-year-olds were hit the hardest.\n\nThe outbreak peaked in May [2010]. Only 3 TB cases were diagnosed in\nthe territory in September. \"There seems to be a downward trend,\nalthough with TB, it's probably too early to tell but we're hoping\nthat this is the beginning of a downward trend,\" she said. \"It would\nappear that Iqaluit and Cape Dorset both have their own strains. The\noutbreaks don't seem to be related.\"\n\nThis year's [2010] surge in cases already surpasses the previous\nrecord set in 2008, when 58 people were diagnosed with TB, an\ninfectious and potentially deadly disease that often attacks the\nlungs. \"Nunavut has all the elements for a perfect storm when it\ncomes to TB,\" she said. \"You have a high rate of infection among the\nInuit, which makes all the communities sort of at risk for outbreaks.\nYou also have the social determinants for health -- the poverty,\n[lack of] access to healthy foods, crowded housing conditions, those\nsorts of things.\" Those factors make the territory \"ripe for this\ntype of outbreak,\" she said.\n\nShe added they have traced anyone who might have been in contact with\nan infected person, sought other cases, and added staff to the\nbusiest areas. Randell said they are also revising the TB manual for\nhealth care workers and developing a communications strategy. She\nsaid they have even offered taxi vouchers as incentives for people to\ncome for treatment. \"For the most part, most of the clients have been\nvery co-operative in helping us,\" she said. In Cape Dorset, mayor\nCary Merritt, as the general manager of the local co-op, has provided\nfood vouchers to the co-op's restaurant as an incentive for people to\nfollow their treatment. \"It's helping making sure people come in to\nget their treatments on time,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not so worried because we have a really good nurse in place\nright now. She's been very proactive with making sure people come in\nand get their treatment. I believe she is really doing a good job\nbringing down the cases now and with the level of treatment, she's\nensuring it's happening. I think we will see a drastic reduction now.\"\n\n[Byline: Jeanne Gagnon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of\nWestern Europe; it comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and\nhas an estimated population in 2010 of about 33 000, mostly Inuit\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut>). The territorial capital\nIqaluit, which had a population in 2006 of 6184, is on Baffin Island,\nwhich had a population of 11 000 in 2007. Cape Dorset is a town\nlocated on Dorset Island at the southern tip of Baffin Island with a\npopulation in 2006 of 1236.\n\nThe TB incidence rate for the first 9 months of 2010 is thus 727 per\n100 000 in the Baffin region with 80 cases, 647 per 100 000 in\nIqaluit with 40 cases, and 2184 per 100 000 in Cape Dorset with 27\ncases, whereas the annual incidence rate for Canada as a whole has\nbeen reported to be less than 5 per 100 000\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tbpc-latb/itir-eng.php>).\n\nAboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the Inuit, First Nations, and\nMetis (indigenous First People of Canada who trace their descent to\nmixed European and First Nations parentage)\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada>). The\n2006 census counted a total Canadian Aboriginal population of 1 172\n790 (3.75 percent of the population), which includes 698 025 First\nNations (2.23 percent), 389 785 Metis (1.25 percent), and 50 480\nInuit (0.16 percent) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada>).\n\nSince the 1st contact with Europeans, the Canadian Aboriginals have\nhad a disproportionately high burden of TB disease. For example, high\nincidence rates for TB have been reported among Aboriginals, mainly\nFirst Nations, in Northern Manitoba: specifically 48.4 per 100 000\noverall, with rates as high as 496.3 per 100 000 in select\ncommunities (<http://www.skylarkmedicalclinic.com/TubercuosisinManitoba.htm>).\n\nIn 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/tbcbap-tbpac/special_report-eng.php>)\nreported that from 1991-1999, of 17 590 new active and relapsed TB\ncases, 3013 (17 percent) occurred among Canadian-born Aboriginals\n(which constitute only 3.75 percent of the population). Of the\nremaining cases, 4201 (24 percent) occurred in Canadian-born\nnon-Aboriginals and 10 281 (58 percent) occurred in foreign-born\nindividuals. Aboriginals with TB were younger (median 27 years) than\nforeign-born (median 39 years) and non-Aboriginals (median 59 years).\nIn this report, drug resistant strains of TB had not yet emerged as a\nsignificant problem in this population. Less than 2 percent of\nreported cases were resistant to one or more drugs. The extent of HIV\nco-infection could not be estimated using data from this surveillance\nsystem. (HIV status was known for only 2 percent of reported\nAboriginal cases.) In the 1990's, Aboriginal people were said to have\nan overall TB rate almost 4 times higher than the Canada-wide rate.\n\nMore recently, the situation has apparently worsened. In a news\nrelease in March 2010, the Inuit were reported to be \"the most at\nrisk of tuberculosis infection with a rate that is 186 times higher\nthan the non-aboriginal average. This is double what it was just 4\nyears ago\"\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\nThe high rates for TB in the Canadian Aboriginal population have been\nattributed to limited access to healthcare in remote regions,\nsubstandard housing, with whole families living in a single room,\nwidespread poverty, and malnutrition\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\n\nThe TB control plan described in the news release above seems\ninadequate for the situation. For example, the treatment plan in\nNunavut relies on the patients self-administering medication. Because\nof the frequency of non-adherence to TB treatment regimens in all\npopulations, directly observed therapy (DOTS) is the internationally\nrecommended strategy for TB case management. DOTS requires an\nindependent observer watching patients swallow each dose of their\nanti-TB therapy. The independent observer is not necessarily a\nhealthcare worker; the person could be, for example, a tribal elder\nor similar senior person within that community. Because drug\nresistance and HIV co-infection may require modification of the TB\ntreatment regimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf>), HIV\nstatus and drug resistance should be determined in each case, if not\ndone already, in the current outbreak in Nunavut.\n\nA program to prevent latent from becoming active disease should\naccompany early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its\nprompt and complete treatment.

From 1 Jan to 30 Sep 2010, 87 TB cases were diagnosed in\nNunavut, with 92 per cent of them [80 cases] in the Baffin region,\nsaid Elaine Randell, communicable disease consultant with Nunavut's\nDepartment of Health and Social Services. She added 40 of those cases\nwere in Iqaluit, 27 in Cape Dorset, and the rest in other\ncommunities. Randell also said 15 to 24-year-olds were hit the hardest.\n\nThe outbreak peaked in May [2010]. Only 3 TB cases were diagnosed in\nthe territory in September. \"There seems to be a downward trend,\nalthough with TB, it's probably too early to tell but we're hoping\nthat this is the beginning of a downward trend,\" she said. \"It would\nappear that Iqaluit and Cape Dorset both have their own strains. The\noutbreaks don't seem to be related.\"\n\nThis year's [2010] surge in cases already surpasses the previous\nrecord set in 2008, when 58 people were diagnosed with TB, an\ninfectious and potentially deadly disease that often attacks the\nlungs. \"Nunavut has all the elements for a perfect storm when it\ncomes to TB,\" she said. \"You have a high rate of infection among the\nInuit, which makes all the communities sort of at risk for outbreaks.\nYou also have the social determinants for health -- the poverty,\n[lack of] access to healthy foods, crowded housing conditions, those\nsorts of things.\" Those factors make the territory \"ripe for this\ntype of outbreak,\" she said.\n\nShe added they have traced anyone who might have been in contact with\nan infected person, sought other cases, and added staff to the\nbusiest areas. Randell said they are also revising the TB manual for\nhealth care workers and developing a communications strategy. She\nsaid they have even offered taxi vouchers as incentives for people to\ncome for treatment. \"For the most part, most of the clients have been\nvery co-operative in helping us,\" she said. In Cape Dorset, mayor\nCary Merritt, as the general manager of the local co-op, has provided\nfood vouchers to the co-op's restaurant as an incentive for people to\nfollow their treatment. \"It's helping making sure people come in to\nget their treatments on time,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not so worried because we have a really good nurse in place\nright now. She's been very proactive with making sure people come in\nand get their treatment. I believe she is really doing a good job\nbringing down the cases now and with the level of treatment, she's\nensuring it's happening. I think we will see a drastic reduction now.\"\n\n[Byline: Jeanne Gagnon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of\nWestern Europe; it comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and\nhas an estimated population in 2010 of about 33 000, mostly Inuit\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut>). The territorial capital\nIqaluit, which had a population in 2006 of 6184, is on Baffin Island,\nwhich had a population of 11 000 in 2007. Cape Dorset is a town\nlocated on Dorset Island at the southern tip of Baffin Island with a\npopulation in 2006 of 1236.\n\nThe TB incidence rate for the first 9 months of 2010 is thus 727 per\n100 000 in the Baffin region with 80 cases, 647 per 100 000 in\nIqaluit with 40 cases, and 2184 per 100 000 in Cape Dorset with 27\ncases, whereas the annual incidence rate for Canada as a whole has\nbeen reported to be less than 5 per 100 000\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tbpc-latb/itir-eng.php>).\n\nAboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the Inuit, First Nations, and\nMetis (indigenous First People of Canada who trace their descent to\nmixed European and First Nations parentage)\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada>). The\n2006 census counted a total Canadian Aboriginal population of 1 172\n790 (3.75 percent of the population), which includes 698 025 First\nNations (2.23 percent), 389 785 Metis (1.25 percent), and 50 480\nInuit (0.16 percent) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada>).\n\nSince the 1st contact with Europeans, the Canadian Aboriginals have\nhad a disproportionately high burden of TB disease. For example, high\nincidence rates for TB have been reported among Aboriginals, mainly\nFirst Nations, in Northern Manitoba: specifically 48.4 per 100 000\noverall, with rates as high as 496.3 per 100 000 in select\ncommunities (<http://www.skylarkmedicalclinic.com/TubercuosisinManitoba.htm>).\n\nIn 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada\n(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/tbcbap-tbpac/special_report-eng.php>)\nreported that from 1991-1999, of 17 590 new active and relapsed TB\ncases, 3013 (17 percent) occurred among Canadian-born Aboriginals\n(which constitute only 3.75 percent of the population). Of the\nremaining cases, 4201 (24 percent) occurred in Canadian-born\nnon-Aboriginals and 10 281 (58 percent) occurred in foreign-born\nindividuals. Aboriginals with TB were younger (median 27 years) than\nforeign-born (median 39 years) and non-Aboriginals (median 59 years).\nIn this report, drug resistant strains of TB had not yet emerged as a\nsignificant problem in this population. Less than 2 percent of\nreported cases were resistant to one or more drugs. The extent of HIV\nco-infection could not be estimated using data from this surveillance\nsystem. (HIV status was known for only 2 percent of reported\nAboriginal cases.) In the 1990's, Aboriginal people were said to have\nan overall TB rate almost 4 times higher than the Canada-wide rate.\n\nMore recently, the situation has apparently worsened. In a news\nrelease in March 2010, the Inuit were reported to be \"the most at\nrisk of tuberculosis infection with a rate that is 186 times higher\nthan the non-aboriginal average. This is double what it was just 4\nyears ago\"\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\nThe high rates for TB in the Canadian Aboriginal population have been\nattributed to limited access to healthcare in remote regions,\nsubstandard housing, with whole families living in a single room,\nwidespread poverty, and malnutrition\n(<http://www.suite101.com/content/tb-epidemic-among-canadas-native-people-a211908#ixzz11jIy6OW1>).\n\nThe TB control plan described in the news release above seems\ninadequate for the situation. For example, the treatment plan in\nNunavut relies on the patients self-administering medication. Because\nof the frequency of non-adherence to TB treatment regimens in all\npopulations, directly observed therapy (DOTS) is the internationally\nrecommended strategy for TB case management. DOTS requires an\nindependent observer watching patients swallow each dose of their\nanti-TB therapy. The independent observer is not necessarily a\nhealthcare worker; the person could be, for example, a tribal elder\nor similar senior person within that community. Because drug\nresistance and HIV co-infection may require modification of the TB\ntreatment regimens (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf>), HIV\nstatus and drug resistance should be determined in each case, if not\ndone already, in the current outbreak in Nunavut.\n\nA program to prevent latent from becoming active disease should\naccompany early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its\nprompt and complete treatment. Most cases of progression from latent\nTB to active tuberculosis occur within 2 to 12 months of initial\ninfection. Children and adolescents are especially at high risk for\nprogression to tuberculosis disease (with potential for disseminated\ndisease). Most children with latent TB have been recently infected\n(especially those younger than age 5 years), usually from exposure to\na person with active TB in their immediate environment, usually the\nhousehold. Children exposed to active TB must be evaluated and\ntreated for latent TB. TB control requires government commitment of\nfunds and personnel more than a single nurse in the field for such a\nlarge and remote region, even though she may be \"a really good nurse\".\n\nA map of Nunavut, Baffin Island, and the towns of Cape Dorset and\nIqaluit can be found at\n<http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/reference/provincesterritories/nunavut/referencemap_image_view>.\nNunavut can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map\nof Canada at <http://healthmap.org/r/0ccp>. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, children - UK: use of BCG vaccine 20100717.2386\n...................................ml/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Bovine tuberculosis, also known as cattle TB, is\nan infectious form of tuberculosis as it infects most warm-blooded\nanimals, including humans. It can manifest in livestock as a chronic,\ndebilitating disease, and it may take years to develop bovine\ntuberculosis lesions in the lungs.\n\nAirborne exposure from coughing and sneezing is considered to be the\nmost frequent way in which bovine tuberculosis is spread, but it can\nalso occur through consumption of contaminated water, feed, or\nunpasteurized milk.\n\nFor more information about the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, visit\n<http://www.agri.ohio.gov>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. While\nthere are other _Mycobacterium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_\nare among the most important, as these tend to move between animals and people.\n\nDisease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take\nmonths to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only\nreplicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those\nwhich can cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can\ninfect a human or an animal, often the individual does not know that\nhe has been infected. In humans, those infected but without active\ndisease can be treated to prevent disease from occurring. To prevent\nother animals from being infected, a diseased animal must be culled\nfrom the herd.\n\nThe disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also\nspread to other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission\nis the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and\nuninfected animals. This can be achieved through nose-to-nose contact\nor by the inhalation of aerosol droplets that have been exhaled by an\ninfected animal. Animals may also become infected with _M. bovis_ by\ningesting the bacteria. This could occur by ingesting feeds that have\nbeen contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other infected animals.\nCarnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating infected carcasses.\n\nVarious factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread\nwithin a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the\norganism, as well as the number of susceptible animals present within\na herd can have an impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For\nexample, the more animals within a herd shedding _M. bovis_, the\ngreater the chance of an uninfected animal coming into contact with\nan infected animal. The animal density of a herd also influences the\nefficiency of _M. bovis_ transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_\namong animals housed in confinement facilities may be greater because\nof close contact. Cattle infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in\ntheir feces, urine, and milk, but these are felt to be a minor source\nof bacterial transmission.\n\nEnvironmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the\nspread of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is\nprimarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of\nsurvival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging\nfrom 54-75 deg F (12-24 deg C). Under laboratory conditions, _M.\nbovis_ has been isolated for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at\n75 deg F (24 deg C) and 14 weeks from various feeds kept at 32 deg F\n(0 deg C). Under field conditions, however, it is difficult to\nisolate _M. bovis_ from pastures grazed by animals known to be\ninfected with bovine TB.\n\nSadly, this disease still keeps popping up in the animal herds.\nResearchers need to find a more reliable test. While the Bovigam [an\nin vitro laboratory test for the diagnosis of bovine TB in cattle,\nsheep, goats, buffalo, bison, and other bovidae] has promise, it is\nnot an end-all to testing.\n\nParts of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.michigan.gov/emergingdiseases/0,1607,7-186-25804-75601--,00.html>.\n- Mod.TG]\n\n[The state of Ohio can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive\nmap at <http://healthmap.org/r/01Ja>.

While\nthere are other _Mycobacterium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_\nare among the most important, as these tend to move between animals and people.\n\nDisease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take\nmonths to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only\nreplicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those\nwhich can cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can\ninfect a human or an animal, often the individual does not know that\nhe has been infected. In humans, those infected but without active\ndisease can be treated to prevent disease from occurring. To prevent\nother animals from being infected, a diseased animal must be culled\nfrom the herd.\n\nThe disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also\nspread to other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission\nis the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and\nuninfected animals. This can be achieved through nose-to-nose contact\nor by the inhalation of aerosol droplets that have been exhaled by an\ninfected animal. Animals may also become infected with _M. bovis_ by\ningesting the bacteria. This could occur by ingesting feeds that have\nbeen contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other infected animals.\nCarnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating infected carcasses.\n\nVarious factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread\nwithin a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the\norganism, as well as the number of susceptible animals present within\na herd can have an impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For\nexample, the more animals within a herd shedding _M. bovis_, the\ngreater the chance of an uninfected animal coming into contact with\nan infected animal. The animal density of a herd also influences the\nefficiency of _M. bovis_ transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_\namong animals housed in confinement facilities may be greater because\nof close contact. Cattle infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in\ntheir feces, urine, and milk, but these are felt to be a minor source\nof bacterial transmission.\n\nEnvironmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the\nspread of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is\nprimarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of\nsurvival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging\nfrom 54-75 deg F (12-24 deg C).

There\nis no known human illness associated with this occurrence.\n\nThe herd was found positive after routine tuberculosis testing by the\ndepartment. The herd was depopulated, and the department is currently\nconducting a trace-in and trace-out investigation to determine if\nother livestock may be affected.\n\n\"We are currently working with our state and federal partners on this\nmatter to take the necessary steps to identify the origin of the\naffected cattle,\" said Boggs. \"This is yet another example of how the\nOhio Department of Agriculture works daily to assure the safety of\nOhio consumers and livestock.\"\n\nTuberculosis is a disease caused by bacteria which affect the\nrespiratory system. Bovine tuberculosis, also known as cattle TB, is\nan infectious form of tuberculosis as it infects most warm-blooded\nanimals, including humans. It can manifest in livestock as a chronic,\ndebilitating disease, and it may take years to develop bovine\ntuberculosis lesions in the lungs.\n\nAirborne exposure from coughing and sneezing is considered to be the\nmost frequent way in which bovine tuberculosis is spread, but it can\nalso occur through consumption of contaminated water, feed, or\nunpasteurized milk.\n\nFor more information about the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, visit\n<http://www.agri.ohio.gov>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. While\nthere are other _Mycobacterium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_\nare among the most important, as these tend to move between animals and people.\n\nDisease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take\nmonths to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only\nreplicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those\nwhich can cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can\ninfect a human or an animal, often the individual does not know that\nhe has been infected. In humans, those infected but without active\ndisease can be treated to prevent disease from occurring. To prevent\nother animals from being infected, a diseased animal must be culled\nfrom the herd.\n\nThe disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also\nspread to other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission\nis the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and\nuninfected animals. This can be achieved through nose-to-nose contact\nor by the inhalation of aerosol droplets that have been exhaled by an\ninfected animal. Animals may also become infected with _M. bovis_ by\ningesting the bacteria. This could occur by ingesting feeds that have\nbeen contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other infected animals.\nCarnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating infected carcasses.\n\nVarious factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread\nwithin a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the\norganism, as well as the number of susceptible animals present within\na herd can have an impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For\nexample, the more animals within a herd shedding _M. bovis_, the\ngreater the chance of an uninfected animal coming into contact with\nan infected animal. The animal density of a herd also influences the\nefficiency of _M. bovis_ transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_\namong animals housed in confinement facilities may be greater because\nof close contact. Cattle infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in\ntheir feces, urine, and milk, but these are felt to be a minor source\nof bacterial transmission.\n\nEnvironmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the\nspread of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is\nprimarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of\nsurvival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging\nfrom 54-75 deg F (12-24 deg C). Under laboratory conditions, _M.\nbovis_ has been isolated for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at\n75 deg F (24 deg C) and 14 weeks from various feeds kept at 32 deg F\n(0 deg C). Under field conditions, however, it is difficult to\nisolate _M. bovis_ from pastures grazed by animals known to be\ninfected with bovine TB.\n\nSadly, this disease still keeps popping up in the animal herds.\nResearchers need to find a more reliable test. While the Bovigam [an\nin vitro laboratory test for the diagnosis of bovine TB in cattle,\nsheep, goats, buffalo, bison, and other bovidae] has promise, it is\nnot an end-all to testing.\n\nParts of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.michigan.gov/emergingdiseases/0,1607,7-186-25804-75601--,00.html>.\n- Mod.TG]\n\n[The state of Ohio can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive\nmap at <http://healthmap.org/r/01Ja>.

The\npaper warned of a 'low, but ongoing, public health risk' where bTB is\nprevalent in cattle and badgers.\n\nAccording to DEFRA the number of cases of human infection with bTB\nwas 'low and stable' and accounted for less than 1 percent of all\nconfirmed cases of TB in humans.\n\n[Byline: William Surman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nH Jones and Sons\n<ajones@hjones-sons.co.uk>\n\n[_Mycobacterium bovis_ (Mb) is a member of the \"_Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ complex,\" along with other genetically closely related\nspecies: _ Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), the BCG bacillus, _M.\nafricanum_, _M. caprae_, _M. microti_, and M. canetti. Mtb is the\nusual cause of tuberculosis in humans and Mb is the usual cause of\nbovine tuberculosis. Although the disease caused by Mb is commonly\ncalled bovine tuberculosis, Mb has a broad host range that includes\nhumans, cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, badgers, foxes, marsupials,\nrabbits, sheep, horses, and deer. BCG is the attenuated bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin vaccine strain derived from a virulent Mb strain that\nhas been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and increasingly as\ncancer immunotherapy. _M. microti_ has been reported to infect small\nrodents like voles and more recently also humans. _M. canettii_ and\n_M. africanum_ both cause human tuberculosis, mainly in Africa.\n\nHumans are generally infected with Mb by eating or drinking\ncontaminated, unpasteurized (raw) milk products from areas where Mb\nis present in cattle. Mb can also be spread through the air when a\nperson with the disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. Mb is\ninherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an\nessential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to\ntreat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation\nof Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as\nepidemiologically. The standard gene probe used in clinical\nmicrobiology labs just identifies the \"_M. tuberculosis_ complex\". Mb\ncan be distinguished rapidly from Mtb by spoligotyping (spacer\noligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based\namplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome. Other tests,\nsuch as growth in selective media, specific biochemical reactions,\nand resistance to pyrazinamide, are more time consuming.\n\nHuman infection caused by Mb has been mostly, but not completely,\neradicated in the developed world by the use of pasteurization of\nmilk and culling of cattle shown positive on skin testing, which was\nstarted in about 1917 in the USA. Mb infection in humans continues to\nbe reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants who acquired the\ninfection in their countries of origin where Mb infection remains\nendemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of\ningesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of Mb-infected\ncows and smuggled across the Mexico-US border (see Levison ME.\n_Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis\nRep 2008, 10:444-446). In the U.K. in recent years, bovine TB in\ncattle has been on the rise, a trend that some blame on badgers\nspreading the infection.\n\nAs stated in the news release above, last year a woman from Cornwall,\nEngland was believed to have developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to\nMb that was acquired either from cattle while working as a veterinary\nnurse or from badgers in her garden; her dog was also infected with\nMb [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK:\n(England) (02) 20080927.3054]. To cause her pulmonary tuberculosis,\nshe would have had to inhale an infectious aerosol of Mb. As stated\nin the ProMED moderator's comments at the time, of the 3 possible\nsources -- cattle, her dog, or the badgers in her garden -- the\nbadgers would seem to be the least likely source, unless grass or\nsoil contaminated by the badgers was aersolized, for example, by\nmowing.

Mtb is the\nusual cause of tuberculosis in humans and Mb is the usual cause of\nbovine tuberculosis. Although the disease caused by Mb is commonly\ncalled bovine tuberculosis, Mb has a broad host range that includes\nhumans, cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, badgers, foxes, marsupials,\nrabbits, sheep, horses, and deer. BCG is the attenuated bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin vaccine strain derived from a virulent Mb strain that\nhas been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and increasingly as\ncancer immunotherapy. _M. microti_ has been reported to infect small\nrodents like voles and more recently also humans. _M. canettii_ and\n_M. africanum_ both cause human tuberculosis, mainly in Africa.\n\nHumans are generally infected with Mb by eating or drinking\ncontaminated, unpasteurized (raw) milk products from areas where Mb\nis present in cattle. Mb can also be spread through the air when a\nperson with the disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. Mb is\ninherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an\nessential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to\ntreat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation\nof Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as\nepidemiologically. The standard gene probe used in clinical\nmicrobiology labs just identifies the \"_M. tuberculosis_ complex\". Mb\ncan be distinguished rapidly from Mtb by spoligotyping (spacer\noligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based\namplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome. Other tests,\nsuch as growth in selective media, specific biochemical reactions,\nand resistance to pyrazinamide, are more time consuming.\n\nHuman infection caused by Mb has been mostly, but not completely,\neradicated in the developed world by the use of pasteurization of\nmilk and culling of cattle shown positive on skin testing, which was\nstarted in about 1917 in the USA. Mb infection in humans continues to\nbe reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants who acquired the\ninfection in their countries of origin where Mb infection remains\nendemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of\ningesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of Mb-infected\ncows and smuggled across the Mexico-US border (see Levison ME.\n_Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen.

In the U.K. in recent years, bovine TB in\ncattle has been on the rise, a trend that some blame on badgers\nspreading the infection.\n\nAs stated in the news release above, last year a woman from Cornwall,\nEngland was believed to have developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to\nMb that was acquired either from cattle while working as a veterinary\nnurse or from badgers in her garden; her dog was also infected with\nMb [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK:\n(England) (02) 20080927.3054]. To cause her pulmonary tuberculosis,\nshe would have had to inhale an infectious aerosol of Mb. As stated\nin the ProMED moderator's comments at the time, of the 3 possible\nsources -- cattle, her dog, or the badgers in her garden -- the\nbadgers would seem to be the least likely source, unless grass or\nsoil contaminated by the badgers was aersolized, for example, by\nmowing.

BCG is the attenuated bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin vaccine strain derived from a virulent Mb strain that\nhas been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and increasingly as\ncancer immunotherapy. _M. microti_ has been reported to infect small\nrodents like voles and more recently also humans. _M. canettii_ and\n_M. africanum_ both cause human tuberculosis, mainly in Africa.\n\nHumans are generally infected with Mb by eating or drinking\ncontaminated, unpasteurized (raw) milk products from areas where Mb\nis present in cattle. Mb can also be spread through the air when a\nperson with the disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. Mb is\ninherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an\nessential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to\ntreat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation\nof Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as\nepidemiologically. The standard gene probe used in clinical\nmicrobiology labs just identifies the \"_M. tuberculosis_ complex\". Mb\ncan be distinguished rapidly from Mtb by spoligotyping (spacer\noligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based\namplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome. Other tests,\nsuch as growth in selective media, specific biochemical reactions,\nand resistance to pyrazinamide, are more time consuming.\n\nHuman infection caused by Mb has been mostly, but not completely,\neradicated in the developed world by the use of pasteurization of\nmilk and culling of cattle shown positive on skin testing, which was\nstarted in about 1917 in the USA. Mb infection in humans continues to\nbe reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants who acquired the\ninfection in their countries of origin where Mb infection remains\nendemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of\ningesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of Mb-infected\ncows and smuggled across the Mexico-US border (see Levison ME.\n_Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis\nRep 2008, 10:444-446). In the U.K. in recent years, bovine TB in\ncattle has been on the rise, a trend that some blame on badgers\nspreading the infection.\n\nAs stated in the news release above, last year a woman from Cornwall,\nEngland was believed to have developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to\nMb that was acquired either from cattle while working as a veterinary\nnurse or from badgers in her garden; her dog was also infected with\nMb [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK:\n(England) (02) 20080927.3054]. To cause her pulmonary tuberculosis,\nshe would have had to inhale an infectious aerosol of Mb. As stated\nin the ProMED moderator's comments at the time, of the 3 possible\nsources -- cattle, her dog, or the badgers in her garden -- the\nbadgers would seem to be the least likely source, unless grass or\nsoil contaminated by the badgers was aersolized, for example, by\nmowing. It is doubtful that she \"inhaled\" aerosolized urine from\ninfected badgers after touching grass or soil.

Around 30 staff at the\nFood and Environment Research Agency (FERA) in Gloucestershire are\nalso being tested for the disease.\n\nThe staff are all involved in looking into the spread of bovine TB\nfor DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). Dr\nAlison Wilson, head of executive support at FERA, confirmed the\nhealth of a member of staff was under investigation. She said: \"We\ncan confirm that a member of staff is being investigated for a\nsuspected mycobacterial infection. Some of FERA's staff work on\nlong-term wildlife research projects looking at the relationship\nbetween badgers and cattle in the spread of bovine TB. FERA is\ntherefore treating the case seriously, as it may represent infection\nby _Mycobacterium bovis_, the organism which causes bovine TB.\" She\nalso confirmed 30 staff were being tested for the disease.\n\nDr Wilson said: \"This is the 1st instance of suspected bovine TB\namong staff at the agency, which has been working in this research\narea for more than 30 years. \"The risk of contracting the disease\nfrom this type of work remains very low. The risk to the health of\nthe public remains very low.\" Last year [2008] a former veterinary\nnurse, from Cornwall, and her dog contracted bTB [bovine\ntuberculosis] [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human,\ncanine - UK: (England) (02) 20080927.3054]. A paper on the case,\npublished in medical journal Thorax, concluded that the woman could\nhave been infected by cattle while working as a veterinary nurse or\nbadgers 'both on her property and as part of her previous work.' The\npaper warned of a 'low, but ongoing, public health risk' where bTB is\nprevalent in cattle and badgers.\n\nAccording to DEFRA the number of cases of human infection with bTB\nwas 'low and stable' and accounted for less than 1 percent of all\nconfirmed cases of TB in humans.\n\n[Byline: William Surman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nH Jones and Sons\n<ajones@hjones-sons.co.uk>\n\n[_Mycobacterium bovis_ (Mb) is a member of the \"_Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ complex,\" along with other genetically closely related\nspecies: _ Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), the BCG bacillus, _M.\nafricanum_, _M. caprae_, _M. microti_, and M. canetti. Mtb is the\nusual cause of tuberculosis in humans and Mb is the usual cause of\nbovine tuberculosis. Although the disease caused by Mb is commonly\ncalled bovine tuberculosis, Mb has a broad host range that includes\nhumans, cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, badgers, foxes, marsupials,\nrabbits, sheep, horses, and deer. BCG is the attenuated bacillus\nCalmette-Guerin vaccine strain derived from a virulent Mb strain that\nhas been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and increasingly as\ncancer immunotherapy. _M. microti_ has been reported to infect small\nrodents like voles and more recently also humans. _M. canettii_ and\n_M. africanum_ both cause human tuberculosis, mainly in Africa.\n\nHumans are generally infected with Mb by eating or drinking\ncontaminated, unpasteurized (raw) milk products from areas where Mb\nis present in cattle. Mb can also be spread through the air when a\nperson with the disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. Mb is\ninherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an\nessential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to\ntreat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation\nof Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as\nepidemiologically. The standard gene probe used in clinical\nmicrobiology labs just identifies the \"_M. tuberculosis_ complex\". Mb\ncan be distinguished rapidly from Mtb by spoligotyping (spacer\noligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based\namplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome. Other tests,\nsuch as growth in selective media, specific biochemical reactions,\nand resistance to pyrazinamide, are more time consuming.\n\nHuman infection caused by Mb has been mostly, but not completely,\neradicated in the developed world by the use of pasteurization of\nmilk and culling of cattle shown positive on skin testing, which was\nstarted in about 1917 in the USA. Mb infection in humans continues to\nbe reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants who acquired the\ninfection in their countries of origin where Mb infection remains\nendemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of\ningesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of Mb-infected\ncows and smuggled across the Mexico-US border (see Levison ME.\n_Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis\nRep 2008, 10:444-446). In the U.K. in recent years, bovine TB in\ncattle has been on the rise, a trend that some blame on badgers\nspreading the infection.\n\nAs stated in the news release above, last year a woman from Cornwall,\nEngland was believed to have developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to\nMb that was acquired either from cattle while working as a veterinary\nnurse or from badgers in her garden; her dog was also infected with\nMb [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK:\n(England) (02) 20080927.3054]. To cause her pulmonary tuberculosis,\nshe would have had to inhale an infectious aerosol of Mb. As stated\nin the ProMED moderator's comments at the time, of the 3 possible\nsources -- cattle, her dog, or the badgers in her garden -- the\nbadgers would seem to be the least likely source, unless grass or\nsoil contaminated by the badgers was aersolized, for example, by\nmowing. It is doubtful that she \"inhaled\" aerosolized urine from\ninfected badgers after touching grass or soil. It seems she more\nlikely had exposure to aerosolized respiratory secretions of infected\ncattle she may have taken care of or her dog.

No\nother deer removed this winter [2008-09] showed similar signs of\ninfection. \"We fully expected that the deer population was carrying\nsome of this, so to find one is a good sign,\" Kinney said.\n\nThe older deer makes state officials believe that bovine TB among\ndeer may be confined to a certain age class, since the infected deer\nfound since testing began in 2005 have been born in 2005 or earlier.\n\n\"It was an older deer that was found,\" Kinney said. \"That's great,\nand it means that we need to continue that diligence to seek it out.\nI don't expect we're going to have any problems, but that's why we're\nstaying on high alert on it.\"\n\nLast year [208], the US Department of Agriculture allowed Minnesota a\nsplit-state status, meaning that outside a bovine TB management area\nin northwest Beltrami County and Roseau County, the state remains TB-free.\n\nCattle sold within the bovine TB management area must undergo strict\ntesting regimes before being sold or transported across state lines.\n\nCattle are believed to contract bovine TB from infected free-ranging\ndeer, so the DNR [Department of Natural Resources] has been working\nwith USDA sharpshooters during the winter to cull the deer herd in that area.\n\nThe DNR has also conducted surveillance for TB in hunter-harvested\ndeer within a 15-mile [24 km] radius of the once-infected farms every\nfall since 2005. To date, more than 6000 deer taken by hunters and\nsharp-shooters have been tested.\n\n\"The older ages of infected deer, the lack of infection in younger\ndeer, and the close proximity of infected deer suggest the disease is\nnot efficiently spreading in the deer population,\" Michelle\nCarstensen, DNR wildlife health program coordinator, said last month\n[May 2009].\n\nDNR sampled 1246 deer taken in the bovine TB surveillance zone during\nthe fall 2008 hunt. Spring sharp-shooting efforts, that began in\nMarch and concluded 30 Apr [2009], have resulted in an additional 738\ndeer being removed near previously infected cattle operations inside\nthe management zone.\n\nDNR will continue monitoring for the disease through sampling of\nhunter-harvested deer, Carstensen said. Hunter-harvested surveillance\nwill be conducted within the larger bovine TB surveillance zone in\nfall 2009, with a sampling goal of 1800 deer. Surveillance will\ncontinue every year until no positive animals are detected for 5\nconsecutive years, she said.\n\nThe 2008 Legislature, led by Sen. Rod Skoe, DFL-Clearbrook, put in\nplace the bovine TB management zone and provided buyouts of herds\nthat may be infected and ordered fencing around remaining herds to\nkeep out deer.\n\nThe Agriculture Department's bovine TB czar is Joe Martin, appointed\nby Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \"He's done just a great job shepherding this\nthrough and being sure that producers are being taken care of,\" said\nKinney. \"Funding-wise, we've had a great partnership, especially with\nthe legislative folks up here. They understand the issue, they've\nbeen working very closely hand-in-hand with Joe and the DNR to be\nsure we've got that balance.\"\n\n\"This should not delay Minnesota's goal of regaining TB-Free Status,\"\nMartin said last month [May 2009] of the new deer discovery. \"We have\nbeen in contact with USDA and they have assured us this finding in\nthe deer will not impact cattle movements or the state's TB status.\"\n\nThe state's status is only impacted by finding additional TB-positive\ncattle herds. The last known infected herd was depopulated earlier\nthis year [2009] as part of the state's buyout program. There are no\nother active cattle investigations ongoing at this time, Martin said.\n\nThe buyout of herds is complete, Kinney said. \"Money-wise this coming\nyear it's going to be continuing to provide some education and\nmanagement opportunities for as long as these folks are going to need\nto be out, be sure that we're monitoring that deer population so that\nwe can get the status back as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe issue continues to be a priority of the Minnesota Farm Bureau\nFederation, which lobbied last year [2008] for the special management\nzone and funding for cattle buyouts. \"Bovine TB is still a priority\nfor us in Farm Bureau,\" Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap\nsaid in a recent interview. \"We need to do everything and anything we\ncan to eradicate that, both in the cattle and the deer herds. So\nwe'll watch that very closely.\"\n\nMinnesota state agencies and USDA have entered into a productive\npartnership in an effort to eradicate bovine TB, Kinney said. \"We\nhave a very good partnership, and I have say that's to the fact that\nCommissioner (Gene) Hugoson has served so long in a leadership role,\"\nshe said. \"That consistency has been extremely important, not only\nfor Minnesota but for APHIS and the other divisions. He is recognized\nnationally as a leader and has great insight.\" USDA's Animal and\nPublic Health Information System establishes threat levels for animal\ndiseases, and determines levels of bovine TB classifications.\n\nKinney also credited US House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson,\nDFL-7th District, in whose district the bovine TB management zone\nlies. \"He just does a tremendous job as an advocate for agriculture,\nand his role as chairman of the House Ag Committee certainly helped\nMinnesota come forward,\" Kinney said. \"We've got great dialogue with him.\"\n\n[Byline: Brad Swenson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland\n\n[Minnesota has had a long battle with tuberculosis, both in bovines\nand in cervids.

No\nother deer removed this winter [2008-09] showed similar signs of\ninfection. \"We fully expected that the deer population was carrying\nsome of this, so to find one is a good sign,\" Kinney said.\n\nThe older deer makes state officials believe that bovine TB among\ndeer may be confined to a certain age class, since the infected deer\nfound since testing began in 2005 have been born in 2005 or earlier.\n\n\"It was an older deer that was found,\" Kinney said. \"That's great,\nand it means that we need to continue that diligence to seek it out.\nI don't expect we're going to have any problems, but that's why we're\nstaying on high alert on it.\"\n\nLast year [208], the US Department of Agriculture allowed Minnesota a\nsplit-state status, meaning that outside a bovine TB management area\nin northwest Beltrami County and Roseau County, the state remains TB-free.\n\nCattle sold within the bovine TB management area must undergo strict\ntesting regimes before being sold or transported across state lines.\n\nCattle are believed to contract bovine TB from infected free-ranging\ndeer, so the DNR [Department of Natural Resources] has been working\nwith USDA sharpshooters during the winter to cull the deer herd in that area.\n\nThe DNR has also conducted surveillance for TB in hunter-harvested\ndeer within a 15-mile [24 km] radius of the once-infected farms every\nfall since 2005. To date, more than 6000 deer taken by hunters and\nsharp-shooters have been tested.\n\n\"The older ages of infected deer, the lack of infection in younger\ndeer, and the close proximity of infected deer suggest the disease is\nnot efficiently spreading in the deer population,\" Michelle\nCarstensen, DNR wildlife health program coordinator, said last month\n[May 2009].\n\nDNR sampled 1246 deer taken in the bovine TB surveillance zone during\nthe fall 2008 hunt. Spring sharp-shooting efforts, that began in\nMarch and concluded 30 Apr [2009], have resulted in an additional 738\ndeer being removed near previously infected cattle operations inside\nthe management zone.\n\nDNR will continue monitoring for the disease through sampling of\nhunter-harvested deer, Carstensen said. Hunter-harvested surveillance\nwill be conducted within the larger bovine TB surveillance zone in\nfall 2009, with a sampling goal of 1800 deer. Surveillance will\ncontinue every year until no positive animals are detected for 5\nconsecutive years, she said.\n\nThe 2008 Legislature, led by Sen. Rod Skoe, DFL-Clearbrook, put in\nplace the bovine TB management zone and provided buyouts of herds\nthat may be infected and ordered fencing around remaining herds to\nkeep out deer.\n\nThe Agriculture Department's bovine TB czar is Joe Martin, appointed\nby Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \"He's done just a great job shepherding this\nthrough and being sure that producers are being taken care of,\" said\nKinney. \"Funding-wise, we've had a great partnership, especially with\nthe legislative folks up here. They understand the issue, they've\nbeen working very closely hand-in-hand with Joe and the DNR to be\nsure we've got that balance.\"\n\n\"This should not delay Minnesota's goal of regaining TB-Free Status,\"\nMartin said last month [May 2009] of the new deer discovery. \"We have\nbeen in contact with USDA and they have assured us this finding in\nthe deer will not impact cattle movements or the state's TB status.\"\n\nThe state's status is only impacted by finding additional TB-positive\ncattle herds. The last known infected herd was depopulated earlier\nthis year [2009] as part of the state's buyout program. There are no\nother active cattle investigations ongoing at this time, Martin said.\n\nThe buyout of herds is complete, Kinney said. \"Money-wise this coming\nyear it's going to be continuing to provide some education and\nmanagement opportunities for as long as these folks are going to need\nto be out, be sure that we're monitoring that deer population so that\nwe can get the status back as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe issue continues to be a priority of the Minnesota Farm Bureau\nFederation, which lobbied last year [2008] for the special management\nzone and funding for cattle buyouts. \"Bovine TB is still a priority\nfor us in Farm Bureau,\" Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap\nsaid in a recent interview. \"We need to do everything and anything we\ncan to eradicate that, both in the cattle and the deer herds. So\nwe'll watch that very closely.\"\n\nMinnesota state agencies and USDA have entered into a productive\npartnership in an effort to eradicate bovine TB, Kinney said. \"We\nhave a very good partnership, and I have say that's to the fact that\nCommissioner (Gene) Hugoson has served so long in a leadership role,\"\nshe said. \"That consistency has been extremely important, not only\nfor Minnesota but for APHIS and the other divisions. He is recognized\nnationally as a leader and has great insight.\" USDA's Animal and\nPublic Health Information System establishes threat levels for animal\ndiseases, and determines levels of bovine TB classifications.\n\nKinney also credited US House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson,\nDFL-7th District, in whose district the bovine TB management zone\nlies. \"He just does a tremendous job as an advocate for agriculture,\nand his role as chairman of the House Ag Committee certainly helped\nMinnesota come forward,\" Kinney said. \"We've got great dialogue with him.\"\n\n[Byline: Brad Swenson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland\n\n[Minnesota has had a long battle with tuberculosis, both in bovines\nand in cervids.

Spring sharp-shooting efforts, that began in\nMarch and concluded 30 Apr [2009], have resulted in an additional 738\ndeer being removed near previously infected cattle operations inside\nthe management zone.\n\nDNR will continue monitoring for the disease through sampling of\nhunter-harvested deer, Carstensen said. Hunter-harvested surveillance\nwill be conducted within the larger bovine TB surveillance zone in\nfall 2009, with a sampling goal of 1800 deer. Surveillance will\ncontinue every year until no positive animals are detected for 5\nconsecutive years, she said.\n\nThe 2008 Legislature, led by Sen. Rod Skoe, DFL-Clearbrook, put in\nplace the bovine TB management zone and provided buyouts of herds\nthat may be infected and ordered fencing around remaining herds to\nkeep out deer.\n\nThe Agriculture Department's bovine TB czar is Joe Martin, appointed\nby Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \"He's done just a great job shepherding this\nthrough and being sure that producers are being taken care of,\" said\nKinney. \"Funding-wise, we've had a great partnership, especially with\nthe legislative folks up here. They understand the issue, they've\nbeen working very closely hand-in-hand with Joe and the DNR to be\nsure we've got that balance.\"\n\n\"This should not delay Minnesota's goal of regaining TB-Free Status,\"\nMartin said last month [May 2009] of the new deer discovery. \"We have\nbeen in contact with USDA and they have assured us this finding in\nthe deer will not impact cattle movements or the state's TB status.\"\n\nThe state's status is only impacted by finding additional TB-positive\ncattle herds. The last known infected herd was depopulated earlier\nthis year [2009] as part of the state's buyout program. There are no\nother active cattle investigations ongoing at this time, Martin said.\n\nThe buyout of herds is complete, Kinney said. \"Money-wise this coming\nyear it's going to be continuing to provide some education and\nmanagement opportunities for as long as these folks are going to need\nto be out, be sure that we're monitoring that deer population so that\nwe can get the status back as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe issue continues to be a priority of the Minnesota Farm Bureau\nFederation, which lobbied last year [2008] for the special management\nzone and funding for cattle buyouts. \"Bovine TB is still a priority\nfor us in Farm Bureau,\" Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap\nsaid in a recent interview. \"We need to do everything and anything we\ncan to eradicate that, both in the cattle and the deer herds. So\nwe'll watch that very closely.\"\n\nMinnesota state agencies and USDA have entered into a productive\npartnership in an effort to eradicate bovine TB, Kinney said. \"We\nhave a very good partnership, and I have say that's to the fact that\nCommissioner (Gene) Hugoson has served so long in a leadership role,\"\nshe said. \"That consistency has been extremely important, not only\nfor Minnesota but for APHIS and the other divisions.

No\nother deer removed this winter [2008-09] showed similar signs of\ninfection. \"We fully expected that the deer population was carrying\nsome of this, so to find one is a good sign,\" Kinney said.\n\nThe older deer makes state officials believe that bovine TB among\ndeer may be confined to a certain age class, since the infected deer\nfound since testing began in 2005 have been born in 2005 or earlier.\n\n\"It was an older deer that was found,\" Kinney said. \"That's great,\nand it means that we need to continue that diligence to seek it out.\nI don't expect we're going to have any problems, but that's why we're\nstaying on high alert on it.\"\n\nLast year [208], the US Department of Agriculture allowed Minnesota a\nsplit-state status, meaning that outside a bovine TB management area\nin northwest Beltrami County and Roseau County, the state remains TB-free.\n\nCattle sold within the bovine TB management area must undergo strict\ntesting regimes before being sold or transported across state lines.\n\nCattle are believed to contract bovine TB from infected free-ranging\ndeer, so the DNR [Department of Natural Resources] has been working\nwith USDA sharpshooters during the winter to cull the deer herd in that area.\n\nThe DNR has also conducted surveillance for TB in hunter-harvested\ndeer within a 15-mile [24 km] radius of the once-infected farms every\nfall since 2005. To date, more than 6000 deer taken by hunters and\nsharp-shooters have been tested.\n\n\"The older ages of infected deer, the lack of infection in younger\ndeer, and the close proximity of infected deer suggest the disease is\nnot efficiently spreading in the deer population,\" Michelle\nCarstensen, DNR wildlife health program coordinator, said last month\n[May 2009].\n\nDNR sampled 1246 deer taken in the bovine TB surveillance zone during\nthe fall 2008 hunt. Spring sharp-shooting efforts, that began in\nMarch and concluded 30 Apr [2009], have resulted in an additional 738\ndeer being removed near previously infected cattle operations inside\nthe management zone.\n\nDNR will continue monitoring for the disease through sampling of\nhunter-harvested deer, Carstensen said. Hunter-harvested surveillance\nwill be conducted within the larger bovine TB surveillance zone in\nfall 2009, with a sampling goal of 1800 deer. Surveillance will\ncontinue every year until no positive animals are detected for 5\nconsecutive years, she said.\n\nThe 2008 Legislature, led by Sen. Rod Skoe, DFL-Clearbrook, put in\nplace the bovine TB management zone and provided buyouts of herds\nthat may be infected and ordered fencing around remaining herds to\nkeep out deer.\n\nThe Agriculture Department's bovine TB czar is Joe Martin, appointed\nby Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \"He's done just a great job shepherding this\nthrough and being sure that producers are being taken care of,\" said\nKinney. \"Funding-wise, we've had a great partnership, especially with\nthe legislative folks up here. They understand the issue, they've\nbeen working very closely hand-in-hand with Joe and the DNR to be\nsure we've got that balance.\"\n\n\"This should not delay Minnesota's goal of regaining TB-Free Status,\"\nMartin said last month [May 2009] of the new deer discovery. \"We have\nbeen in contact with USDA and they have assured us this finding in\nthe deer will not impact cattle movements or the state's TB status.\"\n\nThe state's status is only impacted by finding additional TB-positive\ncattle herds. The last known infected herd was depopulated earlier\nthis year [2009] as part of the state's buyout program. There are no\nother active cattle investigations ongoing at this time, Martin said.\n\nThe buyout of herds is complete, Kinney said. \"Money-wise this coming\nyear it's going to be continuing to provide some education and\nmanagement opportunities for as long as these folks are going to need\nto be out, be sure that we're monitoring that deer population so that\nwe can get the status back as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe issue continues to be a priority of the Minnesota Farm Bureau\nFederation, which lobbied last year [2008] for the special management\nzone and funding for cattle buyouts. \"Bovine TB is still a priority\nfor us in Farm Bureau,\" Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap\nsaid in a recent interview. \"We need to do everything and anything we\ncan to eradicate that, both in the cattle and the deer herds. So\nwe'll watch that very closely.\"\n\nMinnesota state agencies and USDA have entered into a productive\npartnership in an effort to eradicate bovine TB, Kinney said. \"We\nhave a very good partnership, and I have say that's to the fact that\nCommissioner (Gene) Hugoson has served so long in a leadership role,\"\nshe said. \"That consistency has been extremely important, not only\nfor Minnesota but for APHIS and the other divisions.

Some 230 youngstock have\nalready been culled.\n\nThe family-run business, which makes the Daioni range of organic\nflavored milk, has insisted production levels will not be affected.\nIt has also stressed the TB outbreak poses no health risk to\nconsumers, as all its milk is pasteurized.\n\nTrioni's founder and managing director Laurence Harris said: \"We\nwould like to emphasize that business will continue as normal, as we\nhave always sourced milk from other OMSCO farms (organic milk\nsuppliers co-operative) in Pembrokeshire as well as our own.\"\n\nThe company is working with the State Veterinary Service and Assembly\nGovernment to control the outbreak. Culling of dairy cows will start\ntomorrow [7 Jan 2009].\n\nMr. Harris admitted it was \"without doubt\" a stressful time for\nstaff, but he thanked people for their support. He added: \"We are\ndeeply saddened for this to be happening to our farming business. In\ntime, we will look to rebuild our herd but will never be able to\nreplace them, as 3 generations of hard work have gone into building\nthe Ffosyficer herd.\"\n\nTrioni developed its Daioni (\"goodness\" in Welsh) range of organic\nmilk drinks as an alternative to the fizzy sugary drinks generally\navailable for children and launched them in 2003.\n\nThe multi award-winning business has expanded its customer base to\ninclude the Welsh Rugby Union and a number of Premiership football\nteams.

Some 230 youngstock have\nalready been culled.\n\nThe family-run business, which makes the Daioni range of organic\nflavored milk, has insisted production levels will not be affected.\nIt has also stressed the TB outbreak poses no health risk to\nconsumers, as all its milk is pasteurized.\n\nTrioni's founder and managing director Laurence Harris said: \"We\nwould like to emphasize that business will continue as normal, as we\nhave always sourced milk from other OMSCO farms (organic milk\nsuppliers co-operative) in Pembrokeshire as well as our own.\"\n\nThe company is working with the State Veterinary Service and Assembly\nGovernment to control the outbreak. Culling of dairy cows will start\ntomorrow [7 Jan 2009].\n\nMr. Harris admitted it was \"without doubt\" a stressful time for\nstaff, but he thanked people for their support. He added: \"We are\ndeeply saddened for this to be happening to our farming business. In\ntime, we will look to rebuild our herd but will never be able to\nreplace them, as 3 generations of hard work have gone into building\nthe Ffosyficer herd.\"\n\nTrioni developed its Daioni (\"goodness\" in Welsh) range of organic\nmilk drinks as an alternative to the fizzy sugary drinks generally\navailable for children and launched them in 2003.\n\nThe multi award-winning business has expanded its customer base to\ninclude the Welsh Rugby Union and a number of Premiership football\nteams.

The reports were predominantly _M. microti_ (10\nisolates) and _M. bovis_ (6 isolates).\n\nProcess\n-------\nThe group monitored reports over several months in 2005, and found\nthat a similar increase had also been seen in ferrets, including an\noutbreak at a ferret rescue centre. Both _Mycobacterium bovis_ and\n_M. microti_ were reported in cats and ferrets. The majority of cases\nwere in rural areas and involved the predominant spoligotypes seen in\nthe areas. Experts from Defra and VLA were consulted and it was noted\nthat the increase may partly have been due to alterations to the\ncharging arrangements for testing, which led to an increase in\nsubmissions in 2004.\n\nThe HAIRS group investigated the situation regarding _M. bovis_ and\nother potentially zoonotic mycobacteria in humans. The HAIRS group\nwere concerned over the potential for zoonotic transmission of\nmycobacteria from these spillover hosts to their owners, however\nthere was no evidence to suggest that zoonotic transmission had occurred.\n\nOutcome\n-------\nIn response to the concerns of the HAIRS group a procedure was\ninitiated whereby HPA reference laboratories send isolates of\nzoonotic mycobacteria from humans for spoligotyping at the Veterinary\nLaboratories Agency, to allow further research to be carried out and\npossible links between human and animal cases identified.\n\nIt was noted at this time that notification of TB in cats was\nnon-statutory and samples were received at VLA on an ad-hoc basis,\ntherefore identifying a trend was complicated. However _M. bovis_\nbecame notifiable in all species during 2007 and this was likely to\nimprove surveillance. The HAIRS group are continuing to monitor this issue.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HAIRS is a multiagency group under the Health Protection Agency\numbrella. Two things should be noted:\n1. VLA charging arrangements changed in 2004 and there was an\nimmediate increase in submissions;\n2. _M. bovis_ infections for all species are now notifiable, that is,\ncompulsory reporting. Both factors would have increased the number of\nreported feline TB cases whether or no there was a true increase in\nincidence. Unfortunately, this 9 Oct 2008 report does not cover 2007\nfeline TB events. - Mod.MHJ]\nSee Also\nBovine tuberculosis, domestic animals - UK (02) 20081112.3565\nBovine tuberculosis, domestic animals - UK 20081111.3551\n...................................mhj/mj/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The Dutch Agriculture Ministry has condemned this\nbreech of biosecurity, particularly as there has been no TB in the\nNetherlands since 1999.\n\nDue to the arisen situation, on 23 Jul 2008 the Commission organised\nan extraordinary SCFCAH meeting in order to clarify the TB situation\nin the UK and exchange opinion with the Member States on the measures\nto be taken in that respect.\n\nDuring the meeting the Member States agreed that at this point in\ntime immediate additional Community measures are not needed. The UK\nagreed to reinforce the controls on such movements, to ensure that\nDirective 64/432/EEC is fully applied, and that relevant information\nis transmitted to Member States of destination without delay.\n\nMember States engaged themselves to monitor the situation and to\ninform the Commission in case of new findings.\n\nMoreover, the Commission committed itself to set up in the 1st days\nof September 2008 an expert meeting to further discuss the issue and\npossible Community-wide measures.\n\nGeneral discussion and issues raised by the participants\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThe Netherlands presented the situation and the measures taken due to\nthe detection of TB positive calves below 6 weeks of age introduced\nvia intra-Community trade to the officially TB free bovine herds at\ntheir territory.\n\nThe United Kingdom updated the participants on the current situation\nas regards bovine tuberculosis on the territory of their country and\non measures taken in relation to the breakdown in an officially\ntuberculosis-free herd of origin of the calves, found later TB\npositive in the Netherlands. The UK emphasised that this isolated\nincident was due to a case of bovine tuberculosis mastitis.\n\nCertain Member States and in particular the Netherlands urged that\naction be taken at all levels and especially by the Member States not\nyet officially bovine tuberculosis-free to ensure that eradication of\nthe disease is accelerated.\n\nThe Commission gave a brief overview of the Community legislation on\nbovine tuberculosis noting that calves under 42 days of age are\nexempted for the requirement of the pre-movement testing and that in\nthis case, current EU provisions rely only on the status of the herd.\nIn addition, the Commission presented for discussion 4 possible\nalternative provisions which could be implemented, either one at a\ntime or in combination, in order to prevent the spread of TB from\nareas with high prevalence of the disease via intra-Community trade\nin calves under 42 days of age, and in particular apart from the\nmandatory officially tuberculosis-free herd origin:\n\n1. Pre-movement test (intradermal skin test or gamma interferon test)\nof individual animals concerned;\n2. Low prevalence region origin (below 1 or 0,5 percent or other);\n3. Recent herd test (such as, less then 6 months) with strictly\ndefined frequency of testing the herd (annual, twice a year, etc.);\n4. Channelling procedure (post-movement test at destination or\ndispatched to a holding at destination from which they can only be\nmoved directly to a slaughterhouse).\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThere was general consensus on:\n- the need to ensure that the officially bovine tuberculosis-free (TB\nOF) status is properly granted to the herds, as this is the basic\nrequirement in order to ensure safe trade;\n- the pre-movement testing is not suitable for animals younger than\n42 days of age due to the lack of sensitivity of the test when used\non these animals;\n- there is a need to have proportionate and effective measures in\norder to address the risk posed by these animals that cannot be\ntested before movement.\n\nAn acceptable regime for animals below 42 days of age would be as follows:\nBovine animals for breeding and production less than 42 days old\nshall only be dispatched to other Member States if they come from an\nofficially tuberculosis-free bovine herd as defined in Article\n2(2)(d) of Directive 64/432/EEC, and:\n\n1.

The Dutch Agriculture Ministry has condemned this\nbreech of biosecurity, particularly as there has been no TB in the\nNetherlands since 1999.\n\nDue to the arisen situation, on 23 Jul 2008 the Commission organised\nan extraordinary SCFCAH meeting in order to clarify the TB situation\nin the UK and exchange opinion with the Member States on the measures\nto be taken in that respect.\n\nDuring the meeting the Member States agreed that at this point in\ntime immediate additional Community measures are not needed.

The Dutch Agriculture Ministry has condemned this\nbreech of biosecurity, particularly as there has been no TB in the\nNetherlands since 1999.\n\nDue to the arisen situation, on 23 Jul 2008 the Commission organised\nan extraordinary SCFCAH meeting in order to clarify the TB situation\nin the UK and exchange opinion with the Member States on the measures\nto be taken in that respect.\n\nDuring the meeting the Member States agreed that at this point in\ntime immediate additional Community measures are not needed. The UK\nagreed to reinforce the controls on such movements, to ensure that\nDirective 64/432/EEC is fully applied, and that relevant information\nis transmitted to Member States of destination without delay.\n\nMember States engaged themselves to monitor the situation and to\ninform the Commission in case of new findings.\n\nMoreover, the Commission committed itself to set up in the 1st days\nof September 2008 an expert meeting to further discuss the issue and\npossible Community-wide measures.\n\nGeneral discussion and issues raised by the participants\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThe Netherlands presented the situation and the measures taken due to\nthe detection of TB positive calves below 6 weeks of age introduced\nvia intra-Community trade to the officially TB free bovine herds at\ntheir territory.\n\nThe United Kingdom updated the participants on the current situation\nas regards bovine tuberculosis on the territory of their country and\non measures taken in relation to the breakdown in an officially\ntuberculosis-free herd of origin of the calves, found later TB\npositive in the Netherlands. The UK emphasised that this isolated\nincident was due to a case of bovine tuberculosis mastitis.\n\nCertain Member States and in particular the Netherlands urged that\naction be taken at all levels and especially by the Member States not\nyet officially bovine tuberculosis-free to ensure that eradication of\nthe disease is accelerated.\n\nThe Commission gave a brief overview of the Community legislation on\nbovine tuberculosis noting that calves under 42 days of age are\nexempted for the requirement of the pre-movement testing and that in\nthis case, current EU provisions rely only on the status of the herd.\nIn addition, the Commission presented for discussion 4 possible\nalternative provisions which could be implemented, either one at a\ntime or in combination, in order to prevent the spread of TB from\nareas with high prevalence of the disease via intra-Community trade\nin calves under 42 days of age, and in particular apart from the\nmandatory officially tuberculosis-free herd origin:\n\n1. Pre-movement test (intradermal skin test or gamma interferon test)\nof individual animals concerned;\n2. Low prevalence region origin (below 1 or 0,5 percent or other);\n3. Recent herd test (such as, less then 6 months) with strictly\ndefined frequency of testing the herd (annual, twice a year, etc.);\n4. Channelling procedure (post-movement test at destination or\ndispatched to a holding at destination from which they can only be\nmoved directly to a slaughterhouse).\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThere was general consensus on:\n- the need to ensure that the officially bovine tuberculosis-free (TB\nOF) status is properly granted to the herds, as this is the basic\nrequirement in order to ensure safe trade;\n- the pre-movement testing is not suitable for animals younger than\n42 days of age due to the lack of sensitivity of the test when used\non these animals;\n- there is a need to have proportionate and effective measures in\norder to address the risk posed by these animals that cannot be\ntested before movement.\n\nAn acceptable regime for animals below 42 days of age would be as follows:\nBovine animals for breeding and production less than 42 days old\nshall only be dispatched to other Member States if they come from an\nofficially tuberculosis-free bovine herd as defined in Article\n2(2)(d) of Directive 64/432/EEC, and:\n\n1. The holding of origin is situated in a Member State or a region of\na Member State as defined in Article 2(2)(p) of Directive 64/432/EEC\nin which on average, determined at 31 December of each year, the\nannual percentages of bovine herds confirmed as infected with\ntuberculosis is not more than 0.5 percent of all herds within the\nMember State or region thereof, or\n2. All animals in the holding of origin, with the exception of\nanimals under 6 weeks old, have been subjected with negative results\nto the routine intradermal tuberculin test in accordance with Annex B\nto Directive 64/432/EEC at an interval of more than 3 months and less\nthan 6 months during the last 12 months, or\n3. All animals in the holding of origin, with the exception of\nanimals under 6 weeks old, have been subjected with negative results\nto the intradermal tuberculin test in accordance with Annex B to\nDirective 64/432/EEC, carried out in the 30 days prior to the\nmovement, or\n4. The animals are consigned, through a channelling procedure under\nthe control of the competent authority of the place of destination,\nto a holding from where they can only be removed:\na. to be transported directly to the slaughterhouse for slaughter in\naccordance with the first indent of Article 7 of Directive\n64/432/EEC, or\nb. to be introduced not earlier than at the age of at least 42 days\ninto another herd in accordance with the procedure provided for in\npoint 1(c) of Section I of Annex A to Directive 64/432/EEC [see\ncommentary. - Mod.AS]\n\nOn 3 Sep 2008 the conclusions of the meeting were presented to the\nStanding Committee for Food Chain and Animal Health under point 4D of\nthe Committee's agenda.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Directive 64/432/EEC, point C of section I in Annex A says: \"no\nbovine animal has been introduced without a certificate from an\nofficial veterinarian showing that the animal has reacted negatively\nto an intradermal tuberculin test assessed according to the criteria\nset out in Annex B 21 (a) and that it comes from an officially\ntuberculosis-free herd\".\n\nArticle 21 (a) of Annex B says: \"the result of the intradermal\ntuberculin test must be read after 72 hours and assessed according to\nthe following method: (a) negative reaction: if only limited swelling\nis observed, with an increase of not more than 2 mm in the thickness\nof the fold of skin without clinical signs such as pasty consistency,\nexudation, necrosis, pain or inflammation of the lymphatic ducts in\nthat region and of the lymph nodes. - Mod.AS]\nSee Also\nBovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK: (England) 20080903.2751\nBovine tuberculosis, caprine - UK: (Wales) 20080723.2229\nBovine tuberculosis - UK, Ireland, Netherlands ex UK 20080718.2186\n2007\n----\nBovine tuberculosis - UK, Ireland 20070731.2473\n2006\n----\nBovine tuberculosis, human - UK (England) (02) 20061015.2967\nTuberculosis, bovine, badgers - UK (03) 20061014.2945\nTuberculosis, bovine, badgers - UK (02) 20061011.2915\nBovine tuberculosis, human - UK (England) 20061009.2896\nTuberculosis, bovine, badgers - UK 20061005.2857\nTuberculosis, bovine - UK: badger vaccine trial 20060622.1724\n...................................arn/mj/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

A further 27\nfarms that have been in contact with the original 6 are now under\nrestriction and Dutch vets are testing more than 4000 cattle for the disease.\n\nUnofficially, Belgian farmers are also refusing to take British calves and\nadult cattle. Exporters fear that a complete ban on the trade of live\ncattle throughout the European Union could be in force next week. The news\nhas shocked farmers in the Netherlands, which has been free of TB since 1994.\n\nDuring 2006, the UK exported a total of 81 000 live calves. That figure\nfell to 64 000 in 2007 as a result of export restrictions due to\nfoot-and-mouth disease, but was recovering well this year [2008] and latest\nfigures to June reveal that 40 000 had crossed the English Channel.\n\nThe next 3 months is the peak period when most UK calves are selected for\nthe export trade to the Netherlands, and any disruption to this trade will\nresult in the complete collapse of export businesses that have already lost\nmillions because of last year's [2007] foot and mouth disease ban.\n\nNFU (National Farmers' Union) Scotland vice-president Nigel Miller said:\n\"This is a very worrying development at a time when Scotland's dairy\nfarmers are achieving BP 50 to BP 60 per head [USD 99.70 to 119.64] for\nexport-quality bull calves. \"We have spoken to Scotland's chief vet to\nraise our concerns while our Brussels office is in dialogue with their\nDutch union counterparts on the subject. If the Commission becomes\ninvolved, then what we would want to see is a proportionate response to\nthis issue, one which takes the wider calf trade in the EU into\nconsideration and one which stops well short of a unilateral ban on live\ncalf exports from the UK.\n\n\"Scotland has worked hard to preserve its excellent record on TB. We\nalready have low incidence status and, as an industry, we have set targets\nto further reduce the number of cases of TB seen here. Any suggestion of a\nEuropean ban on live calves affecting Scotland would be unjustified and\nunnecessary.\"\n\n[byline: Rog Wood]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] UK (Wales): badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Tue 15 Jul 2008\nSource: Wales Online, Western Mail report [edited]\n<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/countryside-farming-news/farming-news/2008/07/15/wales-will-kill-badgers-row-91466-21339761/>\n\n\nWales will kill badgers -- row\n------------------------------\nThe DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)\nsecretary of state's decision to rule out a badger cull in England will not\naffect proposals to go ahead with one in Wales.\n\nRural Affairs minister Elin Jones said nothing had changed and plans for a\ncull in a pilot area as part of a package of measures to eradicate bTB\n[bovine tuberculosis] were proceeding as announced last April [2008]. \"It\nhas not affected my thinking at all. Various expert groups set up to advise\nare gathering information as we speak on the various factors we need to\ntake account of,\" said Ms Jones. \"Then at some point later in the year I\nwill be given advice from my officials as to what, when and where.\"\n\nAmong the issues that need to be addressed is the willingness of all\nlandowners to take part in the trial cull. This will only work if officials\nare able to slaughter all the animals within a clearly defined area in\norder to gauge whether it has any effect on the spread of the disease.\n\nA small minority of farmers opposes a badger cull, and larger numbers of\nlandowners with small acreages may try to prevent it from happening. The\nBadger Trust has already lodged an application for a judicial review of a\n\"naive and short-sighted political decision\". The trust claims the badger\nplays no role in the spread of bTB, which now affects more than 2000 farms\nin Wales. Last year [2007] nearly 8000 cattle were culled at a cost in\ncompensation to farmers of BP 15.2m [USD 30.3m].\n\n\"The harsh reality is that Wales' bovine TB problem can be easily traced to\ncattle movements and farming practices,\" says a Badger Trust report. \"There\nis a clear and known correlation between larger herd sizes and an increased\nrisk of bovine TB.\"\n\nThe National Farmers' Union has promised a legal challenge to what it calls\nthe UK environment minister Hilary Benn's \"disgraceful abdication of\nresponsibility\" in ruling out a cull. NFU president, Bedfordshire farmer\nPeter Kendall and vice president Meurig Raymond, who farms in\nPembrokeshire, led a demonstration outside the House of Parliament after Mr\nBenn's announcement. Mr Kendall said the NFU would mount a legal challenge\nand withdraw from talks on cost and responsibility sharing. The Tenant\nFarmers Association (TFA) has also pulled out of talks on sharing the costs\nand responsibilities of animal diseases, which it describes as\n\"hypocritical and damaging\" without controls of bTB in wildlife.\n\n[byline: Steve Dube]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] UK (Scotland): badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Fri 18 Jul 2008\nSource: Business Scotsman [edited]\n<http://business.scotsman.com/fooddrinkagriculture/TB-outbreak--raises-fears.4301536.jp>\n\n\nTB outbreak raises fears of ban on UK calves\n--------------------------------------------\nThere appears to be a real possibility that the export of young bull calves\nfrom dairy herds in the UK to mainland Europe may be banned following the\ndiscovery to bovine tuberculosis on 27 farms in the Netherlands.\n\nA dairy herd in England, previously free from TB, has suffered a breakdown\nand it is believed that calves from this farm are the source of the\nproblem, which was discovered during routine testing.\n\nAbout 400 000 calves are exported at around 10 days of age from the UK for\nveal production. These must come from TB-free farms. However, there is no\nreliable test for TB in animals that are aged less than 42 days.\n\nIn certain parts of the European Union, there is a view that the UK is a\nreservoir of disease: first BSE in 1996, then the world's largest epidemic\nof foot and mouth disease in 2001 followed by a smaller outbreak of the\nsame disease last year [2007].\n\nThe vast majority of farmers and many leading scientists assert there is a\nclear link between TB and badgers, which are deemed to be the principal\nvector of this disease.\n\nThe latest forecast is that up to 40 000 cattle in England will be culled\nduring 2008. Only last week Hilary Benn, the secretary of state at DEFRA\n(UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs), ruled out a cull\nof badgers. He said that a cull of badgers \"could end up making the disease\nworse if it was not sustained over time or delivered effectively and public\nopposition, including the unwillingness of some landowners to take part,\nwould render this more difficult.\"\n\nJeff Rooker, a junior minister at DEFRA, is of a different opinion.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords he said: \"Badger-to-cattle transmission is\nheavy. It accounts for 70-80 per cent [of] cases.\"\n\n[byline: Dan Buglass]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Ireland: badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Thu 17 Jul 2008\nSource: Farmers Weekly Interactive [edited]\n<http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/07/17/111222/badger-cull-has-desired-effect-in-ireland.html>\n\n\nBadger cull has desired effect in Ireland\n-----------------------------------------\nThe incidence of bovine TB in the Republic of Ireland continues to decline,\nas the department of agriculture in Dublin presses on with its cull of\ninfected badgers. A government spokeswoman explained that, even though\nthere had been a slight increase in 2007, this was because the level of\ntesting had increased substantially following the opening of a new\nlaboratory in Sligo. Slaughterhouse inspection procedures had also\nimproved. \"With TB you should never look at one year in isolation, as there\nare so many pieces that go together,\" she said. \"It's best to look at 5\nyear trends and that shows a steady fall in TB.\"\n\nFor example, in 1998 the number of TB reactors came to 45 000, but by 2003\nhad dropped to 28 000. In 2006 there was a further fall to 24 000, though\nlast year [2007] it was up to 28 000. Disease incidence stands at about 6\nper cent of herds tested, compared with 8.2 per cent in the peak year of 2000.\n\nThe Irish government is adamant that badger culling is a key factor in\ncontaining the disease. \"Elsewhere in the world, the tuberculin test\nprovides all the control necessary to get on top of TB. Only in Ireland and\nGB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the\ncommon vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that\nhad been taken out.\n\nBadger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is\nonly triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study\nimplicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman\ninsisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely\nto reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a\nvaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no\nproblem with perturbation. \"It seems our badger populations are quite\ndifferent,\" she said. \"They have different diets, different reproduction,\nand different densities. Their social groups are smaller and they are less\nterritorial.\"\n\nThe government has a self-imposed cap of culling on just 30 per cent of the\nagricultural area. So far it has covered about 20 per cent, taking out\nabout 2 thirds of the badgers in that area. About half of these were TB\ninfected.\n\nFarmers contribute to the cost of the programme with a statutory levy on\nmilk sales, and on cattle slaughtered or exported.\n\n[byline: Philip Clarke]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional information on the recent bovine tuberculosis developments in\nEngland, which -- according to available science-based information -- is\ndirectly related to the infection in badgers, can be found at\n<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4340286.ece>.\n\nDEFRA's explanatory information is available at\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm>.\n\nThe number of new outbreaks in cattle during 2007, as reported to the OIE\n(World Organisation for Animal Health), was: England -- 3153(!); Wales --\n902; Scotland -- 58.

These must come from TB-free farms. However, there is no\nreliable test for TB in animals that are aged less than 42 days.\n\nIn certain parts of the European Union, there is a view that the UK is a\nreservoir of disease: first BSE in 1996, then the world's largest epidemic\nof foot and mouth disease in 2001 followed by a smaller outbreak of the\nsame disease last year [2007].\n\nThe vast majority of farmers and many leading scientists assert there is a\nclear link between TB and badgers, which are deemed to be the principal\nvector of this disease.\n\nThe latest forecast is that up to 40 000 cattle in England will be culled\nduring 2008. Only last week Hilary Benn, the secretary of state at DEFRA\n(UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs), ruled out a cull\nof badgers. He said that a cull of badgers \"could end up making the disease\nworse if it was not sustained over time or delivered effectively and public\nopposition, including the unwillingness of some landowners to take part,\nwould render this more difficult.\"\n\nJeff Rooker, a junior minister at DEFRA, is of a different opinion.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords he said: \"Badger-to-cattle transmission is\nheavy. It accounts for 70-80 per cent [of] cases.\"\n\n[byline: Dan Buglass]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Ireland: badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Thu 17 Jul 2008\nSource: Farmers Weekly Interactive [edited]\n<http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/07/17/111222/badger-cull-has-desired-effect-in-ireland.html>\n\n\nBadger cull has desired effect in Ireland\n-----------------------------------------\nThe incidence of bovine TB in the Republic of Ireland continues to decline,\nas the department of agriculture in Dublin presses on with its cull of\ninfected badgers. A government spokeswoman explained that, even though\nthere had been a slight increase in 2007, this was because the level of\ntesting had increased substantially following the opening of a new\nlaboratory in Sligo. Slaughterhouse inspection procedures had also\nimproved. \"With TB you should never look at one year in isolation, as there\nare so many pieces that go together,\" she said. \"It's best to look at 5\nyear trends and that shows a steady fall in TB.\"\n\nFor example, in 1998 the number of TB reactors came to 45 000, but by 2003\nhad dropped to 28 000. In 2006 there was a further fall to 24 000, though\nlast year [2007] it was up to 28 000. Disease incidence stands at about 6\nper cent of herds tested, compared with 8.2 per cent in the peak year of 2000.\n\nThe Irish government is adamant that badger culling is a key factor in\ncontaining the disease. \"Elsewhere in the world, the tuberculin test\nprovides all the control necessary to get on top of TB. Only in Ireland and\nGB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the\ncommon vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that\nhad been taken out.\n\nBadger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is\nonly triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study\nimplicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman\ninsisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely\nto reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a\nvaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no\nproblem with perturbation. \"It seems our badger populations are quite\ndifferent,\" she said. \"They have different diets, different reproduction,\nand different densities. Their social groups are smaller and they are less\nterritorial.\"\n\nThe government has a self-imposed cap of culling on just 30 per cent of the\nagricultural area. So far it has covered about 20 per cent, taking out\nabout 2 thirds of the badgers in that area. About half of these were TB\ninfected.\n\nFarmers contribute to the cost of the programme with a statutory levy on\nmilk sales, and on cattle slaughtered or exported.\n\n[byline: Philip Clarke]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional information on the recent bovine tuberculosis developments in\nEngland, which -- according to available science-based information -- is\ndirectly related to the infection in badgers, can be found at\n<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4340286.ece>.\n\nDEFRA's explanatory information is available at\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm>.\n\nThe number of new outbreaks in cattle during 2007, as reported to the OIE\n(World Organisation for Animal Health), was: England -- 3153(!); Wales --\n902; Scotland -- 58.

A government spokeswoman explained that, even though\nthere had been a slight increase in 2007, this was because the level of\ntesting had increased substantially following the opening of a new\nlaboratory in Sligo. Slaughterhouse inspection procedures had also\nimproved. \"With TB you should never look at one year in isolation, as there\nare so many pieces that go together,\" she said. \"It's best to look at 5\nyear trends and that shows a steady fall in TB.\"\n\nFor example, in 1998 the number of TB reactors came to 45 000, but by 2003\nhad dropped to 28 000. In 2006 there was a further fall to 24 000, though\nlast year [2007] it was up to 28 000. Disease incidence stands at about 6\nper cent of herds tested, compared with 8.2 per cent in the peak year of 2000.\n\nThe Irish government is adamant that badger culling is a key factor in\ncontaining the disease. \"Elsewhere in the world, the tuberculin test\nprovides all the control necessary to get on top of TB. Only in Ireland and\nGB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the\ncommon vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that\nhad been taken out.\n\nBadger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is\nonly triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study\nimplicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman\ninsisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely\nto reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a\nvaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no\nproblem with perturbation. \"It seems our badger populations are quite\ndifferent,\" she said. \"They have different diets, different reproduction,\nand different densities. Their social groups are smaller and they are less\nterritorial.\"\n\nThe government has a self-imposed cap of culling on just 30 per cent of the\nagricultural area. So far it has covered about 20 per cent, taking out\nabout 2 thirds of the badgers in that area.

A further 27\nfarms that have been in contact with the original 6 are now under\nrestriction and Dutch vets are testing more than 4000 cattle for the disease.\n\nUnofficially, Belgian farmers are also refusing to take British calves and\nadult cattle. Exporters fear that a complete ban on the trade of live\ncattle throughout the European Union could be in force next week. The news\nhas shocked farmers in the Netherlands, which has been free of TB since 1994.\n\nDuring 2006, the UK exported a total of 81 000 live calves. That figure\nfell to 64 000 in 2007 as a result of export restrictions due to\nfoot-and-mouth disease, but was recovering well this year [2008] and latest\nfigures to June reveal that 40 000 had crossed the English Channel.\n\nThe next 3 months is the peak period when most UK calves are selected for\nthe export trade to the Netherlands, and any disruption to this trade will\nresult in the complete collapse of export businesses that have already lost\nmillions because of last year's [2007] foot and mouth disease ban.\n\nNFU (National Farmers' Union) Scotland vice-president Nigel Miller said:\n\"This is a very worrying development at a time when Scotland's dairy\nfarmers are achieving BP 50 to BP 60 per head [USD 99.70 to 119.64] for\nexport-quality bull calves. \"We have spoken to Scotland's chief vet to\nraise our concerns while our Brussels office is in dialogue with their\nDutch union counterparts on the subject. If the Commission becomes\ninvolved, then what we would want to see is a proportionate response to\nthis issue, one which takes the wider calf trade in the EU into\nconsideration and one which stops well short of a unilateral ban on live\ncalf exports from the UK.\n\n\"Scotland has worked hard to preserve its excellent record on TB. We\nalready have low incidence status and, as an industry, we have set targets\nto further reduce the number of cases of TB seen here. Any suggestion of a\nEuropean ban on live calves affecting Scotland would be unjustified and\nunnecessary.\"\n\n[byline: Rog Wood]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] UK (Wales): badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Tue 15 Jul 2008\nSource: Wales Online, Western Mail report [edited]\n<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/countryside-farming-news/farming-news/2008/07/15/wales-will-kill-badgers-row-91466-21339761/>\n\n\nWales will kill badgers -- row\n------------------------------\nThe DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)\nsecretary of state's decision to rule out a badger cull in England will not\naffect proposals to go ahead with one in Wales.\n\nRural Affairs minister Elin Jones said nothing had changed and plans for a\ncull in a pilot area as part of a package of measures to eradicate bTB\n[bovine tuberculosis] were proceeding as announced last April [2008]. \"It\nhas not affected my thinking at all. Various expert groups set up to advise\nare gathering information as we speak on the various factors we need to\ntake account of,\" said Ms Jones. \"Then at some point later in the year I\nwill be given advice from my officials as to what, when and where.\"\n\nAmong the issues that need to be addressed is the willingness of all\nlandowners to take part in the trial cull. This will only work if officials\nare able to slaughter all the animals within a clearly defined area in\norder to gauge whether it has any effect on the spread of the disease.\n\nA small minority of farmers opposes a badger cull, and larger numbers of\nlandowners with small acreages may try to prevent it from happening. The\nBadger Trust has already lodged an application for a judicial review of a\n\"naive and short-sighted political decision\". The trust claims the badger\nplays no role in the spread of bTB, which now affects more than 2000 farms\nin Wales. Last year [2007] nearly 8000 cattle were culled at a cost in\ncompensation to farmers of BP 15.2m [USD 30.3m].\n\n\"The harsh reality is that Wales' bovine TB problem can be easily traced to\ncattle movements and farming practices,\" says a Badger Trust report. \"There\nis a clear and known correlation between larger herd sizes and an increased\nrisk of bovine TB.\"\n\nThe National Farmers' Union has promised a legal challenge to what it calls\nthe UK environment minister Hilary Benn's \"disgraceful abdication of\nresponsibility\" in ruling out a cull. NFU president, Bedfordshire farmer\nPeter Kendall and vice president Meurig Raymond, who farms in\nPembrokeshire, led a demonstration outside the House of Parliament after Mr\nBenn's announcement.

Various expert groups set up to advise\nare gathering information as we speak on the various factors we need to\ntake account of,\" said Ms Jones. \"Then at some point later in the year I\nwill be given advice from my officials as to what, when and where.\"\n\nAmong the issues that need to be addressed is the willingness of all\nlandowners to take part in the trial cull. This will only work if officials\nare able to slaughter all the animals within a clearly defined area in\norder to gauge whether it has any effect on the spread of the disease.\n\nA small minority of farmers opposes a badger cull, and larger numbers of\nlandowners with small acreages may try to prevent it from happening. The\nBadger Trust has already lodged an application for a judicial review of a\n\"naive and short-sighted political decision\". The trust claims the badger\nplays no role in the spread of bTB, which now affects more than 2000 farms\nin Wales. Last year [2007] nearly 8000 cattle were culled at a cost in\ncompensation to farmers of BP 15.2m [USD 30.3m].\n\n\"The harsh reality is that Wales' bovine TB problem can be easily traced to\ncattle movements and farming practices,\" says a Badger Trust report. \"There\nis a clear and known correlation between larger herd sizes and an increased\nrisk of bovine TB.\"\n\nThe National Farmers' Union has promised a legal challenge to what it calls\nthe UK environment minister Hilary Benn's \"disgraceful abdication of\nresponsibility\" in ruling out a cull. NFU president, Bedfordshire farmer\nPeter Kendall and vice president Meurig Raymond, who farms in\nPembrokeshire, led a demonstration outside the House of Parliament after Mr\nBenn's announcement. Mr Kendall said the NFU would mount a legal challenge\nand withdraw from talks on cost and responsibility sharing. The Tenant\nFarmers Association (TFA) has also pulled out of talks on sharing the costs\nand responsibilities of animal diseases, which it describes as\n\"hypocritical and damaging\" without controls of bTB in wildlife.\n\n[byline: Steve Dube]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] UK (Scotland): badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Fri 18 Jul 2008\nSource: Business Scotsman [edited]\n<http://business.scotsman.com/fooddrinkagriculture/TB-outbreak--raises-fears.4301536.jp>\n\n\nTB outbreak raises fears of ban on UK calves\n--------------------------------------------\nThere appears to be a real possibility that the export of young bull calves\nfrom dairy herds in the UK to mainland Europe may be banned following the\ndiscovery to bovine tuberculosis on 27 farms in the Netherlands.\n\nA dairy herd in England, previously free from TB, has suffered a breakdown\nand it is believed that calves from this farm are the source of the\nproblem, which was discovered during routine testing.\n\nAbout 400 000 calves are exported at around 10 days of age from the UK for\nveal production. These must come from TB-free farms. However, there is no\nreliable test for TB in animals that are aged less than 42 days.\n\nIn certain parts of the European Union, there is a view that the UK is a\nreservoir of disease: first BSE in 1996, then the world's largest epidemic\nof foot and mouth disease in 2001 followed by a smaller outbreak of the\nsame disease last year [2007].\n\nThe vast majority of farmers and many leading scientists assert there is a\nclear link between TB and badgers, which are deemed to be the principal\nvector of this disease.\n\nThe latest forecast is that up to 40 000 cattle in England will be culled\nduring 2008. Only last week Hilary Benn, the secretary of state at DEFRA\n(UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs), ruled out a cull\nof badgers. He said that a cull of badgers \"could end up making the disease\nworse if it was not sustained over time or delivered effectively and public\nopposition, including the unwillingness of some landowners to take part,\nwould render this more difficult.\"\n\nJeff Rooker, a junior minister at DEFRA, is of a different opinion.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords he said: \"Badger-to-cattle transmission is\nheavy. It accounts for 70-80 per cent [of] cases.\"\n\n[byline: Dan Buglass]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Ireland: badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Thu 17 Jul 2008\nSource: Farmers Weekly Interactive [edited]\n<http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/07/17/111222/badger-cull-has-desired-effect-in-ireland.html>\n\n\nBadger cull has desired effect in Ireland\n-----------------------------------------\nThe incidence of bovine TB in the Republic of Ireland continues to decline,\nas the department of agriculture in Dublin presses on with its cull of\ninfected badgers. A government spokeswoman explained that, even though\nthere had been a slight increase in 2007, this was because the level of\ntesting had increased substantially following the opening of a new\nlaboratory in Sligo. Slaughterhouse inspection procedures had also\nimproved. \"With TB you should never look at one year in isolation, as there\nare so many pieces that go together,\" she said. \"It's best to look at 5\nyear trends and that shows a steady fall in TB.\"\n\nFor example, in 1998 the number of TB reactors came to 45 000, but by 2003\nhad dropped to 28 000. In 2006 there was a further fall to 24 000, though\nlast year [2007] it was up to 28 000. Disease incidence stands at about 6\nper cent of herds tested, compared with 8.2 per cent in the peak year of 2000.\n\nThe Irish government is adamant that badger culling is a key factor in\ncontaining the disease. \"Elsewhere in the world, the tuberculin test\nprovides all the control necessary to get on top of TB. Only in Ireland and\nGB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the\ncommon vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that\nhad been taken out.\n\nBadger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is\nonly triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study\nimplicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman\ninsisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely\nto reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a\nvaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no\nproblem with perturbation. \"It seems our badger populations are quite\ndifferent,\" she said. \"They have different diets, different reproduction,\nand different densities. Their social groups are smaller and they are less\nterritorial.\"\n\nThe government has a self-imposed cap of culling on just 30 per cent of the\nagricultural area. So far it has covered about 20 per cent, taking out\nabout 2 thirds of the badgers in that area. About half of these were TB\ninfected.\n\nFarmers contribute to the cost of the programme with a statutory levy on\nmilk sales, and on cattle slaughtered or exported.\n\n[byline: Philip Clarke]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional information on the recent bovine tuberculosis developments in\nEngland, which -- according to available science-based information -- is\ndirectly related to the infection in badgers, can be found at\n<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4340286.ece>.\n\nDEFRA's explanatory information is available at\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm>.\n\nThe number of new outbreaks in cattle during 2007, as reported to the OIE\n(World Organisation for Animal Health), was: England -- 3153(!); Wales --\n902; Scotland -- 58.

Only in Ireland and\nGB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the\ncommon vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that\nhad been taken out.\n\nBadger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is\nonly triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study\nimplicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman\ninsisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely\nto reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a\nvaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no\nproblem with perturbation. \"It seems our badger populations are quite\ndifferent,\" she said. \"They have different diets, different reproduction,\nand different densities.

A further 27\nfarms that have been in contact with the original 6 are now under\nrestriction and Dutch vets are testing more than 4000 cattle for the disease.\n\nUnofficially, Belgian farmers are also refusing to take British calves and\nadult cattle. Exporters fear that a complete ban on the trade of live\ncattle throughout the European Union could be in force next week. The news\nhas shocked farmers in the Netherlands, which has been free of TB since 1994.\n\nDuring 2006, the UK exported a total of 81 000 live calves. That figure\nfell to 64 000 in 2007 as a result of export restrictions due to\nfoot-and-mouth disease, but was recovering well this year [2008] and latest\nfigures to June reveal that 40 000 had crossed the English Channel.\n\nThe next 3 months is the peak period when most UK calves are selected for\nthe export trade to the Netherlands, and any disruption to this trade will\nresult in the complete collapse of export businesses that have already lost\nmillions because of last year's [2007] foot and mouth disease ban.\n\nNFU (National Farmers' Union) Scotland vice-president Nigel Miller said:\n\"This is a very worrying development at a time when Scotland's dairy\nfarmers are achieving BP 50 to BP 60 per head [USD 99.70 to 119.64] for\nexport-quality bull calves. \"We have spoken to Scotland's chief vet to\nraise our concerns while our Brussels office is in dialogue with their\nDutch union counterparts on the subject. If the Commission becomes\ninvolved, then what we would want to see is a proportionate response to\nthis issue, one which takes the wider calf trade in the EU into\nconsideration and one which stops well short of a unilateral ban on live\ncalf exports from the UK.\n\n\"Scotland has worked hard to preserve its excellent record on TB.

A further 27\nfarms that have been in contact with the original 6 are now under\nrestriction and Dutch vets are testing more than 4000 cattle for the disease.\n\nUnofficially, Belgian farmers are also refusing to take British calves and\nadult cattle. Exporters fear that a complete ban on the trade of live\ncattle throughout the European Union could be in force next week. The news\nhas shocked farmers in the Netherlands, which has been free of TB since 1994.\n\nDuring 2006, the UK exported a total of 81 000 live calves. That figure\nfell to 64 000 in 2007 as a result of export restrictions due to\nfoot-and-mouth disease, but was recovering well this year [2008] and latest\nfigures to June reveal that 40 000 had crossed the English Channel.\n\nThe next 3 months is the peak period when most UK calves are selected for\nthe export trade to the Netherlands, and any disruption to this trade will\nresult in the complete collapse of export businesses that have already lost\nmillions because of last year's [2007] foot and mouth disease ban.\n\nNFU (National Farmers' Union) Scotland vice-president Nigel Miller said:\n\"This is a very worrying development at a time when Scotland's dairy\nfarmers are achieving BP 50 to BP 60 per head [USD 99.70 to 119.64] for\nexport-quality bull calves. \"We have spoken to Scotland's chief vet to\nraise our concerns while our Brussels office is in dialogue with their\nDutch union counterparts on the subject. If the Commission becomes\ninvolved, then what we would want to see is a proportionate response to\nthis issue, one which takes the wider calf trade in the EU into\nconsideration and one which stops well short of a unilateral ban on live\ncalf exports from the UK.\n\n\"Scotland has worked hard to preserve its excellent record on TB. We\nalready have low incidence status and, as an industry, we have set targets\nto further reduce the number of cases of TB seen here. Any suggestion of a\nEuropean ban on live calves affecting Scotland would be unjustified and\nunnecessary.\"\n\n[byline: Rog Wood]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] UK (Wales): badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Tue 15 Jul 2008\nSource: Wales Online, Western Mail report [edited]\n<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/countryside-farming-news/farming-news/2008/07/15/wales-will-kill-badgers-row-91466-21339761/>\n\n\nWales will kill badgers -- row\n------------------------------\nThe DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)\nsecretary of state's decision to rule out a badger cull in England will not\naffect proposals to go ahead with one in Wales.\n\nRural Affairs minister Elin Jones said nothing had changed and plans for a\ncull in a pilot area as part of a package of measures to eradicate bTB\n[bovine tuberculosis] were proceeding as announced last April [2008]. \"It\nhas not affected my thinking at all. Various expert groups set up to advise\nare gathering information as we speak on the various factors we need to\ntake account of,\" said Ms Jones. \"Then at some point later in the year I\nwill be given advice from my officials as to what, when and where.\"\n\nAmong the issues that need to be addressed is the willingness of all\nlandowners to take part in the trial cull. This will only work if officials\nare able to slaughter all the animals within a clearly defined area in\norder to gauge whether it has any effect on the spread of the disease.\n\nA small minority of farmers opposes a badger cull, and larger numbers of\nlandowners with small acreages may try to prevent it from happening. The\nBadger Trust has already lodged an application for a judicial review of a\n\"naive and short-sighted political decision\". The trust claims the badger\nplays no role in the spread of bTB, which now affects more than 2000 farms\nin Wales. Last year [2007] nearly 8000 cattle were culled at a cost in\ncompensation to farmers of BP 15.2m [USD 30.3m].\n\n\"The harsh reality is that Wales' bovine TB problem can be easily traced to\ncattle movements and farming practices,\" says a Badger Trust report. \"There\nis a clear and known correlation between larger herd sizes and an increased\nrisk of bovine TB.\"\n\nThe National Farmers' Union has promised a legal challenge to what it calls\nthe UK environment minister Hilary Benn's \"disgraceful abdication of\nresponsibility\" in ruling out a cull. NFU president, Bedfordshire farmer\nPeter Kendall and vice president Meurig Raymond, who farms in\nPembrokeshire, led a demonstration outside the House of Parliament after Mr\nBenn's announcement. Mr Kendall said the NFU would mount a legal challenge\nand withdraw from talks on cost and responsibility sharing. The Tenant\nFarmers Association (TFA) has also pulled out of talks on sharing the costs\nand responsibilities of animal diseases, which it describes as\n\"hypocritical and damaging\" without controls of bTB in wildlife.\n\n[byline: Steve Dube]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] UK (Scotland): badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Fri 18 Jul 2008\nSource: Business Scotsman [edited]\n<http://business.scotsman.com/fooddrinkagriculture/TB-outbreak--raises-fears.4301536.jp>\n\n\nTB outbreak raises fears of ban on UK calves\n--------------------------------------------\nThere appears to be a real possibility that the export of young bull calves\nfrom dairy herds in the UK to mainland Europe may be banned following the\ndiscovery to bovine tuberculosis on 27 farms in the Netherlands.\n\nA dairy herd in England, previously free from TB, has suffered a breakdown\nand it is believed that calves from this farm are the source of the\nproblem, which was discovered during routine testing.\n\nAbout 400 000 calves are exported at around 10 days of age from the UK for\nveal production. These must come from TB-free farms. However, there is no\nreliable test for TB in animals that are aged less than 42 days.\n\nIn certain parts of the European Union, there is a view that the UK is a\nreservoir of disease: first BSE in 1996, then the world's largest epidemic\nof foot and mouth disease in 2001 followed by a smaller outbreak of the\nsame disease last year [2007].\n\nThe vast majority of farmers and many leading scientists assert there is a\nclear link between TB and badgers, which are deemed to be the principal\nvector of this disease.\n\nThe latest forecast is that up to 40 000 cattle in England will be culled\nduring 2008. Only last week Hilary Benn, the secretary of state at DEFRA\n(UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs), ruled out a cull\nof badgers. He said that a cull of badgers \"could end up making the disease\nworse if it was not sustained over time or delivered effectively and public\nopposition, including the unwillingness of some landowners to take part,\nwould render this more difficult.\"\n\nJeff Rooker, a junior minister at DEFRA, is of a different opinion.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords he said: \"Badger-to-cattle transmission is\nheavy. It accounts for 70-80 per cent [of] cases.\"\n\n[byline: Dan Buglass]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Ireland: badger cull policy discussed\nDate: Thu 17 Jul 2008\nSource: Farmers Weekly Interactive [edited]\n<http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/07/17/111222/badger-cull-has-desired-effect-in-ireland.html>\n\n\nBadger cull has desired effect in Ireland\n-----------------------------------------\nThe incidence of bovine TB in the Republic of Ireland continues to decline,\nas the department of agriculture in Dublin presses on with its cull of\ninfected badgers. A government spokeswoman explained that, even though\nthere had been a slight increase in 2007, this was because the level of\ntesting had increased substantially following the opening of a new\nlaboratory in Sligo. Slaughterhouse inspection procedures had also\nimproved. \"With TB you should never look at one year in isolation, as there\nare so many pieces that go together,\" she said. \"It's best to look at 5\nyear trends and that shows a steady fall in TB.\"\n\nFor example, in 1998 the number of TB reactors came to 45 000, but by 2003\nhad dropped to 28 000. In 2006 there was a further fall to 24 000, though\nlast year [2007] it was up to 28 000. Disease incidence stands at about 6\nper cent of herds tested, compared with 8.2 per cent in the peak year of 2000.\n\nThe Irish government is adamant that badger culling is a key factor in\ncontaining the disease. \"Elsewhere in the world, the tuberculin test\nprovides all the control necessary to get on top of TB. Only in Ireland and\nGB, where there is also a wildlife challenge, is there a problem.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, for example, TB had been contained when possums -- the\ncommon vector -- were culled, while in Australia it was wild buffalo that\nhad been taken out.\n\nBadger culling is strictly controlled in the Republic of Ireland. It is\nonly triggered where, following an outbreak, an epidemiological study\nimplicates badgers as the likely source, not cattle. The spokeswoman\ninsisted there was no plan to cull out all the badgers in an area -- merely\nto reduce the population and so reduce contact opportunities, until a\nvaccine was available. She also explained that, unlike in GB, there was no\nproblem with perturbation. \"It seems our badger populations are quite\ndifferent,\" she said. \"They have different diets, different reproduction,\nand different densities. Their social groups are smaller and they are less\nterritorial.\"\n\nThe government has a self-imposed cap of culling on just 30 per cent of the\nagricultural area. So far it has covered about 20 per cent, taking out\nabout 2 thirds of the badgers in that area. About half of these were TB\ninfected.\n\nFarmers contribute to the cost of the programme with a statutory levy on\nmilk sales, and on cattle slaughtered or exported.\n\n[byline: Philip Clarke]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional information on the recent bovine tuberculosis developments in\nEngland, which -- according to available science-based information -- is\ndirectly related to the infection in badgers, can be found at\n<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4340286.ece>.\n\nDEFRA's explanatory information is available at\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm>.\n\nThe number of new outbreaks in cattle during 2007, as reported to the OIE\n(World Organisation for Animal Health), was: England -- 3153(!); Wales --\n902; Scotland -- 58.

The state has now detected bovine TB in 8 beef herds\nin Roseau and Beltrami counties. While the infections pose little risk to\nhuman health, the latest discovery slows the industry in its effort to\nregain the crucial \"TB-free\" status, the board said.\n\nThe Beltrami County herd was quarantined last year [2006] after a TB\ninvestigation revealed the owner had bought animals from a TB-infected\nfarm. The entire herd was tested at that time, and all animals tested\nnegative. But in a follow-up test this fall [2007], 2 animals tested\n\"suspect\" for bovine TB. Tissue samples were submitted to the National\nVeterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, and bovine TB was confirmed\nin a 12 month old beef heifer Tuesday [23 Oct 2007]. The 2nd animal was\nnegative.\n\nThat herd numbered about 350. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is\nworking with the herd operator to have the animals put down and then\narrange compensation, the state board said.\n\nThe state's cattle herds will be declared free of TB only after 2 years\npass without a positive test. Losing the \"TB-free\" label poses a cumbersome\nfinancial burden for ranchers, who must then pay for testing if they want\nto sell their animals outside of the state.\n\nThis latest discovery means the industry must start over toward having 2\nyears of being TB-free. It had been about a year into achieving that status\nbefore this positive test, said Board of Animal Health spokeswoman Malissa\nFritz.\n\nThe state's cattle herd health status took its initial hit in January 2006,\nwhen the USDA said Minnesota cows were no longer considered free of\ntuberculosis. That decision came after the discovery of 5 infected herds in\nnorth western Minnesota.\n\nIn a statement issued today [25 Oct 2007], Dr Bill Hartmann, state\nveterinarian and Board of Animal Health executive director said: \"Finding\nanother positive herd will reset our time line for regaining status, but\nfor the sake of Minnesota's cattle industry, we cannot leave a single\ninfected herd undiscovered.\"\n\nIn addition to traces and area testing, the state is conducting TB testing\nin cattle herds statewide. This statewide surveillance began before\ndiscovery of this latest infected herd and is expected to be complete by\nthe end of the year [2007].

The state has now detected bovine TB in 8 beef herds\nin Roseau and Beltrami counties. While the infections pose little risk to\nhuman health, the latest discovery slows the industry in its effort to\nregain the crucial \"TB-free\" status, the board said.\n\nThe Beltrami County herd was quarantined last year [2006] after a TB\ninvestigation revealed the owner had bought animals from a TB-infected\nfarm. The entire herd was tested at that time, and all animals tested\nnegative. But in a follow-up test this fall [2007], 2 animals tested\n\"suspect\" for bovine TB.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is\nworking with the herd operator to have the animals put down and then\narrange compensation, the state board said.\n\nThe state's cattle herds will be declared free of TB only after 2 years\npass without a positive test. Losing the \"TB-free\" label poses a cumbersome\nfinancial burden for ranchers, who must then pay for testing if they want\nto sell their animals outside of the state.\n\nThis latest discovery means the industry must start over toward having 2\nyears of being TB-free. It had been about a year into achieving that status\nbefore this positive test, said Board of Animal Health spokeswoman Malissa\nFritz.\n\nThe state's cattle herd health status took its initial hit in January 2006,\nwhen the USDA said Minnesota cows were no longer considered free of\ntuberculosis. That decision came after the discovery of 5 infected herds in\nnorth western Minnesota.\n\nIn a statement issued today [25 Oct 2007], Dr Bill Hartmann, state\nveterinarian and Board of Animal Health executive director said: \"Finding\nanother positive herd will reset our time line for regaining status, but\nfor the sake of Minnesota's cattle industry, we cannot leave a single\ninfected herd undiscovered.\"\n\nIn addition to traces and area testing, the state is conducting TB testing\nin cattle herds statewide.

The woman,\nwhose identity and job position hospital officials wouldn't provide,\nis thought to have been contagious for only a few days or not at all,\nsaid Dr. Dennis Maki, an infectious disease specialist at UW Hospital.\nThough TB can be spread through the air, it generally requires close,\nprolonged contact, Maki said. It would take about 6 months for most\npeople who were exposed to develop active disease, he said. Maki said\nit's too early to know if the woman has multidrug-resistant TB [MDR],\nwhich is more of a public health threat. Tests to determine that\ncould take another few weeks. \"The people probably at greatest risk\nare the other health-care workers she has worked closely with the\nlast 2 months,\" Maki said. Those people are getting skin tests this\nweek, he said. Any of them who test positive will be given\nantibiotics to prevent the development of active disease.\nFor patients, dozens of whom will be sought out soon by their doctors\nfor skin tests, \"I don't think there's any reason for them to be\nconcerned,\" Maki said.\nThe woman, whose routine annual skin test for TB was negative in\nNovember [2006], became ill about 3 weeks ago, he said. She didn't\nhave a cough or other respiratory symptoms typical of TB, he said.\nHer main complaint was abdominal pain, for which she underwent\nsurgery last week [20-26 Aug 2007], he said. During the surgery,\nabnormal tissue samples raised suspicion of TB, Maki said. After\nsurgery, he said, the woman was put in an isolation room, with\nnegative air pressure to contain germs and rules requiring workers to\nwear special masks. She was given antibiotics. A few days later, lab\nresults from the tissue samples were positive for TB, Maki said. The\nwoman then underwent the definitive test for TB, of her sputum. It\nwas positive. The woman returned home Tuesday [28 Aug 2007] and is\nrecovering well, Maki said. She will be on antibiotics for several months.\nMaki and other officials said they wouldn't identify her or her\nposition because of privacy laws. Because the woman didn't have the\ntypical symptoms of TB, notably a cough that could easily spread the\ndisease, she probably wasn't contagious, Maki said. \"If she was\ncontagious, it was probably only in the last days before she was\ndiagnosed,\" he said.\nSkin test results on her co-workers should come back by next week\n[3-9 Sep 2007]. If they are negative, it probably means she wasn't\ncontagious to anyone, though follow-up tests will still be performed,\nMaki said. Other co-workers who don't work with her as closely will\nbe screened for TB during this year's [2007] annual skin tests this\nfall, he said. Nearly 5000 people work at both hospitals. Letters\nwill go out next week to the primary care doctors of up to 150\npatients who may have been exposed, Maki said.\nDane County had 9 cases of active TB last year [2006], said Julie\nHalvorsen, a nursing supervisor with the Madison-Dane County Health\nDepartment. The county has had 4 cases this year [2007], including\nthe UW Hospital worker.\n[Byline: David Wahlberg]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A map of Wisconsin can be found at\n<http://www.wistravel.com/map_of_wisconsin/>.\nMadison is the capital of the US state of Wisconsin and the county\nseat of Dane County. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nTransmission of tuberculosis depends on the infectivity of the\npatient, ventilation of the space in which exposure takes place, and\nduration of exposure. Usually infectious patients have cavitary\ntuberculosis and are coughing or sneezing that generates a large\nquantity of aerosols that contain tubercle bacilli. This degree of\ninfectivity is indicated by a positive smear of sputum stained\nspecifically for mycobacteria (acid fast or AFB (acid-fast bacillus)\nsmear). Prolonged, close contact in poorly ventilated spaces enhances\ntransmission.\nTuberculosis has long been known to be a risk for health care\nworkers. Indeed, we published an extensive outbreak of latent and\nactive tuberculosis in an academic medical center in 1965 (N Engl J\nMed 1965; 275: 718-21); hospital outbreaks of TB occurred in the\n1980's among AIDS patients and healthcare workers, and hospital\noutbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB occurred in the 1990's.\nHospital employees with patient contact are tuberculin skin tested at\nleast annually to assess recent acquisition of tuberculosis. If the\nhospital employee in the news release above was tested annually for\nmany years and the tuberculin skin test had been consistently\nnegative, followed by a positive one year later, then the positive\ntuberculin reaction would be the result of an infection acquired\nwithin the prior year. The rapid progression in hospital employee in\nthe above news release from latent infection acquired less than 6-8\nweeks before or at some time after her negative skin test in November\n2006 to extra-pulmonary disease suggests some degree of\nimmunosuppression. We are not told of any co-morbidities in this\nhospital worker.\nHowever, if she were 1st employed the prior year and had not been\ntuberculin skin tested before, an initial negative tuberculin test\nmay represent tuberculin hypersensitivity that has waned over the\nyears after latent tuberculosis that was acquired in childhood. The\ninitial tuberculin skin test, although negative at the time, can\nnevertheless stimulate the waned hypersensitivity to tuberculin. This\nboosted hypersensitivity can develop within several days of testing\nand persist. A subsequent positive tuberculin test then may be either\nthe result of a newly acquired infection or the \"booster effect\". A\nbooster effect can be assessed in someone who will undergo annual\ntesting, such as a hospital employee, by repeat testing one week\nafter an initial negative test; if the 2nd test is positive, the\nreaction is due to the booster effect.\nThe hospital worker in the news release was suspected to have\nintra-abdominal tuberculosis on visual exam of the tissues during\nabdominal surgery. The exact intra-abdominal site is not specified;\nit could be intestine, lymph node, peritoneum, or a visceral organ.\nThe lab tests, which were said to be \"positive\" a few days after\nsurgery, may have been a positive smear for acid-fast bacilli, but\nthe acid-fast organism could be _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or\nnon-tuberculous mycobacteria. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests\nare available for rapid laboratory diagnosis of _M. tuberculosis_ on\nrespiratory specimens, but I don't believe they have been as yet\nFDA-approved for non-respiratory specimens -- although some specialty\nlabs will do a NAA test on non-respiratory specimens. The news\nrelease says that the patient then had a \"definitive\" positive test\nfor TB on her sputum; a positive NAA test on sputum, although rapid,\nis only presumptive of TB\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4926a3.htm>); the\ndefinitive test is a culture, but cultures require at least 2 weeks.\nWe are told that the hospital worker was thought to be \"contagious\nfor only a few days or not at all\" because she had no cough, but we\ndon't know her chest X-ray findings, nor do we know for sure if her\nsputum smears were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Certainly if she\nhad been coughing and producing sputum that was acid-fast bacilli\nsmear-positive with pulmonary cavities seen on chest X-ray, she would\nbe considered to be contagious.\nWe also don't know the status of her family or other household\ncontacts. If she has children who are skin test tuberculin-positive,\neither she or someone else in her household is likely contagious. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (03) 20070731.2462\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (02) 20070728.2430\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry 20070727.2418\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (04) 20070609.1888\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (03) 20070601.1778\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (02) 20070530.1752\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (USA, France,\nCanada, Czech Rep.) 20070529.1738\n2005\n----\nTuberculosis, hospital exposures - USA (MA) 20050616.1702\nTuberculosis - Iraq (Missan) 20050613.1652\nTuberculosis, nursery school - Spain (Catalonia) 20050523.1416\nTuberculosis, supermarket exposure - Netherlands (Zeist) (03) 20050225.0602\nTuberculosis, supermarket exposure - Netherlands (Zeist) 20050207.0411\n........................................ml/mj/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The woman,\nwhose identity and job position hospital officials wouldn't provide,\nis thought to have been contagious for only a few days or not at all,\nsaid Dr. Dennis Maki, an infectious disease specialist at UW Hospital.\nThough TB can be spread through the air, it generally requires close,\nprolonged contact, Maki said. It would take about 6 months for most\npeople who were exposed to develop active disease, he said. Maki said\nit's too early to know if the woman has multidrug-resistant TB [MDR],\nwhich is more of a public health threat. Tests to determine that\ncould take another few weeks. \"The people probably at greatest risk\nare the other health-care workers she has worked closely with the\nlast 2 months,\" Maki said. Those people are getting skin tests this\nweek, he said. Any of them who test positive will be given\nantibiotics to prevent the development of active disease.\nFor patients, dozens of whom will be sought out soon by their doctors\nfor skin tests, \"I don't think there's any reason for them to be\nconcerned,\" Maki said.\nThe woman, whose routine annual skin test for TB was negative in\nNovember [2006], became ill about 3 weeks ago, he said. She didn't\nhave a cough or other respiratory symptoms typical of TB, he said.\nHer main complaint was abdominal pain, for which she underwent\nsurgery last week [20-26 Aug 2007], he said. During the surgery,\nabnormal tissue samples raised suspicion of TB, Maki said. After\nsurgery, he said, the woman was put in an isolation room, with\nnegative air pressure to contain germs and rules requiring workers to\nwear special masks. She was given antibiotics. A few days later, lab\nresults from the tissue samples were positive for TB, Maki said. The\nwoman then underwent the definitive test for TB, of her sputum. It\nwas positive. The woman returned home Tuesday [28 Aug 2007] and is\nrecovering well, Maki said. She will be on antibiotics for several months.\nMaki and other officials said they wouldn't identify her or her\nposition because of privacy laws. Because the woman didn't have the\ntypical symptoms of TB, notably a cough that could easily spread the\ndisease, she probably wasn't contagious, Maki said. \"If she was\ncontagious, it was probably only in the last days before she was\ndiagnosed,\" he said.\nSkin test results on her co-workers should come back by next week\n[3-9 Sep 2007]. If they are negative, it probably means she wasn't\ncontagious to anyone, though follow-up tests will still be performed,\nMaki said. Other co-workers who don't work with her as closely will\nbe screened for TB during this year's [2007] annual skin tests this\nfall, he said. Nearly 5000 people work at both hospitals. Letters\nwill go out next week to the primary care doctors of up to 150\npatients who may have been exposed, Maki said.\nDane County had 9 cases of active TB last year [2006], said Julie\nHalvorsen, a nursing supervisor with the Madison-Dane County Health\nDepartment. The county has had 4 cases this year [2007], including\nthe UW Hospital worker.\n[Byline: David Wahlberg]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A map of Wisconsin can be found at\n<http://www.wistravel.com/map_of_wisconsin/>.\nMadison is the capital of the US state of Wisconsin and the county\nseat of Dane County. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nTransmission of tuberculosis depends on the infectivity of the\npatient, ventilation of the space in which exposure takes place, and\nduration of exposure. Usually infectious patients have cavitary\ntuberculosis and are coughing or sneezing that generates a large\nquantity of aerosols that contain tubercle bacilli. This degree of\ninfectivity is indicated by a positive smear of sputum stained\nspecifically for mycobacteria (acid fast or AFB (acid-fast bacillus)\nsmear). Prolonged, close contact in poorly ventilated spaces enhances\ntransmission.\nTuberculosis has long been known to be a risk for health care\nworkers. Indeed, we published an extensive outbreak of latent and\nactive tuberculosis in an academic medical center in 1965 (N Engl J\nMed 1965; 275: 718-21); hospital outbreaks of TB occurred in the\n1980's among AIDS patients and healthcare workers, and hospital\noutbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB occurred in the 1990's.\nHospital employees with patient contact are tuberculin skin tested at\nleast annually to assess recent acquisition of tuberculosis. If the\nhospital employee in the news release above was tested annually for\nmany years and the tuberculin skin test had been consistently\nnegative, followed by a positive one year later, then the positive\ntuberculin reaction would be the result of an infection acquired\nwithin the prior year. The rapid progression in hospital employee in\nthe above news release from latent infection acquired less than 6-8\nweeks before or at some time after her negative skin test in November\n2006 to extra-pulmonary disease suggests some degree of\nimmunosuppression. We are not told of any co-morbidities in this\nhospital worker.\nHowever, if she were 1st employed the prior year and had not been\ntuberculin skin tested before, an initial negative tuberculin test\nmay represent tuberculin hypersensitivity that has waned over the\nyears after latent tuberculosis that was acquired in childhood. The\ninitial tuberculin skin test, although negative at the time, can\nnevertheless stimulate the waned hypersensitivity to tuberculin. This\nboosted hypersensitivity can develop within several days of testing\nand persist. A subsequent positive tuberculin test then may be either\nthe result of a newly acquired infection or the \"booster effect\". A\nbooster effect can be assessed in someone who will undergo annual\ntesting, such as a hospital employee, by repeat testing one week\nafter an initial negative test; if the 2nd test is positive, the\nreaction is due to the booster effect.\nThe hospital worker in the news release was suspected to have\nintra-abdominal tuberculosis on visual exam of the tissues during\nabdominal surgery. The exact intra-abdominal site is not specified;\nit could be intestine, lymph node, peritoneum, or a visceral organ.\nThe lab tests, which were said to be \"positive\" a few days after\nsurgery, may have been a positive smear for acid-fast bacilli, but\nthe acid-fast organism could be _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or\nnon-tuberculous mycobacteria.

The woman,\nwhose identity and job position hospital officials wouldn't provide,\nis thought to have been contagious for only a few days or not at all,\nsaid Dr. Dennis Maki, an infectious disease specialist at UW Hospital.\nThough TB can be spread through the air, it generally requires close,\nprolonged contact, Maki said. It would take about 6 months for most\npeople who were exposed to develop active disease, he said. Maki said\nit's too early to know if the woman has multidrug-resistant TB [MDR],\nwhich is more of a public health threat. Tests to determine that\ncould take another few weeks. \"The people probably at greatest risk\nare the other health-care workers she has worked closely with the\nlast 2 months,\" Maki said. Those people are getting skin tests this\nweek, he said. Any of them who test positive will be given\nantibiotics to prevent the development of active disease.\nFor patients, dozens of whom will be sought out soon by their doctors\nfor skin tests, \"I don't think there's any reason for them to be\nconcerned,\" Maki said.\nThe woman, whose routine annual skin test for TB was negative in\nNovember [2006], became ill about 3 weeks ago, he said. She didn't\nhave a cough or other respiratory symptoms typical of TB, he said.\nHer main complaint was abdominal pain, for which she underwent\nsurgery last week [20-26 Aug 2007], he said. During the surgery,\nabnormal tissue samples raised suspicion of TB, Maki said. After\nsurgery, he said, the woman was put in an isolation room, with\nnegative air pressure to contain germs and rules requiring workers to\nwear special masks. She was given antibiotics. A few days later, lab\nresults from the tissue samples were positive for TB, Maki said. The\nwoman then underwent the definitive test for TB, of her sputum. It\nwas positive. The woman returned home Tuesday [28 Aug 2007] and is\nrecovering well, Maki said. She will be on antibiotics for several months.\nMaki and other officials said they wouldn't identify her or her\nposition because of privacy laws. Because the woman didn't have the\ntypical symptoms of TB, notably a cough that could easily spread the\ndisease, she probably wasn't contagious, Maki said. \"If she was\ncontagious, it was probably only in the last days before she was\ndiagnosed,\" he said.\nSkin test results on her co-workers should come back by next week\n[3-9 Sep 2007]. If they are negative, it probably means she wasn't\ncontagious to anyone, though follow-up tests will still be performed,\nMaki said. Other co-workers who don't work with her as closely will\nbe screened for TB during this year's [2007] annual skin tests this\nfall, he said. Nearly 5000 people work at both hospitals. Letters\nwill go out next week to the primary care doctors of up to 150\npatients who may have been exposed, Maki said.\nDane County had 9 cases of active TB last year [2006], said Julie\nHalvorsen, a nursing supervisor with the Madison-Dane County Health\nDepartment. The county has had 4 cases this year [2007], including\nthe UW Hospital worker.\n[Byline: David Wahlberg]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A map of Wisconsin can be found at\n<http://www.wistravel.com/map_of_wisconsin/>.\nMadison is the capital of the US state of Wisconsin and the county\nseat of Dane County. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nTransmission of tuberculosis depends on the infectivity of the\npatient, ventilation of the space in which exposure takes place, and\nduration of exposure. Usually infectious patients have cavitary\ntuberculosis and are coughing or sneezing that generates a large\nquantity of aerosols that contain tubercle bacilli. This degree of\ninfectivity is indicated by a positive smear of sputum stained\nspecifically for mycobacteria (acid fast or AFB (acid-fast bacillus)\nsmear). Prolonged, close contact in poorly ventilated spaces enhances\ntransmission.\nTuberculosis has long been known to be a risk for health care\nworkers. Indeed, we published an extensive outbreak of latent and\nactive tuberculosis in an academic medical center in 1965 (N Engl J\nMed 1965; 275: 718-21); hospital outbreaks of TB occurred in the\n1980's among AIDS patients and healthcare workers, and hospital\noutbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB occurred in the 1990's.\nHospital employees with patient contact are tuberculin skin tested at\nleast annually to assess recent acquisition of tuberculosis. If the\nhospital employee in the news release above was tested annually for\nmany years and the tuberculin skin test had been consistently\nnegative, followed by a positive one year later, then the positive\ntuberculin reaction would be the result of an infection acquired\nwithin the prior year. The rapid progression in hospital employee in\nthe above news release from latent infection acquired less than 6-8\nweeks before or at some time after her negative skin test in November\n2006 to extra-pulmonary disease suggests some degree of\nimmunosuppression. We are not told of any co-morbidities in this\nhospital worker.\nHowever, if she were 1st employed the prior year and had not been\ntuberculin skin tested before, an initial negative tuberculin test\nmay represent tuberculin hypersensitivity that has waned over the\nyears after latent tuberculosis that was acquired in childhood. The\ninitial tuberculin skin test, although negative at the time, can\nnevertheless stimulate the waned hypersensitivity to tuberculin. This\nboosted hypersensitivity can develop within several days of testing\nand persist. A subsequent positive tuberculin test then may be either\nthe result of a newly acquired infection or the \"booster effect\". A\nbooster effect can be assessed in someone who will undergo annual\ntesting, such as a hospital employee, by repeat testing one week\nafter an initial negative test; if the 2nd test is positive, the\nreaction is due to the booster effect.\nThe hospital worker in the news release was suspected to have\nintra-abdominal tuberculosis on visual exam of the tissues during\nabdominal surgery. The exact intra-abdominal site is not specified;\nit could be intestine, lymph node, peritoneum, or a visceral organ.\nThe lab tests, which were said to be \"positive\" a few days after\nsurgery, may have been a positive smear for acid-fast bacilli, but\nthe acid-fast organism could be _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or\nnon-tuberculous mycobacteria. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests\nare available for rapid laboratory diagnosis of _M. tuberculosis_ on\nrespiratory specimens, but I don't believe they have been as yet\nFDA-approved for non-respiratory specimens -- although some specialty\nlabs will do a NAA test on non-respiratory specimens. The news\nrelease says that the patient then had a \"definitive\" positive test\nfor TB on her sputum; a positive NAA test on sputum, although rapid,\nis only presumptive of TB\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4926a3.htm>); the\ndefinitive test is a culture, but cultures require at least 2 weeks.\nWe are told that the hospital worker was thought to be \"contagious\nfor only a few days or not at all\" because she had no cough, but we\ndon't know her chest X-ray findings, nor do we know for sure if her\nsputum smears were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Certainly if she\nhad been coughing and producing sputum that was acid-fast bacilli\nsmear-positive with pulmonary cavities seen on chest X-ray, she would\nbe considered to be contagious.\nWe also don't know the status of her family or other household\ncontacts. If she has children who are skin test tuberculin-positive,\neither she or someone else in her household is likely contagious. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (03) 20070731.2462\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (02) 20070728.2430\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry 20070727.2418\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (04) 20070609.1888\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (03) 20070601.1778\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (02) 20070530.1752\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (USA, France,\nCanada, Czech Rep.) 20070529.1738\n2005\n----\nTuberculosis, hospital exposures - USA (MA) 20050616.1702\nTuberculosis - Iraq (Missan) 20050613.1652\nTuberculosis, nursery school - Spain (Catalonia) 20050523.1416\nTuberculosis, supermarket exposure - Netherlands (Zeist) (03) 20050225.0602\nTuberculosis, supermarket exposure - Netherlands (Zeist) 20050207.0411\n........................................ml/mj/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Because the woman didn't have the\ntypical symptoms of TB, notably a cough that could easily spread the\ndisease, she probably wasn't contagious, Maki said. \"If she was\ncontagious, it was probably only in the last days before she was\ndiagnosed,\" he said.\nSkin test results on her co-workers should come back by next week\n[3-9 Sep 2007]. If they are negative, it probably means she wasn't\ncontagious to anyone, though follow-up tests will still be performed,\nMaki said. Other co-workers who don't work with her as closely will\nbe screened for TB during this year's [2007] annual skin tests this\nfall, he said. Nearly 5000 people work at both hospitals. Letters\nwill go out next week to the primary care doctors of up to 150\npatients who may have been exposed, Maki said.\nDane County had 9 cases of active TB last year [2006], said Julie\nHalvorsen, a nursing supervisor with the Madison-Dane County Health\nDepartment. The county has had 4 cases this year [2007], including\nthe UW Hospital worker.\n[Byline: David Wahlberg]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A map of Wisconsin can be found at\n<http://www.wistravel.com/map_of_wisconsin/>.\nMadison is the capital of the US state of Wisconsin and the county\nseat of Dane County. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nTransmission of tuberculosis depends on the infectivity of the\npatient, ventilation of the space in which exposure takes place, and\nduration of exposure. Usually infectious patients have cavitary\ntuberculosis and are coughing or sneezing that generates a large\nquantity of aerosols that contain tubercle bacilli. This degree of\ninfectivity is indicated by a positive smear of sputum stained\nspecifically for mycobacteria (acid fast or AFB (acid-fast bacillus)\nsmear). Prolonged, close contact in poorly ventilated spaces enhances\ntransmission.\nTuberculosis has long been known to be a risk for health care\nworkers. Indeed, we published an extensive outbreak of latent and\nactive tuberculosis in an academic medical center in 1965 (N Engl J\nMed 1965; 275: 718-21); hospital outbreaks of TB occurred in the\n1980's among AIDS patients and healthcare workers, and hospital\noutbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB occurred in the 1990's.\nHospital employees with patient contact are tuberculin skin tested at\nleast annually to assess recent acquisition of tuberculosis. If the\nhospital employee in the news release above was tested annually for\nmany years and the tuberculin skin test had been consistently\nnegative, followed by a positive one year later, then the positive\ntuberculin reaction would be the result of an infection acquired\nwithin the prior year. The rapid progression in hospital employee in\nthe above news release from latent infection acquired less than 6-8\nweeks before or at some time after her negative skin test in November\n2006 to extra-pulmonary disease suggests some degree of\nimmunosuppression. We are not told of any co-morbidities in this\nhospital worker.\nHowever, if she were 1st employed the prior year and had not been\ntuberculin skin tested before, an initial negative tuberculin test\nmay represent tuberculin hypersensitivity that has waned over the\nyears after latent tuberculosis that was acquired in childhood. The\ninitial tuberculin skin test, although negative at the time, can\nnevertheless stimulate the waned hypersensitivity to tuberculin. This\nboosted hypersensitivity can develop within several days of testing\nand persist. A subsequent positive tuberculin test then may be either\nthe result of a newly acquired infection or the \"booster effect\". A\nbooster effect can be assessed in someone who will undergo annual\ntesting, such as a hospital employee, by repeat testing one week\nafter an initial negative test; if the 2nd test is positive, the\nreaction is due to the booster effect.\nThe hospital worker in the news release was suspected to have\nintra-abdominal tuberculosis on visual exam of the tissues during\nabdominal surgery. The exact intra-abdominal site is not specified;\nit could be intestine, lymph node, peritoneum, or a visceral organ.\nThe lab tests, which were said to be \"positive\" a few days after\nsurgery, may have been a positive smear for acid-fast bacilli, but\nthe acid-fast organism could be _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or\nnon-tuberculous mycobacteria. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests\nare available for rapid laboratory diagnosis of _M. tuberculosis_ on\nrespiratory specimens, but I don't believe they have been as yet\nFDA-approved for non-respiratory specimens -- although some specialty\nlabs will do a NAA test on non-respiratory specimens. The news\nrelease says that the patient then had a \"definitive\" positive test\nfor TB on her sputum; a positive NAA test on sputum, although rapid,\nis only presumptive of TB\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4926a3.htm>); the\ndefinitive test is a culture, but cultures require at least 2 weeks.\nWe are told that the hospital worker was thought to be \"contagious\nfor only a few days or not at all\" because she had no cough, but we\ndon't know her chest X-ray findings, nor do we know for sure if her\nsputum smears were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Certainly if she\nhad been coughing and producing sputum that was acid-fast bacilli\nsmear-positive with pulmonary cavities seen on chest X-ray, she would\nbe considered to be contagious.\nWe also don't know the status of her family or other household\ncontacts. If she has children who are skin test tuberculin-positive,\neither she or someone else in her household is likely contagious. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (03) 20070731.2462\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (02) 20070728.2430\nTuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry 20070727.2418\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (04) 20070609.1888\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (03) 20070601.1778\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (02) 20070530.1752\nTuberculosis, XDR, airplane exposure - multicountry (USA, France,\nCanada, Czech Rep.) 20070529.1738\n2005\n----\nTuberculosis, hospital exposures - USA (MA) 20050616.1702\nTuberculosis - Iraq (Missan) 20050613.1652\nTuberculosis, nursery school - Spain (Catalonia) 20050523.1416\nTuberculosis, supermarket exposure - Netherlands (Zeist) (03) 20050225.0602\nTuberculosis, supermarket exposure - Netherlands (Zeist) 20050207.0411\n........................................ml/mj/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Frankel,\nM.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., Emeritus Professor of Medicine, University of\nHawaii: \"It would be useful to know what is meant by the statement\n\"the elephants have tested positive for TB...\" Are these elephants\nill, and was that the reason for testing? Were they tested by skin\ntest or by some other means? Do they have latent infection or\ntuberculosis disease?\"\nThe following firsthand response has been received from Dr Susan Mikota]:\n\nIn January 2006, a study was conducted by Dr. Kamal Giri in\nfulfillment of his MvSc. degree at the Institute of Agriculture and\nAnimal Science. Dr. Giri's work was assisted by Elephant Care\nInternational and Tufts Center for Conservation Medicine. TB has been\nobserved postmortem and anecdotally reported in Nepal, India, and\nother Asian countries. This was the 1st comprehensive evaluation of\nrange country elephants for TB.\nIn addition to collecting trunk wash samples (which were cultured at\nthe National Tuberculosis Lab in Nepal and the National Veterinary\nServices Lab in the U.S.), we collected blood for several serological\nTB assays: (ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK, multi-antigen print\nimmunoassay (MAPIA), and immunoblot, as well as for CBCs, serum\nchemistries, and an immune profile. The determination of which\nelephants were positive or considered to be at risk to develop active\nTB was made by evaluating all of the data with particular attention\ngiven to the ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA tests, which we\nhave found to be useful to diagnose TB among elephants in the U.S. A\nfull report was given to the government of Nepal.\nWe do not use skin testing in elephants because it is not accurate\n(see Lewerin, S.S. et al, 2005. Outbreak of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection among captive Asian elephants in a Swedish\nzoo. Vet Rec. 156(6):171-175 and also Mikota, S.K. et al, 2001.\nEpidemiology & Diagnosis of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in captive\nAsian elephants (_Elephas maximus_). Journal of Zoo and Wildlife\nMedicine 32(1):1-16).\nElephants that are culture positive clearly have active TB. We don't\nreally know whether elephants develop latent disease or whether we\nsimply fail to detect active disease because of the limitations of\nour diagnostic techniques. We cannot X-ray adult elephants.\nCulture has inherent limitations as a primary diagnostic technique.\nFailure to isolate the organism does not rule out infection.\nReporting time is slow (up to 8 weeks) because pathogenic\nmycobacteria may grow slowly. The trunk wash method of sample\ncollection results in variable sample quality. Overgrowth due to\ncontamination from trunk wash samples occurs and may compromise the\nreliability of culture results, especially if overgrowth is not\nreported.\nObtaining 3 samples may not be practical or affordable for screening\nlarge numbers of elephants in Asia, where surveillance is urgently\nneeded.\nSerological tests that have been under investigation in the U.S. have\nshown great promise for improving our ability to diagnose TB in\nelephants.\nThe Elephant TB STAT-PAK is a lateral-flow assay that incorporates a\nunique cocktail of mycobacterial antigens impregnated on a\nnitrocellulose membrane and placed in a plastic cassette similar to a\npregnancy test kit. Serum, plasma, or whole blood may be used and\nresults are available in 20 minutes (see Lyashchenko, K.P. et al,\n2006. Tuberculosis in elephants: antibody responses to defined\nantigens of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, potential for early\ndiagnosis, and monitoring of treatment. Clin Vaccine Immunol\n13(7):722-732, and Lyashchenko, K. et al, 2005. Application of MAPIA\n(Multiple antigen print immunoassay) and rapid lateral flow\ntechnology for tuberculosis testing of elephants. 2005 Proceedings\nAAZV, AAWV, AZA Nutrition Advisory Group, pp. 64-65).\nThe MAPIA is a laboratory procedure for antibody detection that uses\na panel of multiple purified and recombinant antigens of _M.\ntuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ that are separately applied to a\nnitrocellulose membrane using an automated printing device (see\nLyashchenko, K. et al., 2000. Multi-antigen print immunoassay for the\ndevelopment of serological diagnosis of infectious disease. Journal\nof Immunological Methods 242:91-100).\nExcluding the data from Nepal, approximately 99 Asian and 72 African\nelephants in Europe, Australia, South Africa, and the U.S. have been\ntested using the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA, including 22\nelephants with culture-confirmed TB. Preliminary data has\ndemonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity for\nthe Elephant TB STAT-PAK and 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent\nspecificity for the MAPIA using culture as the reference standard.\nThe TB STAT-PAK has recently completed government licensing\nprocedures in the U.S. and will likely be commercially available\nlater this year [2007].\nIf the Elephant TB STAT-PAK is used as a screening test and the MAPIA\nis sequentially applied as a confirmatory assay, the accuracy of this\ntesting algorithm is 100 percent. Seroconversion on Elephant TB\nSTAT-PAK and MAPIA has been noted in several elephants months to\nyears prior to a positive culture (Lyashchenko 2006). In one elephant\nthat was euthanized and determined to be TB positive, retrospective\nevaluation of serum indicated seroconversion 8 years [earlier].\nA study by Dr. Scott Larsen (U.C. Davis) and Dr. Mo Salman (U. of\nColorado) using a 6-antigen ELISA demonstrated an estimated\nsensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 100 percent, on a\nsample size of 47 Asian and African elephants (7 culture positive)\n(see Larsen, R.S., et al. 2000. Evaluation of a multiple-antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection in captive elephants. Journal of Zoo and\nWildlife Medicine 31(3): 291-302).\nThe ELISA continues to be evaluated but is not available commercially.\nAn important advantage of TB serodiagnosis compared to trunk wash\nculture is that, once established, the antibody response remains\nsustained throughout infection and disease, while culture may be\nintermittently positive or negative in infected elephants. A decline\nin specific antibodies to certain antigens in MAPIA has been observed\nin 7 culture positive elephants tested to date that had undergone\ntreatment, suggesting that this technology may also be a useful for\nmonitoring response to therapy.\nRegarding clinical signs: in most cases, elephants have not shown\nclinical signs until the disease is well advanced. Elephants are\nsusceptible to both _M.tuberculosis_ and _M.bovis_.\nWhile most cases in the U.S. have been due to _M. tb_, we may find\nmore cases of _M. bovis_ in Asia, where elephants often share grazing\nland with domestic livestock.\nA brief history of elephant TB and a further description of\nserological tests can be found in the summary document of a 2005\nelephant TB research meeting (Summary - Elephant Tuberculosis\nResearch Workshop May 2005, available at\n<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).\n--\nSusan Mikota DVM\nDirector of Veterinary Programs and Research\nElephant Care International\n<http://www.elephantcare.org>\n<smikota@elephantcare.org>\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (03) 20070624.2039\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (02) 20070620.1990\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal 20070616.1962\n....................................arn/msp/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Frankel,\nM.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., Emeritus Professor of Medicine, University of\nHawaii: \"It would be useful to know what is meant by the statement\n\"the elephants have tested positive for TB...\" Are these elephants\nill, and was that the reason for testing? Were they tested by skin\ntest or by some other means? Do they have latent infection or\ntuberculosis disease?\"\nThe following firsthand response has been received from Dr Susan Mikota]:\n\nIn January 2006, a study was conducted by Dr. Kamal Giri in\nfulfillment of his MvSc. degree at the Institute of Agriculture and\nAnimal Science. Dr. Giri's work was assisted by Elephant Care\nInternational and Tufts Center for Conservation Medicine. TB has been\nobserved postmortem and anecdotally reported in Nepal, India, and\nother Asian countries. This was the 1st comprehensive evaluation of\nrange country elephants for TB.\nIn addition to collecting trunk wash samples (which were cultured at\nthe National Tuberculosis Lab in Nepal and the National Veterinary\nServices Lab in the U.S.), we collected blood for several serological\nTB assays: (ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK, multi-antigen print\nimmunoassay (MAPIA), and immunoblot, as well as for CBCs, serum\nchemistries, and an immune profile. The determination of which\nelephants were positive or considered to be at risk to develop active\nTB was made by evaluating all of the data with particular attention\ngiven to the ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA tests, which we\nhave found to be useful to diagnose TB among elephants in the U.S. A\nfull report was given to the government of Nepal.\nWe do not use skin testing in elephants because it is not accurate\n(see Lewerin, S.S. et al, 2005. Outbreak of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection among captive Asian elephants in a Swedish\nzoo. Vet Rec. 156(6):171-175 and also Mikota, S.K. et al, 2001.\nEpidemiology & Diagnosis of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in captive\nAsian elephants (_Elephas maximus_). Journal of Zoo and Wildlife\nMedicine 32(1):1-16).\nElephants that are culture positive clearly have active TB. We don't\nreally know whether elephants develop latent disease or whether we\nsimply fail to detect active disease because of the limitations of\nour diagnostic techniques. We cannot X-ray adult elephants.\nCulture has inherent limitations as a primary diagnostic technique.\nFailure to isolate the organism does not rule out infection.\nReporting time is slow (up to 8 weeks) because pathogenic\nmycobacteria may grow slowly. The trunk wash method of sample\ncollection results in variable sample quality. Overgrowth due to\ncontamination from trunk wash samples occurs and may compromise the\nreliability of culture results, especially if overgrowth is not\nreported.\nObtaining 3 samples may not be practical or affordable for screening\nlarge numbers of elephants in Asia, where surveillance is urgently\nneeded.\nSerological tests that have been under investigation in the U.S. have\nshown great promise for improving our ability to diagnose TB in\nelephants.\nThe Elephant TB STAT-PAK is a lateral-flow assay that incorporates a\nunique cocktail of mycobacterial antigens impregnated on a\nnitrocellulose membrane and placed in a plastic cassette similar to a\npregnancy test kit. Serum, plasma, or whole blood may be used and\nresults are available in 20 minutes (see Lyashchenko, K.P. et al,\n2006. Tuberculosis in elephants: antibody responses to defined\nantigens of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, potential for early\ndiagnosis, and monitoring of treatment. Clin Vaccine Immunol\n13(7):722-732, and Lyashchenko, K. et al, 2005. Application of MAPIA\n(Multiple antigen print immunoassay) and rapid lateral flow\ntechnology for tuberculosis testing of elephants. 2005 Proceedings\nAAZV, AAWV, AZA Nutrition Advisory Group, pp. 64-65).\nThe MAPIA is a laboratory procedure for antibody detection that uses\na panel of multiple purified and recombinant antigens of _M.\ntuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ that are separately applied to a\nnitrocellulose membrane using an automated printing device (see\nLyashchenko, K. et al., 2000. Multi-antigen print immunoassay for the\ndevelopment of serological diagnosis of infectious disease. Journal\nof Immunological Methods 242:91-100).\nExcluding the data from Nepal, approximately 99 Asian and 72 African\nelephants in Europe, Australia, South Africa, and the U.S. have been\ntested using the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA, including 22\nelephants with culture-confirmed TB. Preliminary data has\ndemonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity for\nthe Elephant TB STAT-PAK and 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent\nspecificity for the MAPIA using culture as the reference standard.\nThe TB STAT-PAK has recently completed government licensing\nprocedures in the U.S. and will likely be commercially available\nlater this year [2007].\nIf the Elephant TB STAT-PAK is used as a screening test and the MAPIA\nis sequentially applied as a confirmatory assay, the accuracy of this\ntesting algorithm is 100 percent. Seroconversion on Elephant TB\nSTAT-PAK and MAPIA has been noted in several elephants months to\nyears prior to a positive culture (Lyashchenko 2006). In one elephant\nthat was euthanized and determined to be TB positive, retrospective\nevaluation of serum indicated seroconversion 8 years [earlier].\nA study by Dr. Scott Larsen (U.C. Davis) and Dr. Mo Salman (U. of\nColorado) using a 6-antigen ELISA demonstrated an estimated\nsensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 100 percent, on a\nsample size of 47 Asian and African elephants (7 culture positive)\n(see Larsen, R.S., et al. 2000. Evaluation of a multiple-antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection in captive elephants. Journal of Zoo and\nWildlife Medicine 31(3): 291-302).\nThe ELISA continues to be evaluated but is not available commercially.\nAn important advantage of TB serodiagnosis compared to trunk wash\nculture is that, once established, the antibody response remains\nsustained throughout infection and disease, while culture may be\nintermittently positive or negative in infected elephants. A decline\nin specific antibodies to certain antigens in MAPIA has been observed\nin 7 culture positive elephants tested to date that had undergone\ntreatment, suggesting that this technology may also be a useful for\nmonitoring response to therapy.\nRegarding clinical signs: in most cases, elephants have not shown\nclinical signs until the disease is well advanced. Elephants are\nsusceptible to both _M.tuberculosis_ and _M.bovis_.\nWhile most cases in the U.S. have been due to _M. tb_, we may find\nmore cases of _M. bovis_ in Asia, where elephants often share grazing\nland with domestic livestock.\nA brief history of elephant TB and a further description of\nserological tests can be found in the summary document of a 2005\nelephant TB research meeting (Summary - Elephant Tuberculosis\nResearch Workshop May 2005, available at\n<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).\n--\nSusan Mikota DVM\nDirector of Veterinary Programs and Research\nElephant Care International\n<http://www.elephantcare.org>\n<smikota@elephantcare.org>\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (03) 20070624.2039\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (02) 20070620.1990\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal 20070616.1962\n....................................arn/msp/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Frankel,\nM.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.P., Emeritus Professor of Medicine, University of\nHawaii: \"It would be useful to know what is meant by the statement\n\"the elephants have tested positive for TB...\" Are these elephants\nill, and was that the reason for testing? Were they tested by skin\ntest or by some other means? Do they have latent infection or\ntuberculosis disease?\"\nThe following firsthand response has been received from Dr Susan Mikota]:\n\nIn January 2006, a study was conducted by Dr. Kamal Giri in\nfulfillment of his MvSc. degree at the Institute of Agriculture and\nAnimal Science. Dr. Giri's work was assisted by Elephant Care\nInternational and Tufts Center for Conservation Medicine. TB has been\nobserved postmortem and anecdotally reported in Nepal, India, and\nother Asian countries. This was the 1st comprehensive evaluation of\nrange country elephants for TB.\nIn addition to collecting trunk wash samples (which were cultured at\nthe National Tuberculosis Lab in Nepal and the National Veterinary\nServices Lab in the U.S.), we collected blood for several serological\nTB assays: (ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK, multi-antigen print\nimmunoassay (MAPIA), and immunoblot, as well as for CBCs, serum\nchemistries, and an immune profile. The determination of which\nelephants were positive or considered to be at risk to develop active\nTB was made by evaluating all of the data with particular attention\ngiven to the ELISA, Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA tests, which we\nhave found to be useful to diagnose TB among elephants in the U.S. A\nfull report was given to the government of Nepal.\nWe do not use skin testing in elephants because it is not accurate\n(see Lewerin, S.S. et al, 2005. Outbreak of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection among captive Asian elephants in a Swedish\nzoo. Vet Rec. 156(6):171-175 and also Mikota, S.K. et al, 2001.\nEpidemiology & Diagnosis of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in captive\nAsian elephants (_Elephas maximus_). Journal of Zoo and Wildlife\nMedicine 32(1):1-16).\nElephants that are culture positive clearly have active TB. We don't\nreally know whether elephants develop latent disease or whether we\nsimply fail to detect active disease because of the limitations of\nour diagnostic techniques. We cannot X-ray adult elephants.\nCulture has inherent limitations as a primary diagnostic technique.\nFailure to isolate the organism does not rule out infection.\nReporting time is slow (up to 8 weeks) because pathogenic\nmycobacteria may grow slowly. The trunk wash method of sample\ncollection results in variable sample quality. Overgrowth due to\ncontamination from trunk wash samples occurs and may compromise the\nreliability of culture results, especially if overgrowth is not\nreported.\nObtaining 3 samples may not be practical or affordable for screening\nlarge numbers of elephants in Asia, where surveillance is urgently\nneeded.\nSerological tests that have been under investigation in the U.S. have\nshown great promise for improving our ability to diagnose TB in\nelephants.\nThe Elephant TB STAT-PAK is a lateral-flow assay that incorporates a\nunique cocktail of mycobacterial antigens impregnated on a\nnitrocellulose membrane and placed in a plastic cassette similar to a\npregnancy test kit. Serum, plasma, or whole blood may be used and\nresults are available in 20 minutes (see Lyashchenko, K.P. et al,\n2006. Tuberculosis in elephants: antibody responses to defined\nantigens of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, potential for early\ndiagnosis, and monitoring of treatment.

Application of MAPIA\n(Multiple antigen print immunoassay) and rapid lateral flow\ntechnology for tuberculosis testing of elephants. 2005 Proceedings\nAAZV, AAWV, AZA Nutrition Advisory Group, pp. 64-65).\nThe MAPIA is a laboratory procedure for antibody detection that uses\na panel of multiple purified and recombinant antigens of _M.\ntuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ that are separately applied to a\nnitrocellulose membrane using an automated printing device (see\nLyashchenko, K. et al., 2000. Multi-antigen print immunoassay for the\ndevelopment of serological diagnosis of infectious disease. Journal\nof Immunological Methods 242:91-100).\nExcluding the data from Nepal, approximately 99 Asian and 72 African\nelephants in Europe, Australia, South Africa, and the U.S. have been\ntested using the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA, including 22\nelephants with culture-confirmed TB. Preliminary data has\ndemonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity for\nthe Elephant TB STAT-PAK and 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent\nspecificity for the MAPIA using culture as the reference standard.\nThe TB STAT-PAK has recently completed government licensing\nprocedures in the U.S. and will likely be commercially available\nlater this year [2007].\nIf the Elephant TB STAT-PAK is used as a screening test and the MAPIA\nis sequentially applied as a confirmatory assay, the accuracy of this\ntesting algorithm is 100 percent. Seroconversion on Elephant TB\nSTAT-PAK and MAPIA has been noted in several elephants months to\nyears prior to a positive culture (Lyashchenko 2006). In one elephant\nthat was euthanized and determined to be TB positive, retrospective\nevaluation of serum indicated seroconversion 8 years [earlier].\nA study by Dr. Scott Larsen (U.C. Davis) and Dr. Mo Salman (U. of\nColorado) using a 6-antigen ELISA demonstrated an estimated\nsensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 100 percent, on a\nsample size of 47 Asian and African elephants (7 culture positive)\n(see Larsen, R.S., et al. 2000.

Journal\nof Immunological Methods 242:91-100).\nExcluding the data from Nepal, approximately 99 Asian and 72 African\nelephants in Europe, Australia, South Africa, and the U.S. have been\ntested using the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA, including 22\nelephants with culture-confirmed TB. Preliminary data has\ndemonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity for\nthe Elephant TB STAT-PAK and 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent\nspecificity for the MAPIA using culture as the reference standard.\nThe TB STAT-PAK has recently completed government licensing\nprocedures in the U.S. and will likely be commercially available\nlater this year [2007].\nIf the Elephant TB STAT-PAK is used as a screening test and the MAPIA\nis sequentially applied as a confirmatory assay, the accuracy of this\ntesting algorithm is 100 percent. Seroconversion on Elephant TB\nSTAT-PAK and MAPIA has been noted in several elephants months to\nyears prior to a positive culture (Lyashchenko 2006). In one elephant\nthat was euthanized and determined to be TB positive, retrospective\nevaluation of serum indicated seroconversion 8 years [earlier].\nA study by Dr. Scott Larsen (U.C. Davis) and Dr. Mo Salman (U. of\nColorado) using a 6-antigen ELISA demonstrated an estimated\nsensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 100 percent, on a\nsample size of 47 Asian and African elephants (7 culture positive)\n(see Larsen, R.S., et al. 2000. Evaluation of a multiple-antigen\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of _Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis_ infection in captive elephants. Journal of Zoo and\nWildlife Medicine 31(3): 291-302).\nThe ELISA continues to be evaluated but is not available commercially.\nAn important advantage of TB serodiagnosis compared to trunk wash\nculture is that, once established, the antibody response remains\nsustained throughout infection and disease, while culture may be\nintermittently positive or negative in infected elephants. A decline\nin specific antibodies to certain antigens in MAPIA has been observed\nin 7 culture positive elephants tested to date that had undergone\ntreatment, suggesting that this technology may also be a useful for\nmonitoring response to therapy.\nRegarding clinical signs: in most cases, elephants have not shown\nclinical signs until the disease is well advanced. Elephants are\nsusceptible to both _M.tuberculosis_ and _M.bovis_.\nWhile most cases in the U.S. have been due to _M. tb_, we may find\nmore cases of _M. bovis_ in Asia, where elephants often share grazing\nland with domestic livestock.\nA brief history of elephant TB and a further description of\nserological tests can be found in the summary document of a 2005\nelephant TB research meeting (Summary - Elephant Tuberculosis\nResearch Workshop May 2005, available at\n<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).\n--\nSusan Mikota DVM\nDirector of Veterinary Programs and Research\nElephant Care International\n<http://www.elephantcare.org>\n<smikota@elephantcare.org>\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (03) 20070624.2039\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal (02) 20070620.1990\nTuberculosis, elephants - Nepal 20070616.1962\n....................................arn/msp/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

NTSS data were\nanalyzed for reported XDR TB cases during 1993-2006; a total of 49\ncases (3 percent of evaluable multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB cases) met\nthe revised case definition for XDR TB. Of these, 17 (35 percent)\nwere reported during 2000-2006. Compared with 1993-1999, cases from\n2000-2006 were more likely to be in persons who were foreign-born and\nless likely to be in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nXDR TB presents a global threat and a challenge to TB-control\nactivities in the USA. To prevent the spread of XDR TB, renewed\nvigilance is needed through drug-susceptibility testing, case\nreporting, specialized care, infection control, and expanded capacity\nfor outbreak detection and response.\nTB cases reported to NTSS from 50 states and the District of Columbia\n(DC) were analyzed for the period 1993-2006. All culture-confirmed\ncases with initial drug-susceptibility test (DST) results reported\nfor at least isoniazid and rifampin were included in the analysis.\nBecause susceptibility testing is time consuming, especially for 2nd\nline drugs, initial DST results are reported separately to avoid\ndelaying reporting of routine TB case data. At the end of treatment,\nthe outcome is reported in a 2nd follow-up report. The HIV status of\nTB cases reported to NTSS was available through 2006, except in\nCalifornia, where only data on positive HIV test results were\navailable through 2004.\nTB cases reported during 1993-1999, a period of rapidly decreasing\nincidence of both TB and MDR TB, were compared with cases reported\nduring 2000-2006, a period of slower decline in TB and MDR TB rates.\nDuring 1993-2006, a total of 202 436 culture-confirmed TB cases were\nreported to NTSS; 190 312 of these cases had initial DST results for\nat least isoniazid and rifampin, including 2927 (2 percent) with\ninitial resistance to both drugs (that is, MDR TB). Of the 2927 MDR\nTB cases, 1665 (57 percent) had DST results reported for at least a\nfluoroquinolone and an injectable 2nd line drug. Of these, 49 cases\n(3 percent) met the revised definition of XDR TB, including 32 cases\nreported during 1993-1999 and 17 cases during 2000-2006 [Table - for\ntable, see original URL - Mod.LL].\nThe 49 XDR TB cases were reported from 9 states and one city, with\nthe largest numbers in New York City (19 cases) and California (11\ncases) [Figure - for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. HIV status\nwas known for 29 (59 percent) of the 49 persons with XDR TB; 16 (55\npercent) were HIV positive. During 1993-1999, a total of 19 persons\nwith XDR TB had known HIV status, of whom 14 (74 percent) were HIV\npositive; during 2000-2006, 10 persons had known HIV status, of whom\n2 (20 percent) were HIV positive. The number and percentage of\npersons with XDR TB in the group aged 25-44 years decreased from 21\n(66 percent) during 1993-1999 to 6 (35 percent) during 2000-2006.\nWhen the 2 periods were compared, the number of XDR TB cases among\nforeign-born persons did not change substantially, but the percentage\nof XDR-TB cases among foreign-born persons increased from 39 percent\n(12 cases) in 1993-1999 to 76 percent (13 cases) in 2000-2006 as the\nnumber of XDR TB cases among USA-born cases decreased. Among\nracial/ethnic populations, 9 (28 percent) of 32 XDR TB cases during\n1993-1999 were reported among non-Hispanic blacks, decreasing to 2\n(12 percent) of 17 cases during 2000-2006. Conversely, the number and\npercentage of cases among Asians increased from 3 (9 percent) during\n1993-1999 to 7 (41 percent) during 2000-2006. Sputum microscopy for\nacid-fast bacilli was positive in 27 (69 percent) of the 39 cases\nwith known results. Mortality in XDR TB cases was strongly associated\nwith HIV infection. Among 41 persons with XDR TB and known outcomes,\n12 (29 percent) persons died; 10 of those had HIV infection, and the\nother 2 did not have HIV test results reported.\n[Byline: NS Shah NS, R Pratt, S Althomsons, et al]\nMMWR Editorial note\n--------------\nAfter approximately 30 years of declining trends, a TB epidemic\noccurred in the USA during 1985-1992. From 22 201 cases in 1985 (9.3\nper 100 000 population), reported TB increased to 26 673 cases in\n1992 (10.4 per 100 000 population) (7). Although the incidence of MDR\nTB in the USA was largely unknown before 1993, the number of cases\nbegan increasing in New York City in the early 1980s (8), and\nnumerous outbreaks of MDR TB were described in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s (9). With implementation of elements of the 1992 National\nAction Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, reported MDR\nTB cases declined rapidly (10). TB control activities included\nimproving laboratory services for rapid, accurate culture and DST,\nimproving infection control, and strengthening NTSS to include DST\nand HIV test results beginning in 1993. The rapid decrease in MDR TB\ncases during 1993-1999 likely correlated with the 34 percent decline\nin TB cases overall in the USA to 17 501 (6.3 per 100 000) in 1999 (7).\nEffective treatment of MDR TB requires administration, for 18-24\nmonths, of 4 to 6 drugs to which the infecting organism is\nsusceptible, including multiple 2nd line drugs. Beginning in the\n1980s, the use of these drugs increased substantially as physicians\nand TB control programs treated growing numbers of MDR TB cases.\nIncreased use of these drugs resulted in MDR TB strains with\nextensive resistance to both 1st and 2nd line drugs. Thus, XDR TB in\nthe 1990s likely represented the legacy of the 1985-1992 TB epidemic\nin the USA and treatments to combat the spike in MDR TB cases.\nCharacteristics of XDR TB cases changed during 2000-2006 in parallel\nwith the changing epidemiology of TB in general and MDR TB in\nparticular. These changes included an overall decrease in the number\nof cases, a decrease in the proportion of cases in HIV-infected\npersons, an increase in the proportion of cases among foreign-born\npersons, and an increase in the proportion of Asians among persons\nwith XDR TB, compared with 1993-1999 (7).\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations:\n- the number of XDR TB cases is a minimum estimate because of\nincomplete DST data. Although 57 percent of MDR-TB cases had DST\nresults reported for at least a fluoroquinolone and at least one of\nthe 3 2nd-line injectable drugs, only 22 percent had DST results\nreported for all drug combinations in the definition of XDR TB,\ntaking into consideration cross-resistance among drugs and data\navailable in NTSS. Initial TB isolates with any resistance to\nrifampin or resistance to any two 1st line drugs should be tested for\nsusceptibility to a full panel of anti-TB drugs, and the results\nshould be reported accordingly.\n- Aggregate reporting of drug resistance traditionally has been based\nonly on initial DST results, not on drug resistance that develops\nduring treatment. Because of the complexity of 2nd line DST, results\ncan be delayed by several months and might not be included in the\nreport of initial DST results.\n- Approximately 20 percent of reported TB cases do not have positive\ncultures that would enable DSTs to be performed.\n- NTSS data for 2006 are provisional, and final case counts,\nincluding XDR TB cases, are subject to revision.\n- Finally, HIV test results usually are reported to NTSS after both\nTB and HIV surveillance systems have verified their annual case\ncounts. Thus, HIV test results lag behind TB case counts, and data on\nHIV status are complete through 2005 but provisional for 2006, except\nfor California, which provided data only through 2004. In addition,\nHIV test results from California are less complete.\nThe NTSS surveillance data summarized in this report represent an\nupdated measurement of XDR TB in the USA. However, surveillance data\ndo not enable a detailed understanding of how most XDR TB cases\narise. For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR\nTB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual\npatients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.\nUse of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing\nthroughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB\ninternationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and\ndeterminants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.\nAttention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,\nsurveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,\ncontact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection\ncontrol) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner\nthat MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB\nTask Force is developing a domestic and international response for\nthe American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level\ninteragency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive\nresponse and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.\nAdditional information regarding XDR TB is available at\n<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/en/index.html>.\nReferences:\n1.

Worldwide, TB remains one of the leading causes of death from\ninfectious disease. An estimated 2 billion persons (that is, one\nthird of the world's population) are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.\nEach year, approximately 9 million persons become ill from TB; of\nthese, nearly 2 million die from the disease.\nWorld TB Day provides an opportunity for TB programs, nongovernmental\norganizations, and other partners to describe problems and solutions\nrelated to the TB pandemic and to support worldwide TB-control\nactivities. The theme for this year's observance is \"TB Elimination:\nNow is the Time!\"\nAfter approximately 30 years of decline, the number of TB cases\nreported in the USA increased 20 percent during 1985-1992. This led\nto a renewed emphasis on TB control and prevention during the 1990s.\nHowever, although the 2006 TB rate is the lowest recorded in the USA\nsince national reporting began in 1953, the average annual decline\nhas slowed since 2000. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB remains a\nthreat, extensively drug-resistant TB has become an emerging threat,\nand persons of racial/ethnic minority populations and foreign-born\npersons continue to account for a disproportionate number of TB cases.\nCDC and its partners are committed to eliminating TB in the USA. In\nmany states, education and awareness programs convened by local TB\ncoalitions will take place in commemoration of World TB Day.\nAdditional information about World TB Day and CDC TB-elimination\nactivities is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/worldtbday>.\"\nAs seen in South Africa, XDR TB in HIV infected patients can cause\ndeath before the initial cultures are positive, let alone drug\nsensitivity testing.

For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR\nTB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual\npatients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.\nUse of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing\nthroughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB\ninternationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and\ndeterminants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.\nAttention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,\nsurveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,\ncontact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection\ncontrol) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner\nthat MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB\nTask Force is developing a domestic and international response for\nthe American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level\ninteragency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive\nresponse and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.\nAdditional information regarding XDR TB is available at\n<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/en/index.html>.\nReferences:\n1.

The print copy of MMWR\ncontaining the posting above, provides this text related to the day\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5611a1.htm?s_cid=mm5611a1_e>\n\"World TB Day is observed on 24 March each year and commemorates the\ndate in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced the discovery of\n_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis\n(TB). Worldwide, TB remains one of the leading causes of death from\ninfectious disease. An estimated 2 billion persons (that is, one\nthird of the world's population) are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.\nEach year, approximately 9 million persons become ill from TB; of\nthese, nearly 2 million die from the disease.\nWorld TB Day provides an opportunity for TB programs, nongovernmental\norganizations, and other partners to describe problems and solutions\nrelated to the TB pandemic and to support worldwide TB-control\nactivities. The theme for this year's observance is \"TB Elimination:\nNow is the Time!\"\nAfter approximately 30 years of decline, the number of TB cases\nreported in the USA increased 20 percent during 1985-1992. This led\nto a renewed emphasis on TB control and prevention during the 1990s.\nHowever, although the 2006 TB rate is the lowest recorded in the USA\nsince national reporting began in 1953, the average annual decline\nhas slowed since 2000. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB remains a\nthreat, extensively drug-resistant TB has become an emerging threat,\nand persons of racial/ethnic minority populations and foreign-born\npersons continue to account for a disproportionate number of TB cases.\nCDC and its partners are committed to eliminating TB in the USA. In\nmany states, education and awareness programs convened by local TB\ncoalitions will take place in commemoration of World TB Day.\nAdditional information about World TB Day and CDC TB-elimination\nactivities is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/worldtbday>.\"\nAs seen in South Africa, XDR TB in HIV infected patients can cause\ndeath before the initial cultures are positive, let alone drug\nsensitivity testing. The global community has a long way to go to\neradicate TB, especially in the HIV era. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nTuberculosis, XDR - South Africa (06) 20070319.0959\nTuberculosis, XDR, 1991-2003 - Spain 20070302.0738\nTuberculosis, XDR - South Africa (05) 20070228.0717\nTuberculosis, XDR - South Africa (04) 20070220.0638\nTuberculosis, XDR - South Africa (03) 20070209.0504\nTuberculosis, XDR - worldwide 20070205.0456\nTuberculosis, XDR - South Africa (02) 20070128.0375\nTuberculosis, XDR - South Africa: interventions 20070126.0349\nTuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant - Canada (ON) (02) 20070125.0340\nTuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant - Canada (ON) 20070124.0318\n2006\n----\nTuberculosis, multiresistant - Hungary 20061110.3233\nTuberculosis, multiresistant - South Africa (KN) (04): nationwide 20061019.3003\nTuberculosis, multi-drug resistant - South Africa (KN) 20060904.2514\n..................ll/mj/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

A more detailed description of these\nfindings and preliminary data from the USA National TB Surveillance\nSystem (NTSS) were published in 2006 (3). The USA data indicated that\n74 TB cases reported during 1993-2004 met the case definition for XDR\nTB (3). Subsequent reports suggested different definitions for XDR TB\n(4,5). In October 2006, the WHO (World Health Organization) convened\nan Emergency Global Task Force on XDR TB, which revised the case\ndefinition to specify resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin\namong 1st line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and\nresistance to at least one 2nd line injectable drug (amikacin,\ncapreomycin, or kanamycin) (6).\nThis report updates the 2006 report on XDR TB in the USA, using the\nrevised case definition and provisional data for 2006. NTSS data were\nanalyzed for reported XDR TB cases during 1993-2006; a total of 49\ncases (3 percent of evaluable multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB cases) met\nthe revised case definition for XDR TB. Of these, 17 (35 percent)\nwere reported during 2000-2006. Compared with 1993-1999, cases from\n2000-2006 were more likely to be in persons who were foreign-born and\nless likely to be in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nXDR TB presents a global threat and a challenge to TB-control\nactivities in the USA. To prevent the spread of XDR TB, renewed\nvigilance is needed through drug-susceptibility testing, case\nreporting, specialized care, infection control, and expanded capacity\nfor outbreak detection and response.\nTB cases reported to NTSS from 50 states and the District of Columbia\n(DC) were analyzed for the period 1993-2006.

A more detailed description of these\nfindings and preliminary data from the USA National TB Surveillance\nSystem (NTSS) were published in 2006 (3). The USA data indicated that\n74 TB cases reported during 1993-2004 met the case definition for XDR\nTB (3). Subsequent reports suggested different definitions for XDR TB\n(4,5). In October 2006, the WHO (World Health Organization) convened\nan Emergency Global Task Force on XDR TB, which revised the case\ndefinition to specify resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin\namong 1st line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and\nresistance to at least one 2nd line injectable drug (amikacin,\ncapreomycin, or kanamycin) (6).\nThis report updates the 2006 report on XDR TB in the USA, using the\nrevised case definition and provisional data for 2006. NTSS data were\nanalyzed for reported XDR TB cases during 1993-2006; a total of 49\ncases (3 percent of evaluable multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB cases) met\nthe revised case definition for XDR TB. Of these, 17 (35 percent)\nwere reported during 2000-2006. Compared with 1993-1999, cases from\n2000-2006 were more likely to be in persons who were foreign-born and\nless likely to be in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nXDR TB presents a global threat and a challenge to TB-control\nactivities in the USA. To prevent the spread of XDR TB, renewed\nvigilance is needed through drug-susceptibility testing, case\nreporting, specialized care, infection control, and expanded capacity\nfor outbreak detection and response.\nTB cases reported to NTSS from 50 states and the District of Columbia\n(DC) were analyzed for the period 1993-2006. All culture-confirmed\ncases with initial drug-susceptibility test (DST) results reported\nfor at least isoniazid and rifampin were included in the analysis.\nBecause susceptibility testing is time consuming, especially for 2nd\nline drugs, initial DST results are reported separately to avoid\ndelaying reporting of routine TB case data. At the end of treatment,\nthe outcome is reported in a 2nd follow-up report. The HIV status of\nTB cases reported to NTSS was available through 2006, except in\nCalifornia, where only data on positive HIV test results were\navailable through 2004.\nTB cases reported during 1993-1999, a period of rapidly decreasing\nincidence of both TB and MDR TB, were compared with cases reported\nduring 2000-2006, a period of slower decline in TB and MDR TB rates.\nDuring 1993-2006, a total of 202 436 culture-confirmed TB cases were\nreported to NTSS; 190 312 of these cases had initial DST results for\nat least isoniazid and rifampin, including 2927 (2 percent) with\ninitial resistance to both drugs (that is, MDR TB). Of the 2927 MDR\nTB cases, 1665 (57 percent) had DST results reported for at least a\nfluoroquinolone and an injectable 2nd line drug. Of these, 49 cases\n(3 percent) met the revised definition of XDR TB, including 32 cases\nreported during 1993-1999 and 17 cases during 2000-2006 [Table - for\ntable, see original URL - Mod.LL].\nThe 49 XDR TB cases were reported from 9 states and one city, with\nthe largest numbers in New York City (19 cases) and California (11\ncases) [Figure - for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. HIV status\nwas known for 29 (59 percent) of the 49 persons with XDR TB; 16 (55\npercent) were HIV positive. During 1993-1999, a total of 19 persons\nwith XDR TB had known HIV status, of whom 14 (74 percent) were HIV\npositive; during 2000-2006, 10 persons had known HIV status, of whom\n2 (20 percent) were HIV positive. The number and percentage of\npersons with XDR TB in the group aged 25-44 years decreased from 21\n(66 percent) during 1993-1999 to 6 (35 percent) during 2000-2006.\nWhen the 2 periods were compared, the number of XDR TB cases among\nforeign-born persons did not change substantially, but the percentage\nof XDR-TB cases among foreign-born persons increased from 39 percent\n(12 cases) in 1993-1999 to 76 percent (13 cases) in 2000-2006 as the\nnumber of XDR TB cases among USA-born cases decreased. Among\nracial/ethnic populations, 9 (28 percent) of 32 XDR TB cases during\n1993-1999 were reported among non-Hispanic blacks, decreasing to 2\n(12 percent) of 17 cases during 2000-2006. Conversely, the number and\npercentage of cases among Asians increased from 3 (9 percent) during\n1993-1999 to 7 (41 percent) during 2000-2006. Sputum microscopy for\nacid-fast bacilli was positive in 27 (69 percent) of the 39 cases\nwith known results. Mortality in XDR TB cases was strongly associated\nwith HIV infection. Among 41 persons with XDR TB and known outcomes,\n12 (29 percent) persons died; 10 of those had HIV infection, and the\nother 2 did not have HIV test results reported.\n[Byline: NS Shah NS, R Pratt, S Althomsons, et al]\nMMWR Editorial note\n--------------\nAfter approximately 30 years of declining trends, a TB epidemic\noccurred in the USA during 1985-1992. From 22 201 cases in 1985 (9.3\nper 100 000 population), reported TB increased to 26 673 cases in\n1992 (10.4 per 100 000 population) (7). Although the incidence of MDR\nTB in the USA was largely unknown before 1993, the number of cases\nbegan increasing in New York City in the early 1980s (8), and\nnumerous outbreaks of MDR TB were described in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s (9). With implementation of elements of the 1992 National\nAction Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, reported MDR\nTB cases declined rapidly (10). TB control activities included\nimproving laboratory services for rapid, accurate culture and DST,\nimproving infection control, and strengthening NTSS to include DST\nand HIV test results beginning in 1993. The rapid decrease in MDR TB\ncases during 1993-1999 likely correlated with the 34 percent decline\nin TB cases overall in the USA to 17 501 (6.3 per 100 000) in 1999 (7).\nEffective treatment of MDR TB requires administration, for 18-24\nmonths, of 4 to 6 drugs to which the infecting organism is\nsusceptible, including multiple 2nd line drugs. Beginning in the\n1980s, the use of these drugs increased substantially as physicians\nand TB control programs treated growing numbers of MDR TB cases.\nIncreased use of these drugs resulted in MDR TB strains with\nextensive resistance to both 1st and 2nd line drugs. Thus, XDR TB in\nthe 1990s likely represented the legacy of the 1985-1992 TB epidemic\nin the USA and treatments to combat the spike in MDR TB cases.\nCharacteristics of XDR TB cases changed during 2000-2006 in parallel\nwith the changing epidemiology of TB in general and MDR TB in\nparticular. These changes included an overall decrease in the number\nof cases, a decrease in the proportion of cases in HIV-infected\npersons, an increase in the proportion of cases among foreign-born\npersons, and an increase in the proportion of Asians among persons\nwith XDR TB, compared with 1993-1999 (7).\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations:\n- the number of XDR TB cases is a minimum estimate because of\nincomplete DST data. Although 57 percent of MDR-TB cases had DST\nresults reported for at least a fluoroquinolone and at least one of\nthe 3 2nd-line injectable drugs, only 22 percent had DST results\nreported for all drug combinations in the definition of XDR TB,\ntaking into consideration cross-resistance among drugs and data\navailable in NTSS. Initial TB isolates with any resistance to\nrifampin or resistance to any two 1st line drugs should be tested for\nsusceptibility to a full panel of anti-TB drugs, and the results\nshould be reported accordingly.\n- Aggregate reporting of drug resistance traditionally has been based\nonly on initial DST results, not on drug resistance that develops\nduring treatment. Because of the complexity of 2nd line DST, results\ncan be delayed by several months and might not be included in the\nreport of initial DST results.\n- Approximately 20 percent of reported TB cases do not have positive\ncultures that would enable DSTs to be performed.\n- NTSS data for 2006 are provisional, and final case counts,\nincluding XDR TB cases, are subject to revision.\n- Finally, HIV test results usually are reported to NTSS after both\nTB and HIV surveillance systems have verified their annual case\ncounts. Thus, HIV test results lag behind TB case counts, and data on\nHIV status are complete through 2005 but provisional for 2006, except\nfor California, which provided data only through 2004. In addition,\nHIV test results from California are less complete.\nThe NTSS surveillance data summarized in this report represent an\nupdated measurement of XDR TB in the USA. However, surveillance data\ndo not enable a detailed understanding of how most XDR TB cases\narise. For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR\nTB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual\npatients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.\nUse of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing\nthroughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB\ninternationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and\ndeterminants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.\nAttention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,\nsurveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,\ncontact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection\ncontrol) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner\nthat MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB\nTask Force is developing a domestic and international response for\nthe American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level\ninteragency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive\nresponse and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.\nAdditional information regarding XDR TB is available at\n<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/en/index.html>.\nReferences:\n1.

A more detailed description of these\nfindings and preliminary data from the USA National TB Surveillance\nSystem (NTSS) were published in 2006 (3). The USA data indicated that\n74 TB cases reported during 1993-2004 met the case definition for XDR\nTB (3). Subsequent reports suggested different definitions for XDR TB\n(4,5). In October 2006, the WHO (World Health Organization) convened\nan Emergency Global Task Force on XDR TB, which revised the case\ndefinition to specify resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin\namong 1st line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and\nresistance to at least one 2nd line injectable drug (amikacin,\ncapreomycin, or kanamycin) (6).\nThis report updates the 2006 report on XDR TB in the USA, using the\nrevised case definition and provisional data for 2006. NTSS data were\nanalyzed for reported XDR TB cases during 1993-2006; a total of 49\ncases (3 percent of evaluable multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB cases) met\nthe revised case definition for XDR TB. Of these, 17 (35 percent)\nwere reported during 2000-2006. Compared with 1993-1999, cases from\n2000-2006 were more likely to be in persons who were foreign-born and\nless likely to be in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nXDR TB presents a global threat and a challenge to TB-control\nactivities in the USA. To prevent the spread of XDR TB, renewed\nvigilance is needed through drug-susceptibility testing, case\nreporting, specialized care, infection control, and expanded capacity\nfor outbreak detection and response.\nTB cases reported to NTSS from 50 states and the District of Columbia\n(DC) were analyzed for the period 1993-2006. All culture-confirmed\ncases with initial drug-susceptibility test (DST) results reported\nfor at least isoniazid and rifampin were included in the analysis.\nBecause susceptibility testing is time consuming, especially for 2nd\nline drugs, initial DST results are reported separately to avoid\ndelaying reporting of routine TB case data. At the end of treatment,\nthe outcome is reported in a 2nd follow-up report. The HIV status of\nTB cases reported to NTSS was available through 2006, except in\nCalifornia, where only data on positive HIV test results were\navailable through 2004.\nTB cases reported during 1993-1999, a period of rapidly decreasing\nincidence of both TB and MDR TB, were compared with cases reported\nduring 2000-2006, a period of slower decline in TB and MDR TB rates.\nDuring 1993-2006, a total of 202 436 culture-confirmed TB cases were\nreported to NTSS; 190 312 of these cases had initial DST results for\nat least isoniazid and rifampin, including 2927 (2 percent) with\ninitial resistance to both drugs (that is, MDR TB). Of the 2927 MDR\nTB cases, 1665 (57 percent) had DST results reported for at least a\nfluoroquinolone and an injectable 2nd line drug. Of these, 49 cases\n(3 percent) met the revised definition of XDR TB, including 32 cases\nreported during 1993-1999 and 17 cases during 2000-2006 [Table - for\ntable, see original URL - Mod.LL].\nThe 49 XDR TB cases were reported from 9 states and one city, with\nthe largest numbers in New York City (19 cases) and California (11\ncases) [Figure - for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. HIV status\nwas known for 29 (59 percent) of the 49 persons with XDR TB; 16 (55\npercent) were HIV positive. During 1993-1999, a total of 19 persons\nwith XDR TB had known HIV status, of whom 14 (74 percent) were HIV\npositive; during 2000-2006, 10 persons had known HIV status, of whom\n2 (20 percent) were HIV positive. The number and percentage of\npersons with XDR TB in the group aged 25-44 years decreased from 21\n(66 percent) during 1993-1999 to 6 (35 percent) during 2000-2006.\nWhen the 2 periods were compared, the number of XDR TB cases among\nforeign-born persons did not change substantially, but the percentage\nof XDR-TB cases among foreign-born persons increased from 39 percent\n(12 cases) in 1993-1999 to 76 percent (13 cases) in 2000-2006 as the\nnumber of XDR TB cases among USA-born cases decreased. Among\nracial/ethnic populations, 9 (28 percent) of 32 XDR TB cases during\n1993-1999 were reported among non-Hispanic blacks, decreasing to 2\n(12 percent) of 17 cases during 2000-2006. Conversely, the number and\npercentage of cases among Asians increased from 3 (9 percent) during\n1993-1999 to 7 (41 percent) during 2000-2006. Sputum microscopy for\nacid-fast bacilli was positive in 27 (69 percent) of the 39 cases\nwith known results. Mortality in XDR TB cases was strongly associated\nwith HIV infection. Among 41 persons with XDR TB and known outcomes,\n12 (29 percent) persons died; 10 of those had HIV infection, and the\nother 2 did not have HIV test results reported.\n[Byline: NS Shah NS, R Pratt, S Althomsons, et al]\nMMWR Editorial note\n--------------\nAfter approximately 30 years of declining trends, a TB epidemic\noccurred in the USA during 1985-1992. From 22 201 cases in 1985 (9.3\nper 100 000 population), reported TB increased to 26 673 cases in\n1992 (10.4 per 100 000 population) (7). Although the incidence of MDR\nTB in the USA was largely unknown before 1993, the number of cases\nbegan increasing in New York City in the early 1980s (8), and\nnumerous outbreaks of MDR TB were described in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s (9). With implementation of elements of the 1992 National\nAction Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, reported MDR\nTB cases declined rapidly (10). TB control activities included\nimproving laboratory services for rapid, accurate culture and DST,\nimproving infection control, and strengthening NTSS to include DST\nand HIV test results beginning in 1993. The rapid decrease in MDR TB\ncases during 1993-1999 likely correlated with the 34 percent decline\nin TB cases overall in the USA to 17 501 (6.3 per 100 000) in 1999 (7).\nEffective treatment of MDR TB requires administration, for 18-24\nmonths, of 4 to 6 drugs to which the infecting organism is\nsusceptible, including multiple 2nd line drugs. Beginning in the\n1980s, the use of these drugs increased substantially as physicians\nand TB control programs treated growing numbers of MDR TB cases.\nIncreased use of these drugs resulted in MDR TB strains with\nextensive resistance to both 1st and 2nd line drugs. Thus, XDR TB in\nthe 1990s likely represented the legacy of the 1985-1992 TB epidemic\nin the USA and treatments to combat the spike in MDR TB cases.\nCharacteristics of XDR TB cases changed during 2000-2006 in parallel\nwith the changing epidemiology of TB in general and MDR TB in\nparticular. These changes included an overall decrease in the number\nof cases, a decrease in the proportion of cases in HIV-infected\npersons, an increase in the proportion of cases among foreign-born\npersons, and an increase in the proportion of Asians among persons\nwith XDR TB, compared with 1993-1999 (7).\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations:\n- the number of XDR TB cases is a minimum estimate because of\nincomplete DST data. Although 57 percent of MDR-TB cases had DST\nresults reported for at least a fluoroquinolone and at least one of\nthe 3 2nd-line injectable drugs, only 22 percent had DST results\nreported for all drug combinations in the definition of XDR TB,\ntaking into consideration cross-resistance among drugs and data\navailable in NTSS. Initial TB isolates with any resistance to\nrifampin or resistance to any two 1st line drugs should be tested for\nsusceptibility to a full panel of anti-TB drugs, and the results\nshould be reported accordingly.\n- Aggregate reporting of drug resistance traditionally has been based\nonly on initial DST results, not on drug resistance that develops\nduring treatment. Because of the complexity of 2nd line DST, results\ncan be delayed by several months and might not be included in the\nreport of initial DST results.\n- Approximately 20 percent of reported TB cases do not have positive\ncultures that would enable DSTs to be performed.\n- NTSS data for 2006 are provisional, and final case counts,\nincluding XDR TB cases, are subject to revision.\n- Finally, HIV test results usually are reported to NTSS after both\nTB and HIV surveillance systems have verified their annual case\ncounts. Thus, HIV test results lag behind TB case counts, and data on\nHIV status are complete through 2005 but provisional for 2006, except\nfor California, which provided data only through 2004. In addition,\nHIV test results from California are less complete.\nThe NTSS surveillance data summarized in this report represent an\nupdated measurement of XDR TB in the USA. However, surveillance data\ndo not enable a detailed understanding of how most XDR TB cases\narise. For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR\nTB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual\npatients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.\nUse of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing\nthroughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB\ninternationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and\ndeterminants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.\nAttention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,\nsurveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,\ncontact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection\ncontrol) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner\nthat MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB\nTask Force is developing a domestic and international response for\nthe American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level\ninteragency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive\nresponse and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.\nAdditional information regarding XDR TB is available at\n<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/en/index.html>.\nReferences:\n1.

Worldwide, TB remains one of the leading causes of death from\ninfectious disease. An estimated 2 billion persons (that is, one\nthird of the world's population) are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.\nEach year, approximately 9 million persons become ill from TB; of\nthese, nearly 2 million die from the disease.\nWorld TB Day provides an opportunity for TB programs, nongovernmental\norganizations, and other partners to describe problems and solutions\nrelated to the TB pandemic and to support worldwide TB-control\nactivities. The theme for this year's observance is \"TB Elimination:\nNow is the Time!\"\nAfter approximately 30 years of decline, the number of TB cases\nreported in the USA increased 20 percent during 1985-1992. This led\nto a renewed emphasis on TB control and prevention during the 1990s.\nHowever, although the 2006 TB rate is the lowest recorded in the USA\nsince national reporting began in 1953, the average annual decline\nhas slowed since 2000. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB remains a\nthreat, extensively drug-resistant TB has become an emerging threat,\nand persons of racial/ethnic minority populations and foreign-born\npersons continue to account for a disproportionate number of TB cases.\nCDC and its partners are committed to eliminating TB in the USA. In\nmany states, education and awareness programs convened by local TB\ncoalitions will take place in commemoration of World TB Day.\nAdditional information about World TB Day and CDC TB-elimination\nactivities is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/worldtbday>.\"\nAs seen in South Africa, XDR TB in HIV infected patients can cause\ndeath before the initial cultures are positive, let alone drug\nsensitivity testing.

From 22 201 cases in 1985 (9.3\nper 100 000 population), reported TB increased to 26 673 cases in\n1992 (10.4 per 100 000 population) (7). Although the incidence of MDR\nTB in the USA was largely unknown before 1993, the number of cases\nbegan increasing in New York City in the early 1980s (8), and\nnumerous outbreaks of MDR TB were described in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s (9). With implementation of elements of the 1992 National\nAction Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, reported MDR\nTB cases declined rapidly (10). TB control activities included\nimproving laboratory services for rapid, accurate culture and DST,\nimproving infection control, and strengthening NTSS to include DST\nand HIV test results beginning in 1993. The rapid decrease in MDR TB\ncases during 1993-1999 likely correlated with the 34 percent decline\nin TB cases overall in the USA to 17 501 (6.3 per 100 000) in 1999 (7).\nEffective treatment of MDR TB requires administration, for 18-24\nmonths, of 4 to 6 drugs to which the infecting organism is\nsusceptible, including multiple 2nd line drugs. Beginning in the\n1980s, the use of these drugs increased substantially as physicians\nand TB control programs treated growing numbers of MDR TB cases.\nIncreased use of these drugs resulted in MDR TB strains with\nextensive resistance to both 1st and 2nd line drugs. Thus, XDR TB in\nthe 1990s likely represented the legacy of the 1985-1992 TB epidemic\nin the USA and treatments to combat the spike in MDR TB cases.\nCharacteristics of XDR TB cases changed during 2000-2006 in parallel\nwith the changing epidemiology of TB in general and MDR TB in\nparticular. These changes included an overall decrease in the number\nof cases, a decrease in the proportion of cases in HIV-infected\npersons, an increase in the proportion of cases among foreign-born\npersons, and an increase in the proportion of Asians among persons\nwith XDR TB, compared with 1993-1999 (7).\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations:\n- the number of XDR TB cases is a minimum estimate because of\nincomplete DST data. Although 57 percent of MDR-TB cases had DST\nresults reported for at least a fluoroquinolone and at least one of\nthe 3 2nd-line injectable drugs, only 22 percent had DST results\nreported for all drug combinations in the definition of XDR TB,\ntaking into consideration cross-resistance among drugs and data\navailable in NTSS. Initial TB isolates with any resistance to\nrifampin or resistance to any two 1st line drugs should be tested for\nsusceptibility to a full panel of anti-TB drugs, and the results\nshould be reported accordingly.\n- Aggregate reporting of drug resistance traditionally has been based\nonly on initial DST results, not on drug resistance that develops\nduring treatment. Because of the complexity of 2nd line DST, results\ncan be delayed by several months and might not be included in the\nreport of initial DST results.\n- Approximately 20 percent of reported TB cases do not have positive\ncultures that would enable DSTs to be performed.\n- NTSS data for 2006 are provisional, and final case counts,\nincluding XDR TB cases, are subject to revision.\n- Finally, HIV test results usually are reported to NTSS after both\nTB and HIV surveillance systems have verified their annual case\ncounts. Thus, HIV test results lag behind TB case counts, and data on\nHIV status are complete through 2005 but provisional for 2006, except\nfor California, which provided data only through 2004. In addition,\nHIV test results from California are less complete.\nThe NTSS surveillance data summarized in this report represent an\nupdated measurement of XDR TB in the USA. However, surveillance data\ndo not enable a detailed understanding of how most XDR TB cases\narise. For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR\nTB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual\npatients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.\nUse of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing\nthroughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB\ninternationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and\ndeterminants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.\nAttention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,\nsurveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,\ncontact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection\ncontrol) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner\nthat MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB\nTask Force is developing a domestic and international response for\nthe American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level\ninteragency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive\nresponse and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.\nAdditional information regarding XDR TB is available at\n<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/en/index.html>.\nReferences:\n1.

The print copy of MMWR\ncontaining the posting above, provides this text related to the day\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5611a1.htm?s_cid=mm5611a1_e>\n\"World TB Day is observed on 24 March each year and commemorates the\ndate in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced the discovery of\n_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis\n(TB). Worldwide, TB remains one of the leading causes of death from\ninfectious disease. An estimated 2 billion persons (that is, one\nthird of the world's population) are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.\nEach year, approximately 9 million persons become ill from TB; of\nthese, nearly 2 million die from the disease.\nWorld TB Day provides an opportunity for TB programs, nongovernmental\norganizations, and other partners to describe problems and solutions\nrelated to the TB pandemic and to support worldwide TB-control\nactivities. The theme for this year's observance is \"TB Elimination:\nNow is the Time!\"\nAfter approximately 30 years of decline, the number of TB cases\nreported in the USA increased 20 percent during 1985-1992. This led\nto a renewed emphasis on TB control and prevention during the 1990s.\nHowever, although the 2006 TB rate is the lowest recorded in the USA\nsince national reporting began in 1953, the average annual decline\nhas slowed since 2000. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB remains a\nthreat, extensively drug-resistant TB has become an emerging threat,\nand persons of racial/ethnic minority populations and foreign-born\npersons continue to account for a disproportionate number of TB cases.\nCDC and its partners are committed to eliminating TB in the USA. In\nmany states, education and awareness programs convened by local TB\ncoalitions will take place in commemoration of World TB Day.\nAdditional information about World TB Day and CDC TB-elimination\nactivities is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/worldtbday>.\"\nAs seen in South Africa, XDR TB in HIV infected patients can cause\ndeath before the initial cultures are positive, let alone drug\nsensitivity testing.

A more detailed description of these\nfindings and preliminary data from the USA National TB Surveillance\nSystem (NTSS) were published in 2006 (3). The USA data indicated that\n74 TB cases reported during 1993-2004 met the case definition for XDR\nTB (3). Subsequent reports suggested different definitions for XDR TB\n(4,5). In October 2006, the WHO (World Health Organization) convened\nan Emergency Global Task Force on XDR TB, which revised the case\ndefinition to specify resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin\namong 1st line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and\nresistance to at least one 2nd line injectable drug (amikacin,\ncapreomycin, or kanamycin) (6).\nThis report updates the 2006 report on XDR TB in the USA, using the\nrevised case definition and provisional data for 2006.

A more detailed description of these\nfindings and preliminary data from the USA National TB Surveillance\nSystem (NTSS) were published in 2006 (3). The USA data indicated that\n74 TB cases reported during 1993-2004 met the case definition for XDR\nTB (3). Subsequent reports suggested different definitions for XDR TB\n(4,5). In October 2006, the WHO (World Health Organization) convened\nan Emergency Global Task Force on XDR TB, which revised the case\ndefinition to specify resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin\namong 1st line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and\nresistance to at least one 2nd line injectable drug (amikacin,\ncapreomycin, or kanamycin) (6).\nThis report updates the 2006 report on XDR TB in the USA, using the\nrevised case definition and provisional data for 2006. NTSS data were\nanalyzed for reported XDR TB cases during 1993-2006; a total of 49\ncases (3 percent of evaluable multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB cases) met\nthe revised case definition for XDR TB. Of these, 17 (35 percent)\nwere reported during 2000-2006. Compared with 1993-1999, cases from\n2000-2006 were more likely to be in persons who were foreign-born and\nless likely to be in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\nXDR TB presents a global threat and a challenge to TB-control\nactivities in the USA. To prevent the spread of XDR TB, renewed\nvigilance is needed through drug-susceptibility testing, case\nreporting, specialized care, infection control, and expanded capacity\nfor outbreak detection and response.\nTB cases reported to NTSS from 50 states and the District of Columbia\n(DC) were analyzed for the period 1993-2006. All culture-confirmed\ncases with initial drug-susceptibility test (DST) results reported\nfor at least isoniazid and rifampin were included in the analysis.\nBecause susceptibility testing is time consuming, especially for 2nd\nline drugs, initial DST results are reported separately to avoid\ndelaying reporting of routine TB case data. At the end of treatment,\nthe outcome is reported in a 2nd follow-up report. The HIV status of\nTB cases reported to NTSS was available through 2006, except in\nCalifornia, where only data on positive HIV test results were\navailable through 2004.\nTB cases reported during 1993-1999, a period of rapidly decreasing\nincidence of both TB and MDR TB, were compared with cases reported\nduring 2000-2006, a period of slower decline in TB and MDR TB rates.\nDuring 1993-2006, a total of 202 436 culture-confirmed TB cases were\nreported to NTSS; 190 312 of these cases had initial DST results for\nat least isoniazid and rifampin, including 2927 (2 percent) with\ninitial resistance to both drugs (that is, MDR TB). Of the 2927 MDR\nTB cases, 1665 (57 percent) had DST results reported for at least a\nfluoroquinolone and an injectable 2nd line drug. Of these, 49 cases\n(3 percent) met the revised definition of XDR TB, including 32 cases\nreported during 1993-1999 and 17 cases during 2000-2006 [Table - for\ntable, see original URL - Mod.LL].\nThe 49 XDR TB cases were reported from 9 states and one city, with\nthe largest numbers in New York City (19 cases) and California (11\ncases) [Figure - for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. HIV status\nwas known for 29 (59 percent) of the 49 persons with XDR TB; 16 (55\npercent) were HIV positive. During 1993-1999, a total of 19 persons\nwith XDR TB had known HIV status, of whom 14 (74 percent) were HIV\npositive; during 2000-2006, 10 persons had known HIV status, of whom\n2 (20 percent) were HIV positive. The number and percentage of\npersons with XDR TB in the group aged 25-44 years decreased from 21\n(66 percent) during 1993-1999 to 6 (35 percent) during 2000-2006.\nWhen the 2 periods were compared, the number of XDR TB cases among\nforeign-born persons did not change substantially, but the percentage\nof XDR-TB cases among foreign-born persons increased from 39 percent\n(12 cases) in 1993-1999 to 76 percent (13 cases) in 2000-2006 as the\nnumber of XDR TB cases among USA-born cases decreased. Among\nracial/ethnic populations, 9 (28 percent) of 32 XDR TB cases during\n1993-1999 were reported among non-Hispanic blacks, decreasing to 2\n(12 percent) of 17 cases during 2000-2006. Conversely, the number and\npercentage of cases among Asians increased from 3 (9 percent) during\n1993-1999 to 7 (41 percent) during 2000-2006. Sputum microscopy for\nacid-fast bacilli was positive in 27 (69 percent) of the 39 cases\nwith known results. Mortality in XDR TB cases was strongly associated\nwith HIV infection. Among 41 persons with XDR TB and known outcomes,\n12 (29 percent) persons died; 10 of those had HIV infection, and the\nother 2 did not have HIV test results reported.\n[Byline: NS Shah NS, R Pratt, S Althomsons, et al]\nMMWR Editorial note\n--------------\nAfter approximately 30 years of declining trends, a TB epidemic\noccurred in the USA during 1985-1992. From 22 201 cases in 1985 (9.3\nper 100 000 population), reported TB increased to 26 673 cases in\n1992 (10.4 per 100 000 population) (7). Although the incidence of MDR\nTB in the USA was largely unknown before 1993, the number of cases\nbegan increasing in New York City in the early 1980s (8), and\nnumerous outbreaks of MDR TB were described in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s (9). With implementation of elements of the 1992 National\nAction Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, reported MDR\nTB cases declined rapidly (10). TB control activities included\nimproving laboratory services for rapid, accurate culture and DST,\nimproving infection control, and strengthening NTSS to include DST\nand HIV test results beginning in 1993. The rapid decrease in MDR TB\ncases during 1993-1999 likely correlated with the 34 percent decline\nin TB cases overall in the USA to 17 501 (6.3 per 100 000) in 1999 (7).\nEffective treatment of MDR TB requires administration, for 18-24\nmonths, of 4 to 6 drugs to which the infecting organism is\nsusceptible, including multiple 2nd line drugs. Beginning in the\n1980s, the use of these drugs increased substantially as physicians\nand TB control programs treated growing numbers of MDR TB cases.\nIncreased use of these drugs resulted in MDR TB strains with\nextensive resistance to both 1st and 2nd line drugs. Thus, XDR TB in\nthe 1990s likely represented the legacy of the 1985-1992 TB epidemic\nin the USA and treatments to combat the spike in MDR TB cases.\nCharacteristics of XDR TB cases changed during 2000-2006 in parallel\nwith the changing epidemiology of TB in general and MDR TB in\nparticular. These changes included an overall decrease in the number\nof cases, a decrease in the proportion of cases in HIV-infected\npersons, an increase in the proportion of cases among foreign-born\npersons, and an increase in the proportion of Asians among persons\nwith XDR TB, compared with 1993-1999 (7).\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations:\n- the number of XDR TB cases is a minimum estimate because of\nincomplete DST data. Although 57 percent of MDR-TB cases had DST\nresults reported for at least a fluoroquinolone and at least one of\nthe 3 2nd-line injectable drugs, only 22 percent had DST results\nreported for all drug combinations in the definition of XDR TB,\ntaking into consideration cross-resistance among drugs and data\navailable in NTSS. Initial TB isolates with any resistance to\nrifampin or resistance to any two 1st line drugs should be tested for\nsusceptibility to a full panel of anti-TB drugs, and the results\nshould be reported accordingly.\n- Aggregate reporting of drug resistance traditionally has been based\nonly on initial DST results, not on drug resistance that develops\nduring treatment. Because of the complexity of 2nd line DST, results\ncan be delayed by several months and might not be included in the\nreport of initial DST results.\n- Approximately 20 percent of reported TB cases do not have positive\ncultures that would enable DSTs to be performed.\n- NTSS data for 2006 are provisional, and final case counts,\nincluding XDR TB cases, are subject to revision.\n- Finally, HIV test results usually are reported to NTSS after both\nTB and HIV surveillance systems have verified their annual case\ncounts. Thus, HIV test results lag behind TB case counts, and data on\nHIV status are complete through 2005 but provisional for 2006, except\nfor California, which provided data only through 2004. In addition,\nHIV test results from California are less complete.\nThe NTSS surveillance data summarized in this report represent an\nupdated measurement of XDR TB in the USA. However, surveillance data\ndo not enable a detailed understanding of how most XDR TB cases\narise. For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR\nTB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual\npatients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.\nUse of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing\nthroughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB\ninternationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and\ndeterminants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.\nAttention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,\nsurveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,\ncontact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection\ncontrol) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner\nthat MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB\nTask Force is developing a domestic and international response for\nthe American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level\ninteragency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive\nresponse and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.\nAdditional information regarding XDR TB is available at\n<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/en/index.html>.\nReferences:\n1.

There\nwere 31 reactors based on compartive cervical reactions. The North Dakota\nAgriculture Department (ND Ag Dept) is waiting on confirmation by culture\nand PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). These cattle also had positive\nhistopatological lesions. There are some families that reportedly drank\nraw milk and are being tested. The ND Ag Dept has established a 5mile radius\naround the dairy where they will test cattle at dairies and trace animals\nthat may have been sold or relocated.\n--\nDA Meier\n<meierda@hotmail.com>\n[_Mycobacterium bovis_ can cause progressive disease in most warm-blooded\nvertebrates, including man. TB can spread to man via ingestion, inhalation\nand occupational exposure. It can be spread through milk. Furthermore, with\na number of reactors in a dairy it seems possible that other animals may\nhave had the disease and been sold or traded, consequently putting other\ndairies at risk of the disease. In turn, this may put other people at risk\nfrom occupational exposure and consumption of unpasteurized milk - Mod.TG]\n...................................tg/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Scientists from the Kruger Park noted that although many buffalo die\nof the disease it was not yet killing off massive numbers of these animals.\nBut other species, especially lion, appear to be suffering more heavily in\nthe short term. A number of recent cases have been established of lions\ndying from TB in both Kruger and Hluhluwe whereas it is possible buffalo can\ncarry the disease with them for life.\nIt is possible that lions are being badly affected as in Kruger many\nof the [big cats have FIV [feline immunodeficiency virus while\nthose in Hluhluwe have compromised immune systems because of heavy\ninbreeding.\nDewalt Keet, senior veterinarian in the Kruger Park's Directorate of Animal\nHealth at Skukuza, says the park management will spend the next 12 months\nconducting intensive research to establish more precisely what impact the\ndisease is having on the mortality of various species in the park. Kruger\nauthorities will then consider shooting out the most heavily infected herds.\nThe Mpumalanga Parks Board is preparing to either eliminate the entire\nherd of 350 to 400 buffalo in its Mthethomusha Game Reserve that abuts on\nthe south-western border of Kruger or to shoot the most heavily infected herds.\nBoth the Kruger and Mpumalanga park authorities have set up sterilised bomas\n[corrals where they will place pregnant buffalo cows in quarantine-like\nconditions so that they can breed a reservoir of TB-free buffalo to\nrepopulate areas where heavy culling might have to occur. The consequences\nof the epidemic are potentially critical for conservation and the protection\nof biodiversity in South Africa. Other game reserves are indicating a\nreluctance to purchase wild-caught game from Kruger and Hluhluwe, fearing\nthey may be contaminated. This is likely to cause revenue problems for\nreserves that rely on sale of wild game to bolster their conservation work.\nPlans to create large transfrontier conservation areas, popularly known as\npeace parks, between South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are in jeopardy\nas neighbouring states are reluctant to drop their game fences and run the\nrisk of their animals becoming infected. \"Practically, tuberculosis may move\nacross the borders of infected premises in either direction, and infected\nanimals on either side may thus remain a persistent source of infection that\nwill serve to maintain the infection and serve as sources of re-infection,\"\nsays Kriek. There are also fears that, although cattle from ranches abutting\nKruger's southern borders first introduced the disease to buffalo, now there\nis a reverse danger of buffalo and other smaller species re-infecting\ndomestic livestock.\nMore serious is the fact that humans can contract TB from the bovine strain.\nResidents of villages living on the borders of the parks are particularly at\nrisk because many of them poach illegally for subsistence purposes and can\ncontract the disease from undercooked meat of infected animals. By extension\nit was even possible that visitors to game parks who eat contaminated meat\nmight contract this form of tuberculosis.\nScientists at the symposium acknowledged that drastic action was now\nrequired to contain the epidemic of the late 1990s but admitted that they\nwere hamstrung by a lack of knowledge about the disease and how to cure it\nin animals, especially as there is no effective vaccine for animals. In\naddition, there is no reliable ante-mortem diagnostic way of testing live\nanimals for possible infection except in the case of buffaloes. This\nprevents veterinarians in the park from establishing infection rates in most\nspecies except when carcasses are obtained for post-mortems.\nA serious consequence is that most animals for trans-location cannot be\ntested, raising the prospect of spreading the disease from one reserve to\nanother.\nPrevalence in Kuger's herds range from\nfive percent to 90 percent with herds south of the Sabi River being most\nheavily affected. The prevalence rate declines northwards and veterinarians\nin the park believe the disease has reached to somewhere between the\nOlifants and Luvuvhu Rivers. There is also concern that smaller species\nmight contract, host, and spread the TB bacteria.\nScientific research conducted at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute,\nprimarily by Anita Michel, indicates that there are 17 strain of bovine\ntuberculosis in the Kruger Park.

Kruger\nauthorities will then consider shooting out the most heavily infected herds.\nThe Mpumalanga Parks Board is preparing to either eliminate the entire\nherd of 350 to 400 buffalo in its Mthethomusha Game Reserve that abuts on\nthe south-western border of Kruger or to shoot the most heavily infected herds.\nBoth the Kruger and Mpumalanga park authorities have set up sterilised bomas\n[corrals where they will place pregnant buffalo cows in quarantine-like\nconditions so that they can breed a reservoir of TB-free buffalo to\nrepopulate areas where heavy culling might have to occur. The consequences\nof the epidemic are potentially critical for conservation and the protection\nof biodiversity in South Africa. Other game reserves are indicating a\nreluctance to purchase wild-caught game from Kruger and Hluhluwe, fearing\nthey may be contaminated. This is likely to cause revenue problems for\nreserves that rely on sale of wild game to bolster their conservation work.\nPlans to create large transfrontier conservation areas, popularly known as\npeace parks, between South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are in jeopardy\nas neighbouring states are reluctant to drop their game fences and run the\nrisk of their animals becoming infected. \"Practically, tuberculosis may move\nacross the borders of infected premises in either direction, and infected\nanimals on either side may thus remain a persistent source of infection that\nwill serve to maintain the infection and serve as sources of re-infection,\"\nsays Kriek. There are also fears that, although cattle from ranches abutting\nKruger's southern borders first introduced the disease to buffalo, now there\nis a reverse danger of buffalo and other smaller species re-infecting\ndomestic livestock.\nMore serious is the fact that humans can contract TB from the bovine strain.\nResidents of villages living on the borders of the parks are particularly at\nrisk because many of them poach illegally for subsistence purposes and can\ncontract the disease from undercooked meat of infected animals. By extension\nit was even possible that visitors to game parks who eat contaminated meat\nmight contract this form of tuberculosis.\nScientists at the symposium acknowledged that drastic action was now\nrequired to contain the epidemic of the late 1990s but admitted that they\nwere hamstrung by a lack of knowledge about the disease and how to cure it\nin animals, especially as there is no effective vaccine for animals. In\naddition, there is no reliable ante-mortem diagnostic way of testing live\nanimals for possible infection except in the case of buffaloes. This\nprevents veterinarians in the park from establishing infection rates in most\nspecies except when carcasses are obtained for post-mortems.\nA serious consequence is that most animals for trans-location cannot be\ntested, raising the prospect of spreading the disease from one reserve to\nanother.\nPrevalence in Kuger's herds range from\nfive percent to 90 percent with herds south of the Sabi River being most\nheavily affected.

The Manitoba\nherd was recently destroyed. \"Canadian officials have informed us that\nseven cattle from that herd were sold earlier as part of a group of 82 head\nto North Dakota buyers last May,\" Schuler said. \"These buyers' ranches are\nnow quarantined and the operators are co-operating with us to determine if\nother animals may have been exposed.\" It is not yet known if any of the\nseven heifers from the Manitoba herd were in fact infected with TB, but\nSchuler said that when the Rossburn herd was destroyed, more than 50 per\ncent of the animals were found to have lung lesions caused by TB.\nThe TB outbreak was initially detected at a Long Prairie, Manitoba,\nslaughter plant when lung lesions were spotted on carcasses, which were\nthen traced back to Rossburn. Dr. Anne Scully, Bottineau, a veterinarian\nwith the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService, has completed an epidemiological study of the two North Dakota\nranches and has determined that no livestock in the surrounding area have\nbeen exposed.\nThe two North Dakota buyers later sold the 82 head of cattle, including the\nseven heifers from the affected herd, at a South Dakota auction market on\nSeptember 23, 1997. The auction house is currently reviewing its records to\nlocate the buyers and South Dakota officials have been informed of the\nsituation. Schuler said it is important to trace all contacts that the\nseven heifers may have had with other animals to ensure the disease has not\nentered the state. \"North Dakota has enjoyed a tuberculosis-free status\nsince the early 1980s,\" he said. \"We are working to maintain this status\nwhich saves our livestock producers thousands of dollars annually in\ntesting costs and paperwork.\"\nBovine tuberculosis is a respiratory disease, causing lung lesions, wasting\nand eventual death of infected animals.

I have seen that tuberculosis is now widely spread in the\nshorelines, or all the regions on the shore.\nI can't see how we would know where tuberculosis started in Irian Jaya\nbecause before the Dutch occupation, I am sure that people in the northern\nshore had been trading with other Islands of the Indonesian Archipelago.\nIn the central highlands which is isolated from surface access,\ntuberculosis is not [seen as much. In the Capital of the central\nhighlands, Wamena, we [see a few [cases, but in the sub district\n[surrounding area ? I found very few [cases of\ntuberculosis (1-2 cases per /12,000 inhabitants). [The cases that I have\nobserved are mostly newcomers from the shore or [those who have close\ncontact to people from\nshore.\nA tuberculosis program has been running for more than 7 years now, which\n[provides free medication for patients with positive sputum [smears for\nacid-fast bacilli (AFB). Despite this, compliance of patients are poor.\nThe main issue is how to spread the program, how to detect [infected\npersons, and do\n[epidemiological surveillance. We have enough medicine [to expand the\nprogram, but we don't have enough training and people to do surveillance\nand lab work.\n--\nDr. Bachti Alisjahbana\nResident in Internal Medicine,\nMedical Faculty, University Of Padjadjaran Bandung\nJl, Sulanjana 11A, Bandung, 40116, Indonesia\n[Thanks to all who have contributed to the discussion of this situation,\nand especially to Dr. Alisjahbana for offering the perspective of the\npracticing physician in Indonesia.
