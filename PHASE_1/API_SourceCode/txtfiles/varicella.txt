A detainee \"pod,\" which is a prison housing unit consisting of individual cells, was quarantined for weeks after an outbreak in October [2018].\n\nNow 2 pods have been quarantined for 21 days because of the virus, said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an e-mail. Paez did not answer additional questions about why a 2nd outbreak had occurred, or what the facility, which is managed by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was doing to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nBut today, 31 Jan 2019, I [article author Chris Walker] met a detainee at the facility who described what it was like being under quarantine during last fall's outbreak. From behind a glass partition in the center's visitor room, [MA], age 34 years, described how guards one day told his pod, which housed 77 detainees, that they couldn't leave their housing unit, offering no explanation. \"We had no idea what was going on,\" [MA] recalls. \"Guards just told us that we had to wait.\"\n\nThey wound up waiting for a few days, during which they couldn't access the recreation yard, see visitors, consult face-to-face with lawyers, or even attend their immigration hearings. About a week in, the detainees finally learned that they were under a medical quarantine because of a possible chicken pox outbreak, [MA] says. The potentially sick individuals had been removed from the housing unit before it was locked down. And weeks into the quarantine, a doctor still had not visited the pod. Exasperated, [MA] and about 60 other detainees wrote letters to ICE and the GEO Group demanding answers -- and to see a doctor.\n\nHere's the letter:\n\n\"It has been 2 weeks now that we have been in quarantine and not one doctor has been sent to this pod to offer medical treatment for the chicken pox. The first 3 people that were infected have been treated, cured and were switched over to a different pod, and are now living their normal process. But we have no visits, deportations, and our court [hearings] are being delayed.\n\n\"They won't exchange our blankets, give haircuts, and we are prohibited from having rec time in the yard. We are being exposed to dangerous medical conditions living like this, causing depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and conditions that could be fatal.\n\n\"The most difficult part is the court dates being rescheduled. Many of us have already had chicken pox or been vaccinated. Our immigration process is being delayed because this outbreak wasn't properly handled from the start, and it's not fair. It feels like medical resources don't want to be used on us because we don't deserve it. We are all in desperate need of help.\"\n\nA doctor finally visited the pod, dressed in a full-body hazmat suit \"looking like an astronaut,\" says [MA].\n\nSome of the information that [MA] provided about the October 2018 outbreak (at least the number of individuals who were quarantined) runs counter to what ICE had told media outlets, including Westword, at the time. \"Of the 77 detainees who were tested, medical staff diagnosed 3 detainees with varicella; 7 others had low immunity and therefore possessed increased risk factors of contracting the disease; all 10 were quarantined at the facility,\" spokesman Carl Rusnok said in a statement. \"The Aurora medical staff continues to provide high-level care to all those affected, while at the same time continuing to serve the medical needs of the entire facility population.\"\n\nMultiple requests for comment sent to ICE about the 2nd outbreak haven't been returned; if and when they are, we'll update this story.\n\n[Byline: Chris Walker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This situation is unacceptable and entirely preventable. Why were all residents not vaccinated during the outbreak in October 2018? The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. Will they be released from quarantine after this time period? Disease spreads easily when people are housed in overcrowded tight quarters, such as the situation at these detention centers. Many people who cross the border already need treatment for diseases (like chickenpox, tuberculosis), and sanitation is a big problem. These pathogens are highly transmissible. Vaccines need to be administered, and more individual medical attention is needed to prevent exposure of the group to an infectious individual.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security agency that operates detention centers, states on its website that:\n1.

In addition to the rash, common symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and headache.\n\nMost people are immune to chickenpox due to previous childhood vaccination or history of disease, Truman said. But college officials will review students' immunization records and contact those who might be at risk, according to a health alert on the college's website.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nVermont, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/367]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nVaricella update (17): USA (NC) USA-Mexico border 20181202.6176410\nVaricella update (16): USA (NC) 20181118.6152386\nVaricella update (15): Yemen (HJ) susp., RFI 20181109.6136191\nVaricella update (14): USA (WA) 20181022.6103936\nVaricella update (13): USA (SC) 20180805.5948203\nVaricella update (12): Colombia (Medellin) 20180724.5924859\nVaricella update (11): India (Jamshedpur, JH) 20180630.5883632\nVaricella update (10): India (Hyderabad), Nepal (Kathmandu) 20180506.5787390\nVaricella update (09): Canada, shingles increase 20180426.5769609\nVaricella update (08): UK (England) necrotizing retinitis 20180418.5754188\nVaricella update (07): Mexico (YU) vaccination sequelae 20180410.5736721\nVaricella update (06): Australia (NS), USA (LA), South America (Venezuela) 20180331.5720582\nVaricella update (05): USA (IL) India (OR) 20180320.5699550\nVaricella update (04): South Asia (Sri Lanka) university closure 20180315.5687588\nVaricella update (03): shingles research, India alert 20180222.5645052\nVaricella update (02): USA (NY) background 20180207.5612848\nVaricella update (01): USA (NY) 20180204.5606488\n2017\n----\nVaricella update (02): India, USA (MN) 20171214.5503292\n.................................................sb/lk/rd/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis", "varicella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2019-01-31 00:00:00", "2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2019-01-31 00:00:00", "2018-10-16 00:00:00", "2018-10-16 00:00:00", "0209-01-30 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2019-01-30 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Medellin", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "Nepal", "country": "Nepal"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Venezuela", "country": "Venezuela"}, {"location": "Vermont", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Randolph", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yemen", "country": "Yemen"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Sri Lanka", "country": "Sri Lanka"}, {"location": "US", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Colombia", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Aurora", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "LA", "country": "Bolivia"}, {"location": "SC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kathmandu", "country": "Nepal"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6533469", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Varicella update (07): USA (CA) France", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6533469", "date": "2019-02-01 18:23:08", "main_text": "VARICELLA UPDATE (01): USA (COLORADO, VERMONT)\n**********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Colorado (Aurora)\n[2] Vermont (Randolph)\n\n******\n[1] Colorado (Aurora): ICE processing center\nDate: Thu 31 Jan 2019\nSource: Westword [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/second-chicken-pox-outbreak-at-aurora-immigrant-detention-center-puts-two-pods-in-quarantine-11210867\n\n\nThere has been another chicken pox [varicella] outbreak at the immigrant detention center in Aurora, the 2nd in just 3 months.

A detainee \"pod,\" which is a prison housing unit consisting of individual cells, was quarantined for weeks after an outbreak in October [2018].\n\nNow 2 pods have been quarantined for 21 days because of the virus, said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an e-mail. Paez did not answer additional questions about why a 2nd outbreak had occurred, or what the facility, which is managed by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was doing to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nBut today, 31 Jan 2019, I [article author Chris Walker] met a detainee at the facility who described what it was like being under quarantine during last fall's outbreak. From behind a glass partition in the center's visitor room, [MA], age 34 years, described how guards one day told his pod, which housed 77 detainees, that they couldn't leave their housing unit, offering no explanation. \"We had no idea what was going on,\" [MA] recalls. \"Guards just told us that we had to wait.\"\n\nThey wound up waiting for a few days, during which they couldn't access the recreation yard, see visitors, consult face-to-face with lawyers, or even attend their immigration hearings. About a week in, the detainees finally learned that they were under a medical quarantine because of a possible chicken pox outbreak, [MA] says. The potentially sick individuals had been removed from the housing unit before it was locked down. And weeks into the quarantine, a doctor still had not visited the pod. Exasperated, [MA] and about 60 other detainees wrote letters to ICE and the GEO Group demanding answers -- and to see a doctor.\n\nHere's the letter:\n\n\"It has been 2 weeks now that we have been in quarantine and not one doctor has been sent to this pod to offer medical treatment for the chicken pox. The first 3 people that were infected have been treated, cured and were switched over to a different pod, and are now living their normal process. But we have no visits, deportations, and our court [hearings] are being delayed.\n\n\"They won't exchange our blankets, give haircuts, and we are prohibited from having rec time in the yard. We are being exposed to dangerous medical conditions living like this, causing depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and conditions that could be fatal.\n\n\"The most difficult part is the court dates being rescheduled. Many of us have already had chicken pox or been vaccinated. Our immigration process is being delayed because this outbreak wasn't properly handled from the start, and it's not fair. It feels like medical resources don't want to be used on us because we don't deserve it. We are all in desperate need of help.\"\n\nA doctor finally visited the pod, dressed in a full-body hazmat suit \"looking like an astronaut,\" says [MA].\n\nSome of the information that [MA] provided about the October 2018 outbreak (at least the number of individuals who were quarantined) runs counter to what ICE had told media outlets, including Westword, at the time. \"Of the 77 detainees who were tested, medical staff diagnosed 3 detainees with varicella; 7 others had low immunity and therefore possessed increased risk factors of contracting the disease; all 10 were quarantined at the facility,\" spokesman Carl Rusnok said in a statement. \"The Aurora medical staff continues to provide high-level care to all those affected, while at the same time continuing to serve the medical needs of the entire facility population.\"\n\nMultiple requests for comment sent to ICE about the 2nd outbreak haven't been returned; if and when they are, we'll update this story.\n\n[Byline: Chris Walker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This situation is unacceptable and entirely preventable. Why were all residents not vaccinated during the outbreak in October 2018? The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. Will they be released from quarantine after this time period? Disease spreads easily when people are housed in overcrowded tight quarters, such as the situation at these detention centers. Many people who cross the border already need treatment for diseases (like chickenpox, tuberculosis), and sanitation is a big problem. These pathogens are highly transmissible.

A detainee \"pod,\" which is a prison housing unit consisting of individual cells, was quarantined for weeks after an outbreak in October [2018].\n\nNow 2 pods have been quarantined for 21 days because of the virus, said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an e-mail. Paez did not answer additional questions about why a 2nd outbreak had occurred, or what the facility, which is managed by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was doing to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nBut today, 31 Jan 2019, I [article author Chris Walker] met a detainee at the facility who described what it was like being under quarantine during last fall's outbreak. From behind a glass partition in the center's visitor room, [MA], age 34 years, described how guards one day told his pod, which housed 77 detainees, that they couldn't leave their housing unit, offering no explanation. \"We had no idea what was going on,\" [MA] recalls. \"Guards just told us that we had to wait.\"\n\nThey wound up waiting for a few days, during which they couldn't access the recreation yard, see visitors, consult face-to-face with lawyers, or even attend their immigration hearings. About a week in, the detainees finally learned that they were under a medical quarantine because of a possible chicken pox outbreak, [MA] says. The potentially sick individuals had been removed from the housing unit before it was locked down. And weeks into the quarantine, a doctor still had not visited the pod. Exasperated, [MA] and about 60 other detainees wrote letters to ICE and the GEO Group demanding answers -- and to see a doctor.\n\nHere's the letter:\n\n\"It has been 2 weeks now that we have been in quarantine and not one doctor has been sent to this pod to offer medical treatment for the chicken pox. The first 3 people that were infected have been treated, cured and were switched over to a different pod, and are now living their normal process. But we have no visits, deportations, and our court [hearings] are being delayed.\n\n\"They won't exchange our blankets, give haircuts, and we are prohibited from having rec time in the yard. We are being exposed to dangerous medical conditions living like this, causing depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and conditions that could be fatal.\n\n\"The most difficult part is the court dates being rescheduled. Many of us have already had chicken pox or been vaccinated. Our immigration process is being delayed because this outbreak wasn't properly handled from the start, and it's not fair. It feels like medical resources don't want to be used on us because we don't deserve it. We are all in desperate need of help.\"\n\nA doctor finally visited the pod, dressed in a full-body hazmat suit \"looking like an astronaut,\" says [MA].\n\nSome of the information that [MA] provided about the October 2018 outbreak (at least the number of individuals who were quarantined) runs counter to what ICE had told media outlets, including Westword, at the time. \"Of the 77 detainees who were tested, medical staff diagnosed 3 detainees with varicella; 7 others had low immunity and therefore possessed increased risk factors of contracting the disease; all 10 were quarantined at the facility,\" spokesman Carl Rusnok said in a statement. \"The Aurora medical staff continues to provide high-level care to all those affected, while at the same time continuing to serve the medical needs of the entire facility population.\"\n\nMultiple requests for comment sent to ICE about the 2nd outbreak haven't been returned; if and when they are, we'll update this story.\n\n[Byline: Chris Walker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This situation is unacceptable and entirely preventable. Why were all residents not vaccinated during the outbreak in October 2018? The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. Will they be released from quarantine after this time period? Disease spreads easily when people are housed in overcrowded tight quarters, such as the situation at these detention centers. Many people who cross the border already need treatment for diseases (like chickenpox, tuberculosis), and sanitation is a big problem. These pathogens are highly transmissible.

But college officials will review students' immunization records and contact those who might be at risk, according to a health alert on the college's website.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nVermont, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/367]\nSee Also\n2018\n----\nVaricella update (17): USA (NC) USA-Mexico border 20181202.6176410\nVaricella update (16): USA (NC) 20181118.6152386\nVaricella update (15): Yemen (HJ) susp., RFI 20181109.6136191\nVaricella update (14): USA (WA) 20181022.6103936\nVaricella update (13): USA (SC) 20180805.5948203\nVaricella update (12): Colombia (Medellin) 20180724.5924859\nVaricella update (11): India (Jamshedpur, JH) 20180630.5883632\nVaricella update (10): India (Hyderabad), Nepal (Kathmandu) 20180506.5787390\nVaricella update (09): Canada, shingles increase 20180426.5769609\nVaricella update (08): UK (England) necrotizing retinitis 20180418.5754188\nVaricella update (07): Mexico (YU) vaccination sequelae 20180410.5736721\nVaricella update (06): Australia (NS), USA (LA), South America (Venezuela) 20180331.5720582\nVaricella update (05): USA (IL) India (OR) 20180320.5699550\nVaricella update (04): South Asia (Sri Lanka) university closure 20180315.5687588\nVaricella update (03): shingles research, India alert 20180222.5645052\nVaricella update (02): USA (NY) background 20180207.5612848\nVaricella update (01): USA (NY) 20180204.5606488\n2017\n----\nVaricella update (02): India, USA (MN) 20171214.5503292\n.................................................sb/lk/rd/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tuberculosis", "varicella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2019-01-31 00:00:00", "2021-10-16 00:00:00", "2019-01-31 00:00:00", "2018-10-16 00:00:00", "2018-10-16 00:00:00", "0209-01-30 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2019-01-30 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Medellin", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "Nepal", "country": "Nepal"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Venezuela", "country": "Venezuela"}, {"location": "Vermont", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Randolph", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yemen", "country": "Yemen"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "Mexico"}, {"location": "Sri Lanka", "country": "Sri Lanka"}, {"location": "US", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Colombia", "country": "Colombia"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Aurora", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "LA", "country": "Bolivia"}, {"location": "SC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kathmandu", "country": "Nepal"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6290432", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Varicella update (01): USA (CO, VT)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6290432", "date": "2019-02-01 18:23:08", "main_text": "VARICELLA UPDATE (01): USA (COLORADO, VERMONT)\n**********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Colorado (Aurora)\n[2] Vermont (Randolph)\n\n******\n[1] Colorado (Aurora): ICE processing center\nDate: Thu 31 Jan 2019\nSource: Westword [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/second-chicken-pox-outbreak-at-aurora-immigrant-detention-center-puts-two-pods-in-quarantine-11210867\n\n\nThere has been another chicken pox [varicella] outbreak at the immigrant detention center in Aurora, the 2nd in just 3 months. A detainee \"pod,\" which is a prison housing unit consisting of individual cells, was quarantined for weeks after an outbreak in October [2018].\n\nNow 2 pods have been quarantined for 21 days because of the virus, said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an e-mail. Paez did not answer additional questions about why a 2nd outbreak had occurred, or what the facility, which is managed by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was doing to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nBut today, 31 Jan 2019, I [article author Chris Walker] met a detainee at the facility who described what it was like being under quarantine during last fall's outbreak. From behind a glass partition in the center's visitor room, [MA], age 34 years, described how guards one day told his pod, which housed 77 detainees, that they couldn't leave their housing unit, offering no explanation. \"We had no idea what was going on,\" [MA] recalls. \"Guards just told us that we had to wait.\"\n\nThey wound up waiting for a few days, during which they couldn't access the recreation yard, see visitors, consult face-to-face with lawyers, or even attend their immigration hearings. About a week in, the detainees finally learned that they were under a medical quarantine because of a possible chicken pox outbreak, [MA] says. The potentially sick individuals had been removed from the housing unit before it was locked down. And weeks into the quarantine, a doctor still had not visited the pod. Exasperated, [MA] and about 60 other detainees wrote letters to ICE and the GEO Group demanding answers -- and to see a doctor.\n\nHere's the letter:\n\n\"It has been 2 weeks now that we have been in quarantine and not one doctor has been sent to this pod to offer medical treatment for the chicken pox. The first 3 people that were infected have been treated, cured and were switched over to a different pod, and are now living their normal process. But we have no visits, deportations, and our court [hearings] are being delayed.\n\n\"They won't exchange our blankets, give haircuts, and we are prohibited from having rec time in the yard. We are being exposed to dangerous medical conditions living like this, causing depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and conditions that could be fatal.\n\n\"The most difficult part is the court dates being rescheduled. Many of us have already had chicken pox or been vaccinated. Our immigration process is being delayed because this outbreak wasn't properly handled from the start, and it's not fair. It feels like medical resources don't want to be used on us because we don't deserve it. We are all in desperate need of help.\"\n\nA doctor finally visited the pod, dressed in a full-body hazmat suit \"looking like an astronaut,\" says [MA].\n\nSome of the information that [MA] provided about the October 2018 outbreak (at least the number of individuals who were quarantined) runs counter to what ICE had told media outlets, including Westword, at the time. \"Of the 77 detainees who were tested, medical staff diagnosed 3 detainees with varicella; 7 others had low immunity and therefore possessed increased risk factors of contracting the disease; all 10 were quarantined at the facility,\" spokesman Carl Rusnok said in a statement. \"The Aurora medical staff continues to provide high-level care to all those affected, while at the same time continuing to serve the medical needs of the entire facility population.\"\n\nMultiple requests for comment sent to ICE about the 2nd outbreak haven't been returned; if and when they are, we'll update this story.\n\n[Byline: Chris Walker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This situation is unacceptable and entirely preventable. Why were all residents not vaccinated during the outbreak in October 2018? The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. Will they be released from quarantine after this time period? Disease spreads easily when people are housed in overcrowded tight quarters, such as the situation at these detention centers. Many people who cross the border already need treatment for diseases (like chickenpox, tuberculosis), and sanitation is a big problem. These pathogens are highly transmissible. Vaccines need to be administered, and more individual medical attention is needed to prevent exposure of the group to an infectious individual.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security agency that operates detention centers, states on its website that:\n1. Residents will have access to health care education and maintenance services that are determined by the health care authority to be necessary and appropriate. Services will include prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of medical, dental, and mental health conditions.\n2. Newly admitted residents will be informed how to access health services, in a language they can understand.\n3. Residents will be able to initiate requests for health services.\n4. Residents will have access to the care determined necessary by the health care authority from a resident's admission to the residential facility until they are discharged from treatment, transferred to another facility, or removed from the US.

Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide. Bulletin of the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/ doi: 10.2471/BLT.07.040089). This bulletin provides an excellent summary of the benefits of vaccines. While elimination of smallpox may be the best example of a successful vaccine, data for efficacy of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are given below. These vaccine-preventable diseases still occur, largely because of vaccine hesitancy, but disease severity and mortality are greatly reduced.\n\nBefore the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; and of these, 400-500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99 percent reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html).\n\nBefore the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html).\n\nBefore the rubella vaccination program started in 1969, rubella was a common and widespread infection in the United States. During the last major rubella epidemic in the United States from 1964-1965, an estimated 12.5 million people got rubella, 11 000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2100 newborns died, and 20 000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Once the vaccine became widely used, the number of people infected with rubella in the United States dropped dramatically. Today, [fewer] than 10 people in the United States are reported as having rubella each year. Since 2012, all rubella cases had evidence that they were infected when they were living or traveling outside the United States (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/in-the-us.html).\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nNew York, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31193\nNew York county map: http://geology.com/county-map/new-york-county-map.gif]\nSee Also\nVaricella update (01): USA (NY) 20180204.5606488\n2017\n----\nVaricella update (02): India, USA (MN) 20171214.5503292\n.................................................lk/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella", "smallpox", "varicella", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "1963-03-16 00:00:00", "1967-03-16 00:00:00", "1989-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1969-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW YORK", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "US", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Gideon", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5754188", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Varicella update (08): UK (England) necrotizing retinitis", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5754188", "date": "2018-02-07 11:19:20", "main_text": "VARICELLA UPDATE (02): USA (NEW YORK) BACKGROUND\n************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 5 Feb 2018\nFrom: Steve Berger <steve@gideononline.com> [edited]\n\n\nre: ProMED-mail Varicella update (01): USA (NY) 20180204.5606488\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFor over 50 years, deaths due to varicella in the United States have exceeded deaths from measles, mumps, and rubella.

Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide. Bulletin of the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/ doi: 10.2471/BLT.07.040089). This bulletin provides an excellent summary of the benefits of vaccines. While elimination of smallpox may be the best example of a successful vaccine, data for efficacy of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are given below. These vaccine-preventable diseases still occur, largely because of vaccine hesitancy, but disease severity and mortality are greatly reduced.\n\nBefore the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; and of these, 400-500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99 percent reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html).\n\nBefore the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html).\n\nBefore the rubella vaccination program started in 1969, rubella was a common and widespread infection in the United States. During the last major rubella epidemic in the United States from 1964-1965, an estimated 12.5 million people got rubella, 11 000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2100 newborns died, and 20 000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Once the vaccine became widely used, the number of people infected with rubella in the United States dropped dramatically.

Bulletin of the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/ doi: 10.2471/BLT.07.040089). This bulletin provides an excellent summary of the benefits of vaccines. While elimination of smallpox may be the best example of a successful vaccine, data for efficacy of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are given below. These vaccine-preventable diseases still occur, largely because of vaccine hesitancy, but disease severity and mortality are greatly reduced.\n\nBefore the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; and of these, 400-500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99 percent reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html).\n\nBefore the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html).\n\nBefore the rubella vaccination program started in 1969, rubella was a common and widespread infection in the United States. During the last major rubella epidemic in the United States from 1964-1965, an estimated 12.5 million people got rubella, 11 000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2100 newborns died, and 20 000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

[Wed 17 May 2017] saw yet another case when a man at the Allied Hospital succumbed to the largely benign but infectious illness. By some accounts, the death toll over the past few weeks alone exceeded 20. Exact figures are difficult to come by, and therein lies the problem: far from the provincial administration, immediately coming up with a plan to spread information about the illness and providing training on diagnosing and managing the infection to medical staff at all health centres, including the smaller ones in the rural areas, action has been limited to very few medical facilities.\n\nThe problems in controlling such an outbreak are manifold including the citizenry's own lack of awareness in seeking sound medical advice when symptoms begin to manifest themselves and its propensity to seek the help of unqualified 'medics' for fear of long queues at public-sector facilities. But it has also been reported that the condition of patients who approached smaller state-run facilities, including Basic Health Units [BHU] and Rural Health Centres, was often misdiagnosed.\n\nThat in Pakistan's most well-funded province people are dying of an illness that is not considered dangerous, unless there are complications, and for which a vaccine is also available is appalling. The Faisalabad commissioner has said that health department officials have been asked to make isolation beds functional at tehsil headquarters hospitals and BHUs, ensure the provision of equipment and medicines, and gather data from private medical facilities. It is to be hoped that such steps are taken on an urgent footing, with officialdom spurred on by the knowledge that many needless deaths have already occurred.

The link among the cases appeared to be the school bus that all 4 children rode to and from school each day, according to the report. The kids didn't interact socially in school or have classes or lunch together, the researchers noted.\n\nChickenpox outbreaks are rare, because most children are now vaccinated against the virus. At the school in the report, 95 percent of the students were fully vaccinated, meaning they had received both doses of the vaccine, as recommended, the researchers said. Another 3 percent of students at the school had received one shot, the researchers noted.\n\nNo other cases of chickenpox were diagnosed in the school for the rest of the year, according to the report.\n\nThe health officials investigating the outbreak revealed that the 1st child to get sick had not been vaccinated, and that the child's 4 siblings (also unvaccinated) had all also recently been kept home from school because of a rash that looked like chickenpox.\n\nAmong the 3 children who likely caught the virus on the school bus, one had been fully vaccinated, according to the report. Full vaccination is between 88 and 98 percent effective at preventing chickenpox, according to the CDC.\n\nThe other 2 children, who were siblings, had not been vaccinated, the investigators wrote. Those children later spread chickenpox to their 17-month-old sibling, according to the report.\n\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The same virus also causes shingles in adults. In this case, a shingles infection turned out to be the source of the chickenpox infection: The 1st child's parent had a shingles infection several weeks before the children developed chickenpox, according to the report.\n\nBefore the chickenpox vaccine was developed, the virus spread easily from kid to kid, especially in schools. However, now that most kids are vaccinated against the virus, it may be increasingly likely that kids, particularly those who are unvaccinated, will get the virus from adults who have shingles, rather than from other kids, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers mentioned only one previous report, which occurred in China, of chickenpox spreading on a school bus. Because school buses put kids in close proximity to each other, however, doctors and public health officials investigating similar outbreaks might want to consider these vehicles as a possible risk factor, the report said.\n\n[Byline: Sara G. Miller]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chickenpox is most contagious from 2 to 3 days before the rash appears until all the blisters have crusted over. So in those early infectious days, the disease is not evident and transmission readily occurs. About 14 to 16 days after contact with a person infected with the virus, the 1st symptoms of chickenpox usually develop. Most people feel sick and have a fever, a decreased appetite, a headache, a cough, and a sore throat. Some children get the chickenpox rash without 1st having the early symptoms.\n\nThe chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster) can spread easily from one person to another. It most often spreads through the respiratory tract, such as mucous membranes of the mouth and nose. You also can get chickenpox through the air from an infected person's sneezing or coughing. Less often, chickenpox is spread when fluid from a chickenpox blister gets on your skin. In rare cases, a person can get chickenpox from the fluid of shingles blisters [which appears to be the origin of the first case described above].\n\nThe chickenpox vaccine is more than 95 percent effective in preventing a severe chickenpox infection. However, 10 to 30 percent of children who have received the vaccine will develop mild chickenpox symptoms after exposure to a person with chickenpox.\n\nA map of the United States showing the location of Michigan can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3087.]\nSee Also\nVaricella - Nepal: (KT) seasonality 20160803.4391076\nVaricella - Colombia: (ME) prison 20160729.4377832\nVaricella - USA (03): (CA) shingles 20160727.4371715\nVaricella (04): inverse relationship with glioma 20160604.4265732\nVaricella (03): USA (New York City), India (New Delhi) 20160519.4233123\nVaricella - USA: (MI) 20160501.4195072\nVaricella - India (02): (PB) 20160415.4158643\nVaricella, MRSA - USA: (MI,PA) school children 20160403.4135512\nVaricella: Caribbean (Grenada), USA (NC) schoolchildren 20160308.4078236\nVaricella-zoster vaccine-associated keratitis: RFI 20160303.4067633\nVaricella - India: (WB) law school students 20160208.4004489\n2015\n----\nChickenpox - Nepal (02): (BN) 20150908.3631748\nChickenpox - Nepal: (KT) post-earthquake 20150505.3343420\n2014\n----\nChickenpox - India (03): (OR) fatal 20141109.2941349\nChickenpox - India (02): (JH) 20140520.2484869\nChickenpox - India: (MP) 20140516.2477950\nChickenpox - Thailand: children 20140210.2268350\n2012\n----\nChickenpox - India (02): (Chennai) 20120415.1102085\nChickenpox- India: (Mumbai) 20120225.1052634\n2011\n----\nChickenpox, children - India (02): (AS) 20110513.1467\nChickenpox, children - India: (AS) 20110511.1453\n.................................................sb/lk/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "varicella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-09-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Grenada", "country": "Grenada"}, {"location": "New Delhi", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Mumbai", "country": "India"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Muskegon County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Michigan", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4958753", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Varicella - Pakistan: (PB)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4958753", "date": "2016-09-10 22:29:35", "main_text": "VARICELLA - USA (04): (MICHIGAN)\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 8 Sep 2016\nSource: Live Science [edited]\nhttp://www.livescience.com/56031-chickenpox-school-bus.html\n\n\nChickenpox Virus Spreads Through School Bus\n-------------------------------------------\nA small outbreak of chickenpox was traced back to a single school bus in Michigan, and highlights the importance giving kids the chickenpox vaccine, according to a new report.\n\nHealth officials in rural Muskegon County, Michigan, were alerted to a suspected case of the chickenpox in an 8-year-old last December [2015] after the child was sent home from school, according to the report of the outbreak from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published today (8 Sep 2016).\n\nShortly afterward, 3 more kids came down with the illness, the researchers wrote.

Another 3 percent of students at the school had received one shot, the researchers noted.\n\nNo other cases of chickenpox were diagnosed in the school for the rest of the year, according to the report.\n\nThe health officials investigating the outbreak revealed that the 1st child to get sick had not been vaccinated, and that the child's 4 siblings (also unvaccinated) had all also recently been kept home from school because of a rash that looked like chickenpox.\n\nAmong the 3 children who likely caught the virus on the school bus, one had been fully vaccinated, according to the report. Full vaccination is between 88 and 98 percent effective at preventing chickenpox, according to the CDC.\n\nThe other 2 children, who were siblings, had not been vaccinated, the investigators wrote. Those children later spread chickenpox to their 17-month-old sibling, according to the report.\n\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The same virus also causes shingles in adults. In this case, a shingles infection turned out to be the source of the chickenpox infection: The 1st child's parent had a shingles infection several weeks before the children developed chickenpox, according to the report.\n\nBefore the chickenpox vaccine was developed, the virus spread easily from kid to kid, especially in schools. However, now that most kids are vaccinated against the virus, it may be increasingly likely that kids, particularly those who are unvaccinated, will get the virus from adults who have shingles, rather than from other kids, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers mentioned only one previous report, which occurred in China, of chickenpox spreading on a school bus. Because school buses put kids in close proximity to each other, however, doctors and public health officials investigating similar outbreaks might want to consider these vehicles as a possible risk factor, the report said.\n\n[Byline: Sara G.

So in those early infectious days, the disease is not evident and transmission readily occurs. About 14 to 16 days after contact with a person infected with the virus, the 1st symptoms of chickenpox usually develop.

The link among the cases appeared to be the school bus that all 4 children rode to and from school each day, according to the report. The kids didn't interact socially in school or have classes or lunch together, the researchers noted.\n\nChickenpox outbreaks are rare, because most children are now vaccinated against the virus. At the school in the report, 95 percent of the students were fully vaccinated, meaning they had received both doses of the vaccine, as recommended, the researchers said. Another 3 percent of students at the school had received one shot, the researchers noted.\n\nNo other cases of chickenpox were diagnosed in the school for the rest of the year, according to the report.\n\nThe health officials investigating the outbreak revealed that the 1st child to get sick had not been vaccinated, and that the child's 4 siblings (also unvaccinated) had all also recently been kept home from school because of a rash that looked like chickenpox.\n\nAmong the 3 children who likely caught the virus on the school bus, one had been fully vaccinated, according to the report. Full vaccination is between 88 and 98 percent effective at preventing chickenpox, according to the CDC.\n\nThe other 2 children, who were siblings, had not been vaccinated, the investigators wrote. Those children later spread chickenpox to their 17-month-old sibling, according to the report.\n\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The same virus also causes shingles in adults. In this case, a shingles infection turned out to be the source of the chickenpox infection: The 1st child's parent had a shingles infection several weeks before the children developed chickenpox, according to the report.\n\nBefore the chickenpox vaccine was developed, the virus spread easily from kid to kid, especially in schools. However, now that most kids are vaccinated against the virus, it may be increasingly likely that kids, particularly those who are unvaccinated, will get the virus from adults who have shingles, rather than from other kids, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers mentioned only one previous report, which occurred in China, of chickenpox spreading on a school bus. Because school buses put kids in close proximity to each other, however, doctors and public health officials investigating similar outbreaks might want to consider these vehicles as a possible risk factor, the report said.\n\n[Byline: Sara G.

So in those early infectious days, the disease is not evident and transmission readily occurs. About 14 to 16 days after contact with a person infected with the virus, the 1st symptoms of chickenpox usually develop. Most people feel sick and have a fever, a decreased appetite, a headache, a cough, and a sore throat.

Of these, 41 (13 percent) were reported by persons younger than 5 years old and 296 (87 percent) were reported by persons older 5 years old.\n\nThese cases were reported by TCI Hospital on Providenciales 234 (72 percent) and Grand Turk 5 (1 percent); with 28 cases in North Caicos and 60 (18 percent) cases in clinics in Providenciales. In summary, the majority cases are being reported from Providenciales (90 percent).\n\nBy comparison, in all of 2015, a total of 98 cases of chickenpox were reported by TCI Hospital in Providenciales.\n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VZV reactivates, herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact, and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash of that usually starts on the abdomen, back, or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then breaks, crusts over, and leaves dry brown scabs.\n\nThe chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered skin rather than exposed. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, and genitals.\n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days).\n\nThis disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare, but include pneumonia, encephalitis, and secondary bacterial infections.\n\nInfection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immunocompromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles.\n\nThe TCI Ministry of Health strongly advises persons affected with chickenpox to remain at home during their sick leave period to prevent further spread of this illness within the community and schools.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family is the causative agent for chickenpox. Humans are the only reservoir of the virus, and disease occurs only in humans. After primary infection as varicella (chickenpox), the virus remains dormant in the sensory-nerve ganglia and can reactivate at a later time, causing herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nVaricella occurs worldwide. In temperate climates, varicella tends to be a childhood disease, with peak incidence among preschool and school-aged children during late winter and early spring. In these countries, less than 5 percent of adults are susceptible to varicella. In tropical climates, the highest incidence was described in the driest, coolest months; overall, infection tends to be acquired later in childhood, resulting in higher susceptibility among adults than in temperate climates, especially in less densely populated areas.\n\nAll people, including those traveling or living abroad, should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those who do not have evidence of immunity or contraindications to vaccination should receive age-appropriate vaccination. Vaccination against varicella is not a requirement for entry into any country (including the United States), but people who do not have evidence of immunity should be considered at risk for varicella during international travel.\n\nVaricella vaccine contains live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is licensed for people aged 12 months and older, and the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine is licensed only for children 1-12 years. CDC recommends varicella vaccination for all people aged 12 months and older without evidence of immunity to varicella who do not have contraindications to the vaccine: 1 dose for children aged 1-4 years and 2 doses for people aged 4 years and older. The minimum interval between doses is 3 months for children aged less than 13 years and 4 weeks for people aged 13 years and older. Contraindications for vaccination include allergy to vaccine components, immune-compromising conditions or treatments, and pregnancy. When evidence of immunity is uncertain, a possible history of varicella is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.

Of these, 41 (13 percent) were reported by persons younger than 5 years old and 296 (87 percent) were reported by persons older 5 years old.\n\nThese cases were reported by TCI Hospital on Providenciales 234 (72 percent) and Grand Turk 5 (1 percent); with 28 cases in North Caicos and 60 (18 percent) cases in clinics in Providenciales. In summary, the majority cases are being reported from Providenciales (90 percent).\n\nBy comparison, in all of 2015, a total of 98 cases of chickenpox were reported by TCI Hospital in Providenciales.\n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VZV reactivates, herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact, and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash of that usually starts on the abdomen, back, or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then breaks, crusts over, and leaves dry brown scabs.\n\nThe chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered skin rather than exposed. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, and genitals.\n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days).\n\nThis disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare, but include pneumonia, encephalitis, and secondary bacterial infections.\n\nInfection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immunocompromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles.\n\nThe TCI Ministry of Health strongly advises persons affected with chickenpox to remain at home during their sick leave period to prevent further spread of this illness within the community and schools.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family is the causative agent for chickenpox. Humans are the only reservoir of the virus, and disease occurs only in humans. After primary infection as varicella (chickenpox), the virus remains dormant in the sensory-nerve ganglia and can reactivate at a later time, causing herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nVaricella occurs worldwide. In temperate climates, varicella tends to be a childhood disease, with peak incidence among preschool and school-aged children during late winter and early spring. In these countries, less than 5 percent of adults are susceptible to varicella. In tropical climates, the highest incidence was described in the driest, coolest months; overall, infection tends to be acquired later in childhood, resulting in higher susceptibility among adults than in temperate climates, especially in less densely populated areas.\n\nAll people, including those traveling or living abroad, should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those who do not have evidence of immunity or contraindications to vaccination should receive age-appropriate vaccination. Vaccination against varicella is not a requirement for entry into any country (including the United States), but people who do not have evidence of immunity should be considered at risk for varicella during international travel.\n\nVaricella vaccine contains live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is licensed for people aged 12 months and older, and the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine is licensed only for children 1-12 years. CDC recommends varicella vaccination for all people aged 12 months and older without evidence of immunity to varicella who do not have contraindications to the vaccine: 1 dose for children aged 1-4 years and 2 doses for people aged 4 years and older. The minimum interval between doses is 3 months for children aged less than 13 years and 4 weeks for people aged 13 years and older. Contraindications for vaccination include allergy to vaccine components, immune-compromising conditions or treatments, and pregnancy. When evidence of immunity is uncertain, a possible history of varicella is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.

Of these, 41 (13 percent) were reported by persons younger than 5 years old and 296 (87 percent) were reported by persons older 5 years old.\n\nThese cases were reported by TCI Hospital on Providenciales 234 (72 percent) and Grand Turk 5 (1 percent); with 28 cases in North Caicos and 60 (18 percent) cases in clinics in Providenciales. In summary, the majority cases are being reported from Providenciales (90 percent).\n\nBy comparison, in all of 2015, a total of 98 cases of chickenpox were reported by TCI Hospital in Providenciales.\n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VZV reactivates, herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact, and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash of that usually starts on the abdomen, back, or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then breaks, crusts over, and leaves dry brown scabs.\n\nThe chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered skin rather than exposed. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, and genitals.\n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days).\n\nThis disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare, but include pneumonia, encephalitis, and secondary bacterial infections.\n\nInfection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immunocompromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles.\n\nThe TCI Ministry of Health strongly advises persons affected with chickenpox to remain at home during their sick leave period to prevent further spread of this illness within the community and schools.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family is the causative agent for chickenpox. Humans are the only reservoir of the virus, and disease occurs only in humans. After primary infection as varicella (chickenpox), the virus remains dormant in the sensory-nerve ganglia and can reactivate at a later time, causing herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nVaricella occurs worldwide. In temperate climates, varicella tends to be a childhood disease, with peak incidence among preschool and school-aged children during late winter and early spring. In these countries, less than 5 percent of adults are susceptible to varicella. In tropical climates, the highest incidence was described in the driest, coolest months; overall, infection tends to be acquired later in childhood, resulting in higher susceptibility among adults than in temperate climates, especially in less densely populated areas.\n\nAll people, including those traveling or living abroad, should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those who do not have evidence of immunity or contraindications to vaccination should receive age-appropriate vaccination. Vaccination against varicella is not a requirement for entry into any country (including the United States), but people who do not have evidence of immunity should be considered at risk for varicella during international travel.\n\nVaricella vaccine contains live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is licensed for people aged 12 months and older, and the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine is licensed only for children 1-12 years. CDC recommends varicella vaccination for all people aged 12 months and older without evidence of immunity to varicella who do not have contraindications to the vaccine: 1 dose for children aged 1-4 years and 2 doses for people aged 4 years and older. The minimum interval between doses is 3 months for children aged less than 13 years and 4 weeks for people aged 13 years and older. Contraindications for vaccination include allergy to vaccine components, immune-compromising conditions or treatments, and pregnancy.

Vaccine effectiveness is approximately 80 percent after 1 dose and 95 percent after 2 doses.\n\n(Excerpted and edited from http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/varicella-chickenpox)\n\nMaps of the Turks and Caicos Islands may be accessed at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/tc.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/48358. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nVaricella - USA: (MI) 20160501.4195072\nVaricella - India (02): (PB) 20160415.4158643\nVaricella, MRSA - USA: (MI,PA) school children 20160403.4135512\nVaricella: Caribbean (Grenada), USA (NC) schoolchildren 20160308.4078236\nVaricella-zoster vaccine-associated keratitis: RFI 20160303.4067633\nVaricella - India: (WB) law school students 20160208.40044892015\n----\nChickenpox - Nepal (02): (BN) 20150908.3631748\nChickenpox - Nepal: (KT) post-earthquake 20150505.3343420\n2014\n----\nChickenpox - India (03): (OR) fatal 20141109.2941349\nChickenpox - India (02): (JH) 20140520.2484869\nChickenpox - India: (MP) 20140516.2477950\nChickenpox - Thailand: children 20140210.2268350\n2012\n----\nChickenpox - India (02): (Chennai) 20120415.1102085\nChickenpox- India: (Mumbai) 20120225.1052634\n2011\n----\nChickenpox, children - India (02): (AS) 20110513.1467\nChickenpox, children - India: (AS) 20110511.1453\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["measles", "mumps", "rubella", "varicella", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-05-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "North Caicos", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Providenciales", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Grenada", "country": "Grenada"}, {"location": "Mumbai", "country": "India"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4215146", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Varicella (02): Caribbean (Turks & Caicos Islands)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4215146", "date": "2016-05-11 11:16:17", "main_text": "VARICELLA (02): CARIBBEAN (TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS)\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 9 May 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/chickenpox-surge-reported-on-turks-and-caicos-providenciales-hit-hardest-80713/\n\n\nHealth officials on the Caribbean island group, Turks and Caicos (TCI), are reporting a significant increase in chickenpox [varicella] cases during the 1st 4 months of 2016.\n\nAs of the end of the week of 23 Apr 2016, a total of 327 cases have been reported for the year. Of these, 41 (13 percent) were reported by persons younger than 5 years old and 296 (87 percent) were reported by persons older 5 years old.\n\nThese cases were reported by TCI Hospital on Providenciales 234 (72 percent) and Grand Turk 5 (1 percent); with 28 cases in North Caicos and 60 (18 percent) cases in clinics in Providenciales. In summary, the majority cases are being reported from Providenciales (90 percent).\n\nBy comparison, in all of 2015, a total of 98 cases of chickenpox were reported by TCI Hospital in Providenciales.\n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VZV reactivates, herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact, and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash of that usually starts on the abdomen, back, or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then breaks, crusts over, and leaves dry brown scabs.\n\nThe chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered skin rather than exposed. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, and genitals.\n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days).\n\nThis disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare, but include pneumonia, encephalitis, and secondary bacterial infections.\n\nInfection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immunocompromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles.\n\nThe TCI Ministry of Health strongly advises persons affected with chickenpox to remain at home during their sick leave period to prevent further spread of this illness within the community and schools.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family is the causative agent for chickenpox. Humans are the only reservoir of the virus, and disease occurs only in humans. After primary infection as varicella (chickenpox), the virus remains dormant in the sensory-nerve ganglia and can reactivate at a later time, causing herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nVaricella occurs worldwide. In temperate climates, varicella tends to be a childhood disease, with peak incidence among preschool and school-aged children during late winter and early spring. In these countries, less than 5 percent of adults are susceptible to varicella. In tropical climates, the highest incidence was described in the driest, coolest months; overall, infection tends to be acquired later in childhood, resulting in higher susceptibility among adults than in temperate climates, especially in less densely populated areas.\n\nAll people, including those traveling or living abroad, should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those who do not have evidence of immunity or contraindications to vaccination should receive age-appropriate vaccination. Vaccination against varicella is not a requirement for entry into any country (including the United States), but people who do not have evidence of immunity should be considered at risk for varicella during international travel.\n\nVaricella vaccine contains live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is licensed for people aged 12 months and older, and the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine is licensed only for children 1-12 years. CDC recommends varicella vaccination for all people aged 12 months and older without evidence of immunity to varicella who do not have contraindications to the vaccine: 1 dose for children aged 1-4 years and 2 doses for people aged 4 years and older. The minimum interval between doses is 3 months for children aged less than 13 years and 4 weeks for people aged 13 years and older. Contraindications for vaccination include allergy to vaccine components, immune-compromising conditions or treatments, and pregnancy. When evidence of immunity is uncertain, a possible history of varicella is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness is approximately 80 percent after 1 dose and 95 percent after 2 doses.\n\n(Excerpted and edited from http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/varicella-chickenpox)\n\nMaps of the Turks and Caicos Islands may be accessed at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/tc.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/48358. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nVaricella - USA: (MI) 20160501.4195072\nVaricella - India (02): (PB) 20160415.4158643\nVaricella, MRSA - USA: (MI,PA) school children 20160403.4135512\nVaricella: Caribbean (Grenada), USA (NC) schoolchildren 20160308.4078236\nVaricella-zoster vaccine-associated keratitis: RFI 20160303.4067633\nVaricella - India: (WB) law school students 20160208.40044892015\n----\nChickenpox - Nepal (02): (BN) 20150908.3631748\nChickenpox - Nepal: (KT) post-earthquake 20150505.3343420\n2014\n----\nChickenpox - India (03): (OR) fatal 20141109.2941349\nChickenpox - India (02): (JH) 20140520.2484869\nChickenpox - India: (MP) 20140516.2477950\nChickenpox - Thailand: children 20140210.2268350\n2012\n----\nChickenpox - India (02): (Chennai) 20120415.1102085\nChickenpox- India: (Mumbai) 20120225.1052634\n2011\n----\nChickenpox, children - India (02): (AS) 20110513.1467\nChickenpox, children - India: (AS) 20110511.1453\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["measles", "mumps", "rubella", "varicella", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-05-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "North Caicos", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Providenciales", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Grenada", "country": "Grenada"}, {"location": "Mumbai", "country": "India"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4195072", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Varicella - USA: (MI)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4195072", "date": "2006-12-07 00:00:00", "main_text": "VARICELLA, SCHOOL CHILDREN - USA (NORTH CAROLINA) (02)\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Thu 7 Dec 2006\nFrom: Prof. Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>\nSource: The GIDEON Database, Thu 7 Dec 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.GideonOnline.com>\n\nProMED-mail reminds us that Americans continue to die of Varicella\n[see: ProMED-mail post entitled \"Varicella, school children - USA\n(NC) 20061206.3442].

Whether maternal immunoglobulin has anything\nto do with it is not clear to me given the short time frame and\nthe fact that IgM traditionally does not cross the placenta.\nI would interpret the appearance of the baby's rash at that point as\nbeing indicative of transplacental spread of VZV [varicella-zoster\nvirus] during the initial low level viraemic phase which occurs\nat about three days after initial infection (it is this low level wave\nthat you are trying to block with the neutralising antibody in\nV-ZIG [varicella-zoster immune globulin] when you give it to exposed at risk\nindividuals). Spread at this stage would seem to be a little unusual,\nbut by no means inconceivable. If this is so, then the baby may\nwell have been exposed to VZV for long enough to benefit from whatever\nspecific or non specific responses might have been transferred\ntrans-placentally, but perhaps more importantly, might have also been\nable to mount a response itself.\nThese postulates notwithstanding, I would have a very low threshold\nfor starting this infant on intravenous acyclovir, and would have expect\nV-ZIG to have little if any effect on the clinical course of the\nillness.\nTwo references from a quick search are appended, but the chapter on\nVZV infection in Remington and Klein, \"Infectious Diseases of the\nFetus and Newborn Infant\" is likely to give you all the info you need\nand all the key references.\n89343356\nOutcome in newborn babies given anti-varicella-zoster immunoglobulin after\nperinatal maternal infection with varicella-zoster virus.\nMiller E; Cradock-Watson JE; Ridehalgh MK\nLancet (ENGLAND) Aug 12 1989 2 (8659) p371-3 ISSN: 0140-6736\n281 newborn babies whose mothers had chickenpox and 25 whose mothers had\nherpes zoster during the perinatal period were investigated.
