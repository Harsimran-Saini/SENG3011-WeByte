A detainee 'pod,' which is a prison housing unit consisting of individual cells, was quarantined for weeks after an outbreak in October [2018].\n\nNow 2 pods have been quarantined for 21 days because of the virus, said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an e-mail. Paez did not answer additional questions about why a 2nd outbreak had occurred, or what the facility, which is managed by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was doing to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nBut today, 31 Jan 2019, I [article author Chris Walker] met a detainee at the facility who described what it was like being under quarantine during last fall's outbreak. From behind a glass partition in the center's visitor room, [MA], age 34 years, described how guards one day told his pod, which housed 77 detainees, that they couldn't leave their housing unit, offering no explanation. 'We had no idea what was going on,' [MA] recalls. 'Guards just told us that we had to wait.'\n\nThey wound up waiting for a few days, during which they couldn't access the recreation yard, see visitors, consult face-to-face with lawyers, or even attend their immigration hearings. About a week in, the detainees finally learned that they were under a medical quarantine because of a possible chicken pox outbreak, [MA] says. The potentially sick individuals had been removed from the housing unit before it was locked down. And weeks into the quarantine, a doctor still had not visited the pod. Exasperated, [MA] and about 60 other detainees wrote letters to ICE and the GEO Group demanding answers -- and to see a doctor.\n\nHere's the letter:\n\n'It has been 2 weeks now that we have been in quarantine and not one doctor has been sent to this pod to offer medical treatment for the chicken pox. The first 3 people that were infected have been treated, cured and were switched over to a different pod, and are now living their normal process. But we have no visits, deportations, and our court [hearings] are being delayed.\n\n'They won't exchange our blankets, give haircuts, and we are prohibited from having rec time in the yard. We are being exposed to dangerous medical conditions living like this, causing depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and conditions that could be fatal.\n\n'The most difficult part is the court dates being rescheduled. Many of us have already had chicken pox or been vaccinated. Our immigration process is being delayed because this outbreak wasn't properly handled from the start, and it's not fair. It feels like medical resources don't want to be used on us because we don't deserve it. We are all in desperate need of help.'\n\nA doctor finally visited the pod, dressed in a full-body hazmat suit 'looking like an astronaut,' says [MA].\n\nSome of the information that [MA] provided about the October 2018 outbreak (at least the number of individuals who were quarantined) runs counter to what ICE had told media outlets, including Westword, at the time. 'Of the 77 detainees who were tested, medical staff diagnosed 3 detainees with varicella; 7 others had low immunity and therefore possessed increased risk factors of contracting the disease; all 10 were quarantined at the facility,' spokesman Carl Rusnok said in a statement. 'The Aurora medical staff continues to provide high-level care to all those affected, while at the same time continuing to serve the medical needs of the entire facility population.'\n\nMultiple requests for comment sent to ICE about the 2nd outbreak haven't been returned; if and when they are, we'll update this story.\n\n[Byline: Chris Walker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This situation is unacceptable and entirely preventable. Why were all residents not vaccinated during the outbreak in October 2018? The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. Will they be released from quarantine after this time period? Disease spreads easily when people are housed in overcrowded tight quarters, such as the situation at these detention centers. Many people who cross the border already need treatment for diseases (like chickenpox, tuberculosis), and sanitation is a big problem. These pathogens are highly transmissible. Vaccines need to be administered, and more individual medical attention is needed to prevent exposure of the group to an infectious individual.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security agency that operates detention centers, states on its website that:\n1. Residents will have access to health care education and maintenance services that are determined by the health care authority to be necessary and appropriate.

Lazier wrote that Cal Poly follows these rules. Religious exemptions and exemptions for distance learning students are allowed.\n\nOn 5 Mar 2019, a Cal Poly student was diagnosed with varicella, otherwise known as chickenpox. The varicella vaccine is not one of the required vaccinations, according to Lazier. Only the MMR and hepatitis B vaccines are required.\n\n'Students who do not provide proof of full immunization by the beginning of the 2nd term of the academic year (that is, fall, winter, spring) shall not be allowed to enrol in future classes until proof of full immunization has been provided to the campus,' the Cal Poly Immunization Policy reads.\n\nHow a student may bypass vaccinations past their 2nd term\n---------------------------------------------------------\nIn January of 2016, Governor Jerry Brown passed a bill titled 'SB 277', which banned the 'personal or religious belief' vaccination exemption for schools. Currently, students can be exempt from immunization if forms are submitted by a physician stating that it would be medically unsafe for the individual to be immunized. After Brown's bill passed, the rate of medical exemptions nearly quadrupled, according to a study by the Journal of Pediatrics.\n\nCurrently, the CSU-wide immunization policy is under revision. According to Lazier the revised EO 803 will go into effect in the fall of 2020. Because the EO 803 is not yet revised, all students who either received vaccinations or were exempt while attending California Public School have satisfied the requirement to be admitted into the CSU System. 'Students enrolled in a California Public School for the 7th grade or higher on or after 1 Jul 1999 will have satisfied this requirement,' Chancellor Charles B Reed wrote in the EO 803.\n\nIn an immunization requirement form posted on Cal Poly's website, the form states that 'students who graduated from a California Public high school after January 2005 do not need to complete and submit this form to provide proof of immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B.' However, due to the permissible 'personal belief' exemption that was in place prior to 2016, there is no promise that all public school kids were vaccinated, according to County of San Luis Obispo Public Health Department Health Agency communications coordinator Tara Kennon. 'While the state public health department and local school systems would have recommended that people who attended public school in [California] receive immunizations, personal belief exemptions were allowed until 2016 -- so there was no guarantee that all public school students would be vaccinated,' Kennon wrote.\n\nData collected from the California Department of Public Health concluded that in San Luis Obispo county the overall average percentage of students up to date on their vaccines in the 7th grade public school system was 96.78%. The county-wide private school system's percentages were significantly lower, at 89.8% up to date in the 2017-2018 school year. In order to prevent measles from spreading, 90-94% of people must be vaccinated in order to achieve 'herd immunity.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Varicella vaccination is not one of the required immunizations to enrol at CSU and Cal Poly; only MMR and hepatitis are actually required. And proof of vaccination with MMR and hepatitis vaccines is not required for up to one year following entry at CSU. The Executive Order currently is being revised and will be in place in 2020, but there is no indication varicella will be included. Medical exemptions to the MMR and hepatitis vaccines is allowed, but unfortunately, after passage of the bill disallowing personal and religious exemptions in 2016 in California, medical exemptions quadrupled (See Mohanty S, Buttenheim AM, Joyce CM, et al. Experiences with medical exemptions after a change in vaccine exemption policy in California. Pediatrics. 2018; 142(5): e20181051; http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30373910).

As of Fri 16 Nov 2018, 36 students at Asheville Waldorf School had contracted the varicella virus, known to most as chickenpox. The school has one of the highest vaccination religious exemption rates in the state.\n\n'People don't think it's a serious disease, and for the majority of people it's not. But it's not that way for everybody,' Mullendore said. Two to 3 out of every 1000 children infected with chickenpox required care in a hospital, she said.\n\nEach year, the chickenpox vaccine prevents more than 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states on its webpage. That's why health care providers for years have recommended all children medically able, namely those who have healthy immune systems, be vaccinated, Mullendore said.\n\nThose recommendations have, by and large, gone unheeded by the parents of Asheville Waldorf's 152 students, 110 of whom have not received the chickenpox vaccine, which was made available in the United States in 1995.\n\nNorth Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services tracks the rate of kindergarten attenders whose parents have claimed a religious exemption, allowing them to forego vaccination. During the 2017-2018 school year, the last for which data were available, Asheville Waldorf had a higher rate of religious exemptions for vaccination than all but 2 other schools in the state. Of the 28 kindergarten attenders who enrolled that year, 19 had an exemption to at least one vaccination required by the state for school entry.\n\nSchool officials responded to questions from the Citizen Times on Fri 16 Nov 2018. The school enrols students from nursery age through 6th grade, Mullendore said.\n\nThe only 2 North Carolina schools to top Asheville Waldorf's religious exemption rate were private schools in other counties. Both had 100 per cent exemption rates; one had only one kindergarten student, the other had 2. During the same academic year, Buncombe County led the state in religious exemption rates for kindergartners with 5.7 per cent.\n\n'The thing people need to understand is that when you have pockets of unvaccinated people, they serve as reservoirs for disease,' said Susan Sullivan, a nurse with the state DHHS who consults with local health departments about vaccines and preventable diseases.\n\nBuncombe County has long dealt with high vaccination exemption rates, in part from parents who fear vaccines more than the illnesses they prevent.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[See: ProMED-mail.

In an interview on Wednesday [20 Mar 2019], Dr. Patricia Grace Trabado, PHO head, said the cases were observed as patients who sought treatment at the rural health units (RHU) and private clinics in Tubungan.\n\nAll the cases were recorded in Cadabdab Elementary School, with 21 male and 15 female students affected. Trabado said affected pupils might still be attending school even though they were infected, which resulted in its transmission.\n\nShe emphasized that the spread of the infection might have been prevented if the children were advised not to attend school with the onset of infection. 'If a child is showing chickenpox symptoms, especially when he or she was previously exposed to an affected person, then the pupil will be advised to stay at home,' she said.\n\nTrabado said the source of the infection came from the 1st patient working in Iloilo City but lives in Tubungan town. 'The patient might have a family member that attends school in Cadabdab. From there, we see where the infection originated,' she said. Trabado, however, did not give figures of the disease other than that from the school.\n\nThe RHUs and private clinics were able to monitor and manage the cases, Trabado said. All the student patients were discharged, given medication, and let the viral infection take its course. 'And eventually, the patients recovered,' she said. However, Trabado warns that a child with chickenpox can get secondary infection when he or she scratches the blisters, creating skin lesions.\n\nShe added that cases of chickenpox and mumps are mostly observed during the summer season. Trabado said patients with chickenpox experience fever and headache in the first 1 or 2 days before the itchy blister rash appears.\n\n[Byline: Gail Momblan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nPhilippines: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/158]\n\n******\n[2] New Mexico\nDate: Fri 22 Mar 2019\nSource: CBS 4 Local [edited]\nhttps://cbs4local.com/news/local/some-prisoners-quarantined-in-otero-county-prison-to-stop-spread-of-chickenpox\n\n\nHealth officials at a prison in southern New Mexico are working to stop the spread of chickenpox.

Later, a rash on her skin made her feel like small needles were stabbing her.\n\n[She] works for CTV News and she has experienced the pain caused by shingles. She said that she couldn't walk for a few days from the nerve pain: 'It was in my back and then traveled down my leg as well, so sitting all day was extremely uncomfortable and I had some trouble sleeping at night.'\n\nWhen she went to visit her doctor, he said that she had shingles. But the disease is less common in young people, and [she] is 36 years old.\n\nEach year in Canada, there are 130 000 people that develop the disease. The Canadian researchers and the US CDC have noticed that in the last few years, the numbers have increased, but they don't know why.\n\nPeople that had chickenpox [are at risk of developing shingles], because the varicella-zoster virus that caused chickenpox can remain dormant in the body, even if chickenpox cleared. The virus remains until the immunity system wears it off. In some cases, the virus reactivates as shingles, which is a painful rash that looks like a stripe on the body, usually on the trunk. It's a mystery why the virus reactivates only in some people, but the risks increase with age.\n\nSome young people can develop shingles because their immune system is weak or they are under high levels of stress.\n\nIt's important to check a medic, says Dr Lynora Saxinger, infectious diseases expert at the University of Alberta Hospital: 'If you start treatment for it, you can reduce the severity and reduce the risk of going on to a pain syndrome that can sometimes be prolonged. You can actually improve your chances of healing well by getting therapy early.'\n\nThere are 10-15 percent of people with shingles that develop severe pain where the rash occurs, with a pain that can go for weeks and months. To shorten the illness and to prevent the pains in the postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), Dr Saxinger said that patients receive antiviral medications.\n\nHowever, shingles could be triggered by other diseases:\n\n'Shingles in a younger person could be a sign of another underlying health condition. So if you get shingles, it might be worth having a check-up to make sure you don't have another health condition that hasn't been recognized.'\n\n[Byline: Rex Austin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Infection with the varicella-zoster virus leads to chickenpox, or primary varicella. The virus then lies dormant and can later reactivate as shingles, or herpes zoster. it presents as a painful rash that usually develops on one side of the body, often the face or torso. The rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7-10 days and clears up within 2-4 weeks. Some people describe the pain as an intense burning sensation. For some people, the pain can last for months or even years after the rash goes away. This long-lasting pain is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and it is the most common complication of shingles. Your risk of getting shingles and PHN increases as you get older.\n\nA new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get 2 doses of Shingrix, 2-6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN. Shingrix is the preferred vaccine, over Zostavax\u00ae, a shingles vaccine in use since 2006.\n\nTwo doses of Shingrix provide strong protection against shingles and postherpetic neuralgia.\n- In adults 50-69 years old who got 2 doses, Shingrix was 97 percent effective in preventing shingles; among adults 70 years and older, Shingrix was 91 percent effective.\n- In adults 50-69 years old who got 2 doses, Shingrix was 91 percent effective in preventing PHN; among adults 70 years and older, Shingrix was 89 percent effective.\nShingrix protection remained high (more than 85 percent) in people 70 years and older throughout the 4 years following vaccination. Since your risk of shingles and PHN increases as you get older, it is important to have strong protection against shingles in your older years.\n(excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination.html)\n\nZostavax [the former vaccine that has been around since 2006] only lowers the odds of getting shingles by 51 percent, and of PHN by 67 percent. It's even less effective in people ages 70 and older. The Zostavax vaccine contains a live but weakened version of varicella zoster -- the virus that causes shingles and chickenpox.\n\nShingrix [the new vaccine] is a killed version of the zoster virus. It also contains an adjuvant. 'It causes your immune system to produce more antibodies to fight shingles than Zostavax produced. So your body has a stronger immune response to the Shingrix vaccine than to the Zostavax vaccine,' says Michael Hogue, PharmD, a professor of pharmacy at the Samford University College of Health Sciences.\n\n[As a result,] Shingrix causes more side effects than Zostavax. The main side effects reported in studies were soreness, redness, and swelling where you get the shot. Some people also got headaches or felt tired or achy after the shot. About 1 out of 10 people said the side effects were severe enough to disrupt their daily life. Yet most felt better within 3 to 5 days.\n\n'The side effects of the Shingrix are temporary and usually last 2 to 3 days. While you may experience pain for a few days after getting Shingrix, the pain will be less severe than having shingles and the complications from the disease,' the CDC says.\n(excerpted from https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/shingles/news/20180212/new-shingles-vaccine_what-you-need-to-know). - Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nCanada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12]", "summary": "In adults 50-69 years old who got 2 doses, Shingrix was 97 percent effective in preventing shingles; among adults 70 years and older, Shingrix was 91 percent effective.

It's very contagious, and it's very easily spread from one person to the next,' said Dr. Michael Wasserman.\n\nDr. Wasserman is a pediatrician at Oschner for Children and he is not seeing it in his practice. The state Health Department isn't seeing other places with clusters either, but a letter to the parents from the preschool confirms 5 cases. Some parents believe there are now 8. Pediatricians recommend children get the chicken pox vaccine at 1 year and at 4 years of age. In the 1st year of life, they have some immunity passed on from mothers.\n\nBut on [Wed 28 Mar 2018], the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals sent a letter to the parents, recommending exposed children, at least 6 months of age and older, get the vaccine. Dr. Wasserman agrees with the state recommendation.\n\n'Would you rather get it (chicken pox) from the immunization, which is controlled, or would you rather get something that is wild and uncontrolled, and could make you much sicker with complications?'\n\nDr. Wasserman is concerned that children with 30--100 lesions will be at risk for getting staph infection in them, the kind that is resistant to antibiotics. Both he and state doctors recommend children get on the prescription antiviral acyclovir the 1st day the rash breaks out and keep the rash extra clean.\n\n'Chicken pox has a lot of misery associated with it, and so the treatments include, medication for itch such as Benadryl, or one of the other oral antihistamines, Zyrtec or Claritin. You can put Calamine lotion. You can use Aveeno oatmeal baths, and you clean the heck out of the kids,' said Dr. Wasserman.\n\nThe preschool says a child may have been misdiagnosed with a different infection (impetigo) before coming in. Also doctors remind adults that if they have the shingles, that can be passed on as chicken pox to people who have not been vaccinated or who have never had a case.\n\n[Byline: Meg Farris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chickenpox used to be very common in the United States.

Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. The rash appears first on the stomach, back, and face and can spread over the entire body causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk, for example.\n\nThe best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. Children, adolescents, and adults should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing the disease. Most people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, it is usually mild -- with fewer red spots or blisters and mild or no fever.

Furthermore, the clinical presentation of herpes zoster in children is distinct, and vaccination may further modify disease presentation. The investigators noted small pink to erythematous papules or pseudovesicles, rather than true vesicles, with varying degrees of overlying hemorrhagic crust and peripheral erythema. Fever and pain are rarely prominent features, and postherpetic neuralgia is exceedingly rare in childhood cases.\n\nSee publication cited above for references and photographs of rash in these cases.\n\nThe Varicella-zoster virus also causes shingles. Chickenpox can be spread from people with shingles to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. This can happen if a person touches or breathes in virus from shingles blisters. In these cases, a person might develop chickenpox, not shingles. Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another.

While no major outbreaks have been reported, the College of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET) was closed for 2 weeks on [Mon 19 Feb 2018], after 19 cases of chicken pox were reported amongst students, mostly hostel mates.\n\nAbout 13 students had been diagnosed clinically, while the rest had reported with fever and rashes, the beginning stage of the infection. The 1st case had been reported on [29 Jan 2018] and the next case on [14 Feb 2018]. Chicken pox being a highly contagious, air-borne disease, it was natural for the infection to spread in hostels, which are often congested and where students are in close contact with each other.\n\nPatients are contagious up to 5 days before and 5 days after the first rash appears. The incubation period (the time from infection to symptoms) is about 14 to 21 days after contact with the virus. Hence it is likely that there will be more cases, the District Medical Officer, P. Preetha, said.\n\nIt was just 2 weeks ago that the Sree Chitra Tirunal College of Engineering at Pappanamcode had been closed for a fortnight following a cluster of chicken pox cases. About 25-30 cases had been reported.\n\nDr. Preetha said that as summer intensifies it was usual for a number of cases to be reported every year.\n\nIn unimmunised populations, most people contract chickenpox by age 15, but all ages can contract it. Unlike before, most of the youngsters today have not been exposed to the virus as children. Chicken pox infection thus shows up more severely in adults and hence preventive vaccination is advised.\n\nHealthy persons who have not been vaccinated or not had the disease before, but who come into contact with an infected person, can lessen the severity of the infection if they get vaccinated within the first 3 to 5 days after the exposure.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk.\n\nA total of 2 doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox. When you get vaccinated, you protect yourself and others in your community. This is especially important for people who cannot get vaccinated, such as those with weakened immune systems or pregnant women.\n\nSome people who are vaccinated against chickenpox may still get the disease.

Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide. Bulletin of the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/ doi: 10.2471/BLT.07.040089). This bulletin provides an excellent summary of the benefits of vaccines. While elimination of smallpox may be the best example of a successful vaccine, data for efficacy of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are given below. These vaccine-preventable diseases still occur, largely because of vaccine hesitancy, but disease severity and mortality are greatly reduced.\n\nBefore the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; and of these, 400-500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99 percent reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html).\n\nBefore the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html).\n\nBefore the rubella vaccination program started in 1969, rubella was a common and widespread infection in the United States. During the last major rubella epidemic in the United States from 1964-1965, an estimated 12.5 million people got rubella, 11 000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2100 newborns died, and 20 000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Once the vaccine became widely used, the number of people infected with rubella in the United States dropped dramatically. Today, [fewer] than 10 people in the United States are reported as having rubella each year. Since 2012, all rubella cases had evidence that they were infected when they were living or traveling outside the United States (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/in-the-us.html).\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nNew York, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/31193\nNew York county map: http://geology.com/county-map/new-york-county-map.gif]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nBefore the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting.

The illness was not confirmed through laboratory analysis, but was diagnosed by the unnamed student's medical doctor. The letter, from district Superintendent Terry Ward and Cayuga County Health Department Public Health Director Kathleen Cuddy, said the student has had the chickenpox vaccine.\n\nIn a telephone interview Wed [31 Jan 2018], Ward said he heard about the case from Kathy Nodine, the high school's nurse, on the afternoon of 25 Jan. He praised Nodine, saying she suggested contacting the health department that same day. Ward said the student can return once they don't have chickenpox anymore and their chickenpox blisters have dried and crusted; as they can no longer spread the disease.\n\nCuddy said Nodine contacted people in the school community she was aware of who could experience severe effects from the disease if they were to contract it -- such as those who are pregnant or have immunodeficiency. Cuddy said she isn't aware of other probable chickenpox cases in the county. She doesn't recall hearing about another case during her 17 years as a department employee.\n\nWard used the district's new emergency phone system on Fri to send a pre-recorded message telling parents about the case. There have been no new cases reported, he said. Over the past couple weeks, Ward said, the district has been 'vigilant' during flu season, wiping down surfaces such as desktops, door knobs, keyboards and drinking fountains.\n\nWard thanked the health department for its cooperation. Cuddy praised the cooperation among the department, the district, Nodine, the student's health care provider and family. 'Everybody was on board with doing all of the ideal actions,' Cuddy said.\n\nAccording to the district's letter, chickenpox can be transmitted through people touching the saliva, blisters and mucus of an infected person and through the air by sneezing and coughing. Touching a newly contaminated item, such as clothing, can spread it as well. Touching the blisters of someone with shingles can also cause chickenpox in someone who has not been vaccinated and has never had the disease.\n\nSomeone with chickenpox can spread it 1 -- 2 days before getting the rash, until all of the person's blisters scab over, typically from 5 -- 7 days. It normally takes a person up to three weeks to develop chickenpox after being exposed to someone with it.\n\nInitial symptoms can include a sudden slight fever and feeling weak, with an itchy blaster-like rah following afterward. Chickenpox blisters are more commonly found on body parts typically covered as opposed to exposed parts.\n\nIt is recommended that those who have never been vaccinated for chickenpox or were vaccinated once, consult their health care provider about additional appropriate vaccination.\n\n[Byline: Kelly Rocheleau kelly.rocheleau@lee.net]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from Healthmap alerts\npromed@promedmail.org\n\n\n\n\n\n[Doctors generally diagnose chickenpox based on its characteristic rash.

'We wanted to let people know so they can take extra precautions, especially if they are at higher risk,' he said. Pletcher and the email noted that high-risk persons include pregnant women, immunocompromised persons, and those infected with HIV/AIDS.\n\nAccording to the email, chickenpox, known for 'an itchy, blister-like rash all over the body' it implies, is spread by physical contact with the virus, breathing in blister particles, or absorbing tiny saliva droplets from infected persons. Individuals who have been vaccinated against chickenpox can still get the disease, although these individuals' symptoms are normally milder than symptoms in non-vaccinated patients. Symptoms of chickenpox include those consistent with a fever or cold, which then develops into the virus's infamous rash. As the virus takes 10--21 days to display symptoms, it can be spread by an unknowingly infected individual 1-2 days before the rash initially occurs.\n\n[...]\n\nPrinceton community members can take steps to reduce their risk of contracting either virus.

Blisters could be filled with water in some cases.\n\nThe incubation period of the disease is 14-21 days. In males above 13 years, complications can result in inflammation of the testes that may lead to sterility. The patient must be kept in complete isolation until blisters dry up. If diagnosed early, the disease can be controlled to a large extent. Those who get chickenpox develop immunity against the virus.\n\nVaricella zoster virus enters through the respiratory system, targeting the skin and peripheral nerves. The period of illness is from 3-4 days. One to 2 days before the rashes appear, is when this virus is the most contagious. Some signs and symptoms are vesicles that fill with pus, rupture, and scab before healing. Lesions tend to stay towards the face, throat, and lower back sometimes on the chest and shoulders.\n\nIn about 10-20 percent of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, producing a disease known as shingles or herpes zoster.

A medical team from the district government hospital rushed to the villages to treat the patients.\n\nChickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through coughs and sneezes of an infected person and is also highly contagious for those who are not immune to it, for which isolation of the patient is a primary step to check the spread. Chickenpox has an incubation period of 2-3 weeks. While there is no medication to speed up the healing process of chickenpox, the itching and sores can be soothed with over-the-counter calamine lotion, said Kendrapara chief district medical officer (CDMO) Baishnaba Charan Sahoo.

Poor villagers have no money to purchase medicines from the shops, and as a result, they are left to suffer.\n\nBut the CDMO refuted the allegation of the villagers. 'We have distributed medicines freely to the patients,' Dr Sahoo said.

In both these major hospitals, 25 to 30 children are brought daily to the OPD. It is believed that the viral diseases have turned into an epidemic due to a lack of proper EPI [Expanded Program on Immunization] vaccination.\n\nThese diseases infect children aged between 1 to 6 years.

He added that cases of pneumonia have also increased.\n\nTo a question, Prof Jamro affirmed that the only preventive measure is proper vaccination for these infectious viral diseases.

Patients develop a blister-like rash or boil, which 1st appears on the face and trunk, and then spreads throughout the body, including inside the mouth, eyelids and in the genital area.\n\nThe virus is airborne and can be spread mainly through tiny droplets from infected persons when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze. Symptoms include the presence of a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters that eventually turn into scabs, mild to moderate fever, tiredness, loss of appetite and headaches.\n\nThough not common, chickenpox can also lead to serious issues, such as skin infections, dehydration, pneumonia and swelling of the brain.\n\nAccording to a Public Health Ministry statement, chickenpox has an incubation period of between 10 and 21 days, meaning the rash will appear from 10 to 21 days after the virus has infected the patient. However, it said an infected person is contagious about 2 days before the rash appears, and then continues being contagious for another 4 to 5 days until all the blisters have formed scabs.\n\nTreatment of the virus, the ministry noted, includes the use of non-aspirin medications, such as acetaminophen, to relieve fever from chickenpox, calamine lotion, which may help prevent itching and irritation of the skin, as well as the administering of antiviral medications in specific cases.\n\nHowever, the chickenpox vaccine is considered the best way to prevent the contraction of chickenpox. Children, adolescents, and adults, it is recommended, should get 2 doses of the vaccine, which is considered very safe and effective at preventing the disease.\n\nMost people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, it is usually mild -- with fewer red spots or boils and mild or no fever. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe disease.\n\nIn cases where vaccination is not possible, the ministry said preventative measures must be taken from coming into contact with droplets of saliva and the blisters of an infected person.\n\nThis includes hand washing, protection when sneezing and coughing, and not sharing utensils.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In April 2016, the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) began a cross country campaign in Guyana and elsewhere targeting defaulters and hard to reach populations as part of World Vaccine week, with a special focus on remote regions in the hinterland and the engagement of schools.

While chicken pox is a seasonal visitor that keeps returning every February-March, this time, it has struck scores of Kolkatans -- including children -- a 2nd time, which is unusual. Experts say it could either be altered antigens that are making vaccines ineffective or a poor maintenance of the cold chain of vaccines that has been negating their preventive powers.\n\nAround 20% of children below 8 years now suffer a 2nd attack of chicken pox, according to an estimate by medical practitioners. Even though less than 5% of adults suffer a repeat attack, the number was still worryingly high, they felt.\n\n'The number of those suffering a 2nd bout of chicken pox was very high compared to previous years. When it strikes a 2nd time, the symptoms turn out to be less severe, but it still leaves you weak,' said Samarjit Naskar, consultant, Belle Vue Clinic.\n\nTwelve-year-old Ayush Sen had an attack a week before his final exam 3 weeks ago.

A live attenuated vaccine was introduced in 1995. Prior to that, in the early 1990s, an average of 4 million people got chickenpox, 10 500-13 000 were hospitalized (range, 8000 to 18 000), and 100 to 150 died each year. The chickenpox vaccine carries less risk of severe disease than does getting the disease, and most people who get the vaccine do not have any problems with it.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends one or 2 doses, with the initial dose given at 12-18 months of age. The 2nd dose if given should occur at least 1-3 months later. In the United States, 2 doses are recommended starting at 12-15 months of age.\n\nHowever, chickenpox after vaccination has been noted in 2 different situations. The more common of the 2 is a breakthrough infection, which is believed to be caused by a wild-type varicella virus. Eight to 9 out of every 10 people who are vaccinated [with chickenpox vaccine] are completely protected from chickenpox. The vaccine almost always prevents against severe disease. Breakthrough infection is usually very mild, with fewer skin lesions (usually less than 50) lasting only a few days, with no fever or a low fever, and few other chickenpox symptoms. Breakthrough infection is estimated to occur in approximately 2 percent of vaccinations per year. The rate does not appear to increase with length of time since vaccination.\n\nThe 2nd situation, in which you catch chickenpox from the chickenpox vaccine itself, is extremely rare. It has only been documented in healthy people on 3 occasions out of the 21 million doses of vaccine distributed.

Hearing loss appears to be linked to Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) caused by vaccination\n------------------------------------\nSudden Hearing Loss in an Adolescent Patient. When is it an emergency? By J Gurley, C Hill, S Haley, and C Bailey.\n\nHearing loss is common in all ages and has 3 main categories: conductive, sensorineural and mixed. The leading causes of conductive hearing loss are cerumen impaction, otitis media and otosclerosis. The main causes of sensorineural hearing loss include inherited disorders, noise exposure and presbycusis. (1) This adolescent case study focuses on diagnosis of a potentially complex hearing loss etiology.\n\nClinical Presentation\n----------------------\nMary is a 17-year-old, white adolescent teen who developed sudden hearing loss in the right ear, along with a burning sensation and a vesicular rash behind the same right ear.\n\nShe reported acute hearing loss 2 days subsequent to the rash. Mary denies any trauma to head or ear.\n\nPast Medical History\n----------------\nMary has not had the chickenpox because she had 2 doses of the Varicella vaccine. The weakened Varicella vaccine can reactivate in rare instances to cause herpes zoster (HZ). (2) It is also assumed that a decline in cell-mediated immunity may play a critical role in the reactivation of the weakened Varicella vaccine. (3)\n\nMary denies HIV, asplenia and medication use at this time. Therefore, she has no history of past or present immunosuppression. There is no family history of inherited sensorineural hearing loss or gradual hearing loss over time. Mary denies the use of headphones and has never attended a concert. Mary does admit to listening to music in her car loudly.\n\nMary denies use of alcohol or illicit drugs and has no known drug allergies. Mary is up to date with all state required immunizations. She and her mother presented to ambulatory acute care awake, alert and oriented to person, place, and time.\n\nMary's vital signs were blood pressure, 98/62; heart rate, 86 beats per minute and regular; afebrile; respiratory rate of 16 saturating at 98% on room air, and weight, 120 lbs. A complete blood count and blood chemistry were done to rule out any immunocompromised state. A Varicella titer was also performed to confirm whether there were any Varicella antibodies indicating immunity to varicella.\n\nA Physical Examination\n--------------\nObjective findings included a 3cm by 2cm unilateral, red, and raised vesicular rash behind her right ear. Surrounding skin was red and inflamed. Some vesicles were oozing yellow serous fluid from Mary scratching the area.\n\nOtoscopic evaluation revealed redness and vesicles inside the right ear canal. There was scant cerumen in both ears. Mary's tympanic membrane was pearly grey with boney landmarks visible. There was no abnormal bone growth seen in the middle ear. A tuning fork was used to perform the Weber hearing test. Mary was able to feel the vibrations in her left ear, which suggested the possibility of sensorineural hearing lost.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nSudden Sensoneural Hearing Loss (SSNHL) Secondary to HZ, also known as shingles, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). (2)\n\nHZ is an illness triggered by the reactivation of VZV, which lies dormant in sensory ganglia after primary infection. (3) Clinically, HZ is usually evidenced by unilateral radicular pain and vesicular eruptions limited to a single dermatome innervated by a single spinal or cranial sensory ganglion. (4)\n\nThe incidence and severity of HZ disease increases with age, with a noticeable rise after 50 years of age, however, although relatively rare, HZ also occurs in children. (5) Sadly, there is not enough data at this point to assess whether the varicella vaccine, which became available in 1995, is consistently associated with milder cases of chicken pox and fewer occurrences of shingles later in life. (6)\n\nStudies have shown that one dose of the varicella vaccine has been effective at preventing 85% of varicella cases. (6) It is estimated that one million people annually are affected with HZ. (3) HZ-associated pain tends to resolve over time, but some patients suffer from post neuropathic pain beyond resolution of visible cutaneous manifestations. (2)\n\nMaking a Referral\n--------------\nThe decision to refer Mary to the next level of care was made when vesicles were found inside the ear canal along with hearing loss. The referral was made to try to keep Mary's hearing intact. Mary was referred to urgent care because SSNHL is one of the few emergencies in otology. (5) This emergency is also a terrifying experience for patients as they lose the ability to effectively communicate. (5)\n\nSudden sensorineural hearing loss is a rather common otologic disorder characterized by newly onset unilateral or bilateral hearing loss that develops rapidly, within 72 hours. (5)\n\nViral infections such as HZ can lead to SSNHL. (5) Studies showing the connection between HZ and SSHNL are lacking at this time. (5) Therefore, no definitive numbers can be assigned for the incidence in adolescents.\n\nFollow-up\n--------\nDuring a follow up call the next day, it was learned that Mary was diagnosed with herpes zoster. She was diagnosed by clinical presentation alone. A Varicella titer was performed to prove the antibodies of the vaccination were present, which they weren't due to varicella vaccination.\n\nMary was placed on Valtrex 1000mg by mouth 3 times a day for 7 days, Tylenol #3 30mg/300mg every 8 hours as needed for pain, and prednisone dose pack starting at 60mg and tapering off over 2 weeks. It is recommended for HZ to be treated with antiviral agents, pain medication and corticosteroids for pain control.

It is key to remember that prompt treatment of disease can deter hearing loss. (1) Recovery is variable, and patients with more severe losses display poorer recovery of hearing since the hearing loss is due to degeneration in the cochlear nerve, as well as inflammation around the brain lining. (1) Therefore, it is important to remember to educate patients on importance of up-to-date immunizations and early treatment of diseases, which can also lower the chances of hearing loss.

A child who gets chickenpox may be at higher risk for an ear infection, and hearing loss, but it rarely happens.\n\nIn adults older than 60, the chickenpox virus can reactivate itself in a condition known as shingles (herpes zoster). One symptom of shingles is hearing loss. If an adult has not been vaccinated for shingles, the virus can also reactivate in a rare disease called Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\n\nRamsay Hunt affects the nerve near the inner ear and causes a painful rash. This painful rash can happen on the eardrum, ear canal, or the earlobe. The syndrome produces weakness of the face on one side of the face.\n\nIn addition, generally, temporary hearing loss can happen in one ear.

The link among the cases appeared to be the school bus that all 4 children rode to and from school each day, according to the report. The kids didn't interact socially in school or have classes or lunch together, the researchers noted.\n\nChickenpox outbreaks are rare, because most children are now vaccinated against the virus. At the school in the report, 95 percent of the students were fully vaccinated, meaning they had received both doses of the vaccine, as recommended, the researchers said. Another 3 percent of students at the school had received one shot, the researchers noted.\n\nNo other cases of chickenpox were diagnosed in the school for the rest of the year, according to the report.\n\nThe health officials investigating the outbreak revealed that the 1st child to get sick had not been vaccinated, and that the child's 4 siblings (also unvaccinated) had all also recently been kept home from school because of a rash that looked like chickenpox.\n\nAmong the 3 children who likely caught the virus on the school bus, one had been fully vaccinated, according to the report. Full vaccination is between 88 and 98 percent effective at preventing chickenpox, according to the CDC.\n\nThe other 2 children, who were siblings, had not been vaccinated, the investigators wrote. Those children later spread chickenpox to their 17-month-old sibling, according to the report.\n\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The same virus also causes shingles in adults. In this case, a shingles infection turned out to be the source of the chickenpox infection: The 1st child's parent had a shingles infection several weeks before the children developed chickenpox, according to the report.\n\nBefore the chickenpox vaccine was developed, the virus spread easily from kid to kid, especially in schools. However, now that most kids are vaccinated against the virus, it may be increasingly likely that kids, particularly those who are unvaccinated, will get the virus from adults who have shingles, rather than from other kids, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers mentioned only one previous report, which occurred in China, of chickenpox spreading on a school bus. Because school buses put kids in close proximity to each other, however, doctors and public health officials investigating similar outbreaks might want to consider these vehicles as a possible risk factor, the report said.\n\n[Byline: Sara G. Miller]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chickenpox is most contagious from 2 to 3 days before the rash appears until all the blisters have crusted over. So in those early infectious days, the disease is not evident and transmission readily occurs. About 14 to 16 days after contact with a person infected with the virus, the 1st symptoms of chickenpox usually develop. Most people feel sick and have a fever, a decreased appetite, a headache, a cough, and a sore throat. Some children get the chickenpox rash without 1st having the early symptoms.\n\nThe chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster) can spread easily from one person to another. It most often spreads through the respiratory tract, such as mucous membranes of the mouth and nose. You also can get chickenpox through the air from an infected person's sneezing or coughing. Less often, chickenpox is spread when fluid from a chickenpox blister gets on your skin. In rare cases, a person can get chickenpox from the fluid of shingles blisters [which appears to be the origin of the first case described above].\n\nThe chickenpox vaccine is more than 95 percent effective in preventing a severe chickenpox infection. However, 10 to 30 percent of children who have received the vaccine will develop mild chickenpox symptoms after exposure to a person with chickenpox.\n\nA map of the United States showing the location of Michigan can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3087.]", "summary": "In this case, a shingles infection turned out to be the source of the chickenpox infection: The 1st child's parent had a shingles infection several weeks before the children developed chickenpox, according to the report. \n\nHealth officials in rural Muskegon County, Michigan, were alerted to a suspected case of the chickenpox in an 8-year-old last December [2015] after the child was sent home from school, according to the report of the outbreak from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published today (8 Sep 2016).

VZV only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults and rarely in children. VZV also is known as chickenpox virus, varicella virus, zoster virus, and human herpesvirus type 3 (HHV-3).\n\nKathmandu climate is classified as subtropical wet forest biome. In temperate and most tropical climates, varicella has a distinct seasonal fluctuation, with the highest incidence occurring in winter and early spring. However, a study conducted in Australia, a temperate region, found that in contrast to published data from temperate zones elsewhere, varicella infection in Victoria and South Australia had a peak incidence in summer months with a smaller peak in early winter. While the geographical differences in varicella epidemiology remain to be investigated, it is possible that geographic segregation of VZV genotypes may account for some of the differences seen.

Symptoms of chickenpox include a skin rash of blister-like lesions covering the body but usually more concentrated on the face, scalp, and trunk.\n\nThe risk of complications increases after puberty and includes bacterial infection of skin lesions, dehydration, and pneumonia.\n\nMost, but not all, individuals with chickenpox have fever, which develops just before or when the rash appears. If exposed, people who have been vaccinated against the disease may get a milder illness, with less severe rash and mild or no fever. The illness lasts about 5 to 10 days.\n\nShingles is a painful rash that can develop in people who previously had chickenpox.

On the other hand, experts believe it may bestow a positive health benefit later in life, in the form of a lowered risk of developing glioma.\n\nAn international collaboration led by researchers in the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine has reported there is an inverse relationship between a history of chickenpox and glioma, a type of brain cancer. In other words, children who have had the chickenpox may be less likely to develop brain cancer.\n\nBut this doesn't mean parents should drop everything and start organizing chickenpox parties.\n\nSince chickenpox in adults is usually more severe than it is in children, some parents deliberately expose their children to the virus, sometimes by taking them to 'chickenpox parties.' Doctors counter that children are safer getting the vaccine, which is a weakened form of the virus, than getting the disease, which can be fatal.\n\nThe current study, led by Dr. Melissa Bondy, a McNair Scholar and associate director for cancer prevention and population sciences at Baylor, and Dr. E. Susan Amirian, assistant professor in the Duncan Cancer Center at Baylor, was one of the largest studies to date.\n\nThe study involved reviewing information from the Glioma International Case-Control Study, a large, multi-site consortium with data on 4533 cases and 4171 controls collected across 5 countries. The researchers found a 21 percent reduced risk of developing glioma with a positive history of chickenpox.\n\nFurthermore, they identified the protective effective was greater in higher grade gliomas. The large study validates earlier studies showing this link, Bondy said.\n\n'It provides more of an indication that there is some protective benefit from having the chickenpox,' she said. 'The link is unlikely to be coincidental.'\n\nIn the future, scientists may be able to apply the chickenpox vaccine to brain cancer research.

Like other herpesviruses, VZV has the capacity to persist in the body after the primary (1st) infection as a latent infection. VZV persists in sensory nerve ganglia. Primary infection with VZV results in chickenpox. Herpes zoster (shingles) is the result of reactivation of latent VZV infection. An increasingly large body of evidence is building supporting an inverse relationship between VZV and glioma.\n\nThe conclusions to the paper above state:\n\n'Findings from the previous literature, bolstered by those of our study, provide strong epidemiologic rationale for continued investigation of the potential role of chickenpox (or other manifestations of VZV infection) in glioma development. Future studies will need to account for the potential impact of the VZV vaccine, which was licensed in 1995 in the U.S. for use among children (and therefore cannot be evaluated in the older population of the GICC). Prior serologic analyses have demonstrated that antibody composition differs between children who experience a wild-type VZV infection versus those who were received the vaccine. Some evidence indicates that antibodies against specific VZV-encoded proteins (i.e., VZV ORF2 and IE63) may be more important than others in conferring protection against glioma, but the vaccine does not contain antigens corresponding to all 70 VZV open reading frames. Thus, future research ascertaining whether the vaccine confers similar protection against glioma as the wild-type VZV infection is of high importance and may lend insight into the biological mechanisms at play.'\n\nThis study and an earlier review of the literature -- posted below -- provide very enticing support for the inverse relationship between glioma and varicella infection.\n\nA review of the relationship between varicella and glioma was previously published in 2014:\nPundole X, Amirian ES, Scheurer ME.

Future studies should focus on assessing how age at primary VZV infection is relevant to anti-VZV antibody response and, in turn, glioma risk. In addition to anti-VZV IgG levels, a more comprehensive panel of biomarkers of VZV infection and immunity, such as viral DNA, measures of viral expression (protein and RNA transcripts), and markers of cell-mediated immunity, should be identified and incorporated into future studies. Furthermore, because most studies of glioma and VZV are case-control studies, more prospective studies are necessary to untangle the temporal relationships between infection and tumorogenesis. As glioma is a rare disease, this may only be feasible in Northern European countries with centralized medical databases. Finally, as the literature comes to a consensus on the role of VZV infection in glioma risk, interactions between atopy and VZV immunity should also be examined. Stratification of VZV-glioma analyses by IgE levels or childhood history of atopic conditions may provide useful information on how these factors are inter-related.\n\n'Another factor that will need to be accounted for in future studies is whether anti-VZV IgG positive participants were immunized against VZV or if they had an actual VZV infection. Antibody composition differs between individuals who experienced a wild-type VZV infection compared to those who were exposed to the live attenuated vaccine. It is, therefore, important to investigate the association between VZV immunity and glioma, distinguishing between infected and vaccinated individuals. If differences are noted between these groups, this knowledge may point toward specific viral antigenic targets that may be of greater relevance to gliomagenesis, perhaps because they resemble an antigen present on tumour cells.\n\n'The literature is slowly approaching a consensus on the inverse association between VZV infection and immunity and glioma risk. However, several gaps in knowledge, outlined above, still need to be filled before definitive conclusions can be drawn about this potentially complex relationship.' - Mod.LK]", "summary": "The conclusions to the paper above state:\n\n'Findings from the previous literature, bolstered by those of our study, provide strong epidemiologic rationale for continued investigation of the potential role of chickenpox (or other manifestations of VZV infection) in glioma development.

'It is important to know that, despite common misconceptions, illness from chickenpox can be severe and sometimes require hospitalization resulting in serious complications.'\n\nIt is true, though, that chickenpox is generally less serious in children than in adolescents or adults. Adolescents, adults and people with weakened immune systems also have a higher risk for complications.\n\nA vaccine for chickenpox was licensed in 1995 and has since been recommended for kids. Since then, there has been about a 97 percent decline in the number of cases in Michigan, the health department said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone born after 1980 who hasn't had chickenpox should get vaccinated. The vaccination in children has been shown to be between 89 and 98 percent effective in preventing mild to moderate chickenpox disease and 100 percent effective in preventing severe chickenpox.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One wonders if increased numbers of parents are not having their children vaccinated against varicella (VZV; chickenpox) or whether the increase in cases is due to breakthrough following vaccination.\n\nIn individuals who have not been vaccinated with varicella vaccine, the rash is generalized and pruritic and progresses rapidly from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before crusting. The rash usually appears first on the head, then on the trunk, and then the extremities; the highest concentration of lesions is on the trunk. Lesions also can occur on mucous membranes of the oropharynx, respiratory tract, vagina, conjunctiva, and the cornea. Lesions are usually 1 to 4 mm in diameter. The vesicles are superficial and delicate and contain clear fluid on an erythematous base. Vesicles may rupture or become purulent before they dry and crust. Successive crops appear over several days, with lesions present in several stages of development. For example, macular lesions may be observed in the same area of skin as mature vesicles.

Of these, 41 (13 percent) were reported by persons younger than 5 years old and 296 (87 percent) were reported by persons older 5 years old.\n\nThese cases were reported by TCI Hospital on Providenciales 234 (72 percent) and Grand Turk 5 (1 percent); with 28 cases in North Caicos and 60 (18 percent) cases in clinics in Providenciales. In summary, the majority cases are being reported from Providenciales (90 percent).\n\nBy comparison, in all of 2015, a total of 98 cases of chickenpox were reported by TCI Hospital in Providenciales.\n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VZV reactivates, herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact, and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash of that usually starts on the abdomen, back, or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then breaks, crusts over, and leaves dry brown scabs.\n\nThe chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered skin rather than exposed. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, and genitals.\n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days).\n\nThis disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare, but include pneumonia, encephalitis, and secondary bacterial infections.\n\nInfection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immunocompromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles.\n\nThe TCI Ministry of Health strongly advises persons affected with chickenpox to remain at home during their sick leave period to prevent further spread of this illness within the community and schools.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family is the causative agent for chickenpox. Humans are the only reservoir of the virus, and disease occurs only in humans. After primary infection as varicella (chickenpox), the virus remains dormant in the sensory-nerve ganglia and can reactivate at a later time, causing herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nVaricella occurs worldwide. In temperate climates, varicella tends to be a childhood disease, with peak incidence among preschool and school-aged children during late winter and early spring. In these countries, less than 5 percent of adults are susceptible to varicella. In tropical climates, the highest incidence was described in the driest, coolest months; overall, infection tends to be acquired later in childhood, resulting in higher susceptibility among adults than in temperate climates, especially in less densely populated areas.\n\nAll people, including those traveling or living abroad, should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those who do not have evidence of immunity or contraindications to vaccination should receive age-appropriate vaccination. Vaccination against varicella is not a requirement for entry into any country (including the United States), but people who do not have evidence of immunity should be considered at risk for varicella during international travel.\n\nVaricella vaccine contains live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is licensed for people aged 12 months and older, and the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine is licensed only for children 1-12 years. CDC recommends varicella vaccination for all people aged 12 months and older without evidence of immunity to varicella who do not have contraindications to the vaccine: 1 dose for children aged 1-4 years and 2 doses for people aged 4 years and older. The minimum interval between doses is 3 months for children aged less than 13 years and 4 weeks for people aged 13 years and older. Contraindications for vaccination include allergy to vaccine components, immune-compromising conditions or treatments, and pregnancy. When evidence of immunity is uncertain, a possible history of varicella is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.

Of them, 11 are children in the age group of 4-14 years. During a routine visit, a health worker of the department came across children having pimples and rashes. He informed the senior medical officer [SMO] of the community health centre, Sanhewal. The SMO, Dr JP Singh, after gathering more information, came to know that 3 cases of chickenpox were also reported from the OPD of the centre.\n\nThe information was passed on to the District Epidemiologist, Dr Ramesh, who reached the area with a rapid response team. The team visited 250 houses in the area and a total of 16 patients were found to be suffering from chickenpox. A camp was organised by the department and the local people were sensitised on chickenpox. Dr Ramesh said most people were taking home remedies and they were made aware regarding steps to be taken for early recovery of patients. They were also advised to isolate the patients to prevent its spread. The department will also be holding a camp tomorrow [14 Apr 2016]. Meanwhile, cases of chickenpox have scared mothers who have stopped sending their wards for playing outside and to schools as a precautionary measure.

'I have asked my daughter not to play with him till he gets well, as chickenpox is an infectious disease and she might catch it as well,' she said.\n\nHow does one contract chickenpox? Chickenpox is caused by the herpes varicella-zoster virus. It is spread by droplets from sneeze or cough, or by contact with the clothing and bed linens used by an infected person. The onset of symptoms is 10 to 21 days after exposure. When can chickenpox vaccine be given? The varicella vaccine is given when children are between 12 and 15 months old. They receive a booster shot for further protection at 4 to 6 years of age. Children who are older than 6 but younger than 13, and who have not had chickenpox also may receive the vaccine, with the 2 doses given at least 3 months apart.\n\n[Byline: Manav Mander]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chickenpox [varicella] is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the _Varicella-zoster virus_ (VZV). Following infection with VZV, the patients develop a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox may be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. The virus is transmitted easily from infected people to others who have no previous history of chickenpox or have not received the chickenpox vaccine. VZV spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters (http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/overview.html).\n\nChickenpox outbreaks generally are reported from schools or day care centers and the best precaution is early isolation i.e. confinement at home of the cases from contact with other healthy children as also mentioned in the above report. - Mod.UBA\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1789.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nChickenpox outbreaks generally are reported from schools or day care centers and the best precaution is early isolation i.e. confinement at home of the cases from contact with other healthy children as also mentioned in the above report.

Nearly 3/4ths [75 percent] of them did not receive a vaccination against the virus, and an additional 14 percent did not receive the recommended number of doses, according to the health department, which says 2 doses of the vaccine are 98 percent effective.\n\nThe city sent out an alert to physicians reminding them to make sure children are up to date with their vaccinations.\n\nThe city in September [2015] urged Orthodox schools and parents to vaccinate their children after a whooping cough outbreak.\n\nSome yeshivas have the lowest reported vaccination rates among schools in the city, according to state data.\n\nIn 2013, the city health department reported 48 cases of measles in the Orthodox Jewish community residing in Borough Park and Williamsburg [neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York City].\n\n[Byline: Dan Goldberg]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Vaccines work on the theory of herd immunity, i.e., that disease outbreaks can be prevented if a population has a high proportion of people who are immune to a given disease. Large numbers of people who opt out of vaccination lower a population's level of herd immunity. 'If you have a community where the herd immunity is very, very low and also if there's crowding or very, very large families ... then the disease could spread rapidly,' C Gill [Associate Professor at Boston University's Center for Global Health & Development and a specialist in infectious diseases and vaccines] said.\n\nSince the mid 1990s -- when the vaccine became mandatory for children entering public grade school -- chickenpox rates have predictably plummeted. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccine prevents 3.5 million cases, 9000 hospitalizations, and about 100 deaths caused by the illness every year. And despite the ongoing ruckus made by anti-vaccination activists, 90 percent of children from the ages of 19 to 35 months have gotten their 1st dose of the vaccine as of 2010. The 2nd dose is recommended at 4 to 6 years old.\n\nWhether a similar anti-vaccination sentiment explains the current outbreak is difficult to say, however. Prominent rabbis within more restrictive sects of the Orthodox community have spoken out against vaccination, and a Brooklyn measles outbreak in 2013 centered around 2 Orthodox Jewish communities in the neighborhoods of Borough Park and Williamsburg.\n\nBut other voices in the community have loudly rebuffed these vaccine skeptics, and there's seemingly no Jewish law that discourages vaccination. In 2013, a representative from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told Jewish publication Forward that 96 percent of Brooklyn students who attended yeshivas, the traditional form of education for Orthodox children, had received their necessary shots. More likely than not, then, the outbreak is the result of an isolated pocket of resistance.\n\nBecause chickenpox is highly contagious, though, health officials are advising medical providers throughout the city to stay on high alert. And to make sure that their patients and staff are fully up to date on their own shots. While the chickenpox vaccine isn't foolproof, 2 doses are about 90 percent effective at preventing the disease. People suspected of contracting chickenpox but who haven't yet shown any symptoms can also be given the vaccine up to 3 days after they were 1st exposed.\n\n(From http://www.rawstory.com/2016/05/chickenpox-outbreak-hits-nyc-orthodox-jewish-community-mostly-in-unvaccinated-kids/)\n\nA map of Williamsburg, New York can be accessed at http://www.aaccessmaps.com/images/maps/us/ny/brooklyn_n/brooklyn_n.gif.

The warm temperature that we see these days helps in activating viruses and bacteria that attack people, especially with low immunity,' says Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Hospital.\n\nPeople at high risk are those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, blood pressure, cancer, chronic kidney ailment, HIV or tuberculosis and people on steroids or other immunity-suppressing medicines.\n\nNormally, red-coloured rashes appear within 24 hours of a person getting fever, up to 102 Fahrenheit, which turn into fluid-filled blisters, before finally crusting over. The blisters are itchy and take about 10 days to crust over. A person develops relative immunity toward chickenpox for life.\n\n'The virus lies dormant. There may be a local infection at some point that makes skin to flare up, but the disease per se happens only once in a life time,' said a doctor from the paediatrics department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.\n\nThe chickenpox virus Varicella-zoster uses droplets in the air to travel. If a person with the infection coughs or sneezes near a healthy person, he or she might contract it.\n\nA person may also contract the infection if exposed to the fluid from the eruptions.\n\nChickenpox is a common childhood disease. But when people catch the disease for the 1st time as adults, the symptoms tend to be severe.\n\nEarlier there was no specific treatment for chickenpox, but these days certain anti-viral drugs are available that minimise its magnitude significantly. The disease is mostly treated at the symptomatic level, to reduce severe itchiness and to bring down fever.\n\nDue to its highly contagious nature, doctors advise people to stay away from those who have developed rashes on skin, usually within 24 hours of getting fever.\n\nThe vaccine Varicella costs about Rs 1500 [about USD 22] and is the widely used protection against chickenpox. However, due to its high cost, doctors feel it is not feasible for everyone to use it. 'It's not part of the national immunisation programme purely because of its high cost and also the disease normally is not of very serious nature. The vaccine is good for those who can afford it, otherwise it should be given mainly to high-risk people,' said Dr Sharma.\n\nAccording to the doctors, it takes about 2-3 days to develop immunity against the disease, hence, it is important to take the vaccine shot immediately after a near one has developed symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of chickenpox\n----------------------\n- A rash that usually begins on the body and face and later often spreads to the scalp and limbs\n- The rash is often itchy\n- It begins as small red spots which develop into blisters in a couple of hours\n- After a couple of days, the blisters turn into scabs\n- New blisters may appear after 3-6 days\n- High grade fever\n- Severe head and body ache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Children have mild symptoms\n- In children, the symptoms last 7-10 days, and longer in adults.\n- Adults get severe symptoms and take longer to recover.

The virus spreads easily from people with chickenpox to others who have never had the disease or been vaccinated. The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk, for example.\n\nA person with chickenpox can spread the disease from 1-2 days before they get the rash until all their chickenpox blisters have formed scabs (usually 5-7 days). It takes about 2 weeks (from 10 to 21 days) after exposure to a person with chickenpox for someone to develop chickenpox. If a person vaccinated for chickenpox gets the disease, they can still spread it to others.\n\nVZV causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. The rash appears first on the stomach, back and face and can spread over the entire body causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nFor most people, getting chickenpox once provides immunity for life. However, for a few people, they can get chickenpox more than once, although this is not common.\n\nThe best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing the disease. Most people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox.

The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk, for example. She said that it is not sufficient for parents to say their children had chickenpox to be allowed to return to school. The virus spreads easily from people with chickenpox to others who have never had the disease or been vaccinated.

In light of this finding, patients with a history of eye inflammation should consult a health care provider before getting vaccinated against varicella zoster virus, they advised. After studying more than 12 million case reports from national and international registries, the researchers uncovered at least 20 cases of keratitis in children and adults that occurred within a month of varicella vaccine administration. The symptoms of keratitis developed within 24 days of vaccination among the adults and within 14 days among the children.\n\n'The vaccine is a live virus, and in rare, susceptible individuals, this can cause a reaction in the eye in the form of herpes-zoster keratitis,' Frederick W. Fraunfelder, MD, MBA, director of the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects and chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at the MU School of Medicine, explained to Pharmacy Times.\n\nAccording to Dr. Fraunfelder, pharmacists should keep the following things in mind when administering the varicella vaccine.\n\n1. Ask questions about eye health history before administering the vaccine.\n\nDr. Fraunfelder said pharmacists should ask patients the following 2 questions:\n- Do you have a history of zoster or shingles in or around the eye(s)?\n- Do you have a past ocular history of herpes virus affecting your eyes?\n\n2. Keep in mind that keratitis can occur in patients with no prior eye-related problems.\n\n'Most of the keratitis cases reported [in the study] occurred without any prior eye-related events. This is especially true in the pediatric age group who get chickenpox vaccines,' Dr. Fraunfelder noted.\n\n3. Counsel patients about the rare risk of varicella vaccine-related keratitis.\n\nPharmacists should inform patients about the rare risk of a zoster-keratitis reaction, especially those who have experienced it in the past.\n\n'It is helpful to be informed, and if a reaction occurs, [the patient] probably shouldn't get the vaccine ever again,' Dr. Fraunfelder said.\n\n4. Look for eye symptoms after vaccination.\n\n'Blurred vision, red eye, cloudy cornea, and light sensitivity are some warning signs that can start appearing within days to weeks after administration,' Dr. Fraunfelder said.\n\n5. If keratitis symptoms present, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist.\n\n'Referral to an ophthalmologist is important, as the long-term sequelae of the condition can be minimized with treatment,' Dr. Fraunfelder explained. 'After that, a subspecialist would administer steroids and/or antivirals.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The study, 'Varicella and Zoster Vaccine-associated Keratitis,' was presented at the 2015 meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in Las Vegas.

The school was closed for the week to monitor and treat affected students.\n\nThis pustulovesicular rash represents a generalized herpes outbreak due to the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) pathogen/CDC.\n\nLast week, the Ministry of Health screened over 400 students from the St. George's Anglican School. The exercise saw a team of qualified nursing personnel conducting screening and evaluation of students at the St. George's Anglican Junior and Senior Schools.\n\nA total of 255 and 183 students from the junior and senior schools respectively were examined on the compound as the institution reopened its doors following the completion of sanitation and cleaning operations.\n\nDuring the screening/examination at the school, several students with skin lesions, fever, cold, headaches and skin rashes were identified and were not given clearance for a return to the classroom. Some of the students were referred to the doctor, and others were requested to be observed at home.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry will undertake a daily monitoring of the school, conduct education sessions with teachers and undertake another medical evaluation of students, in particular the ones that are to be observed at home and referred.\n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. This virus causes 2 distinct diseases; varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection, and later when VSV reactivates, herpes zoster (shingles).\n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. You can also get it by contact with the vesicle secretions from shingles.\n\nThe disease is characterized by fever and a red, itchy skin rash that usually starts on the abdomen, back or face and then spreads to nearly all parts of the body. The rash begins as small red bumps that appear as pimples or insect bites. They then develop into thin-walled blisters that are filled with clear fluid which collapse on puncture. The blisters then break, crust over, and leave dry brown scabs.\n\nThe chickenpox lesions may be present in several stages of maturity and are more abundant on covered skin rather than exposed. Lesions may also be found in the mouth, upper respiratory tract and genitals.\n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days).\n\nThis disease is more serious in adults than in children. Complications of chickenpox are rare, but include pneumonia, encephalitis and secondary bacterial infections.\n\nInfection with this virus usually gives lifelong immunity, although 2nd attacks have been documented in immunocompromised people. The viral infection remains latent, and disease may recur years later as shingles.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the chickenpox vaccine is the best protection against chickenpox. The vaccine is made from weakened varicella virus that produces an immune response in your body that protects you against chickenpox. The chickenpox vaccine was licensed for use in the United States in 1995.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of Grenada can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Varicella - USA (North Carolina) schoolchildren\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2016\nSource: Charlotte Observer [edited]\nhttp://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/article64604577.html\n\n\n[A] 5-year-old doesn't have chickenpox. But 5 other elementary students in Union County do. And because [the 5-year-old] hasn't been vaccinated against the childhood illness, she is one of 15 children who have been ordered by the county health director to stay out of school, in quarantine, for 21 days.\n\n[The 5-year-old]'s mother, of Indian Trail, is confused and angry about the health department's decision. She questions why her child -- and the other healthy, unvaccinated children -- should be sent home when the vaccination didn't prevent the other children from getting sick.\n\n'There's nothing wrong with her, but she can't come back to school for 21 days,' [she] said. 'The only ones with the virus are the ones that got the vaccination.'\n\nHedrick said her daughter, a kindergartner at Poplin Elementary, 'can go to the public library. She can go to the grocery store. We can go out to eat. But she cannot go to school. We are not talking about Ebola. We are not talking about the plague. We are talking about chickenpox.'\n\nThe 5 children with chickenpox, also called varicella, attend Poplin and Hemby Bridge elementary schools, and all had been vaccinated, said Union County Health Director Phillip Tarte.\n\n'The very nature of isolation in this instance is to remove the most vulnerable away from the disease,' Tarte told the Observer in an email. Although the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, he said those who get the vaccine and then get chickenpox 'have a greater level of protection to avoid complications.'\n\nIn justifying the quarantine, Tarte quoted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 'Children who lack evidence of immunity and whose parents refuse vaccination should be excluded from school from the start of the outbreak through 21 days after rash onset of the last identified case.'\n\nUnlike measles and mumps, chickenpox is not required to be reported to health officials, so there are no good statistics on the number of cases. In Mecklenburg County, Dr. Stephen Keener, the Health Department's medical director, said he hasn't had a report of chickenpox in the past year and has never ordered a quarantine of healthy children during a chickenpox outbreak.\n\nKeener did order a quarantine in late 2014 after a case of measles was reported. The quarantine orders went to a few people who had direct contact with the measles victim and who could not produce documentation of vaccination.\n\nChickenpox, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is highly contagious and spreads by direct contact or through the air by coughing or sneezing. It takes 10 to 21 days to develop symptoms after being exposed to someone with the disease. Recovery from chickenpox confers long lasting natural immunity.\n\nMany cases of chickenpox are mild, but deaths can occur from the disease. The vaccine was licensed for use in the United States in 1995. Before that, about 100 people died every year in the United States from the disease. The vaccine has also been linked with injuries. Since creation of the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, it has received a total of 125 claims -- 9 deaths and 116 serious injuries -- related to the chickenpox vaccine. Compensation was awarded in 71 cases, and 28 were dismissed.\n\nThe mother said she declined to get her daughter vaccinated against chickenpox and other childhood illnesses because her older child, now 8, had bad reactions -- from ear infections to drug-resistant pneumonia -- after receiving vaccines as a small child. 'We went through a very traumatic time with him,' she said.\n\n{The 8-year-old] received vaccinations only until he was 2. After that, [his mother] got religious exemptions that allow both children to attend school without having received all the mandatory childhood vaccines.\n\nKeeping [the 5-year-old] at home has created challenges for the family. [the mother], who works for Wells Fargo, has arranged to work from home and help her with homework until the quarantine is over on 17 Mar 2016. She has also hired a tutor for [the child], who is in the school's Spanish immersion program.\n\n[Byline: Karen Garloch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Note, it is not a pox virus. The virus is an airborne pathogen that spreads easily; one can get it from an infected person who sneezes, coughs, or shares food or drinks, or if one touches the fluid from a chickenpox blister. A person who has chickenpox can spread the virus even before he or she has any symptoms.\n\nThe disease is vaccine preventable, although the vaccine is 70-90% effective. Vaccinated individuals who come down with the disease are generally protected from the most severe symptoms.\n\nThe vaccine was licensed in the US in 1995. Prior to that, in the early 1990s, an average of 4 million people got chickenpox; 10 500-13 000 were hospitalized (range, 8000 to 18 000), and 100 to 150 died each year.\n\nThe chickenpox vaccine carries less risk of severe disease than does getting the disease, and most people who get the vaccine do not have any problems with it. Nonetheless, as stated in the report, rare side effects may occur. Serious side effects to the chickenpox vaccine are very rare and more often are evident after the 1st dose than after the 2nd one.\n\nAccording to the CDC, possible reactions include: soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given, fever, mild rash or several small bumps after vaccination, as well as seizure (jerking and staring spells) that may be caused by fever. Seizures after chickenpox vaccination may or may not be related to chickenpox vaccine.\n\nSerious side effects from chickenpox vaccine are extremely rare, but may include severe brain reactions and low blood count.\n\nThe issue raised by this report, i.e., prohibiting unvaccinated healthy children from attending school following evidence of varicella cases in the school, is a difficult one and very controversial. This practice is recommended by the CDC to protect those most vulnerable. As noted from the numbers above, the vaccine -- even though not 100% effective -- apparently has greatly decreased the number of cases. The exact incidence is unknown, though, since varicella is not a reportable disease. Certainly, vaccination is the most effective protection available against serious disease. But where vaccination of schoolchildren is voluntary and not mandatory, the situation described in this report will have to be confronted every time cases occur in a classroom setting.\n\nFor more information on the vaccine, see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/varicella/basic-side-effects.htm, and for information on the disease, see http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/p0000108/p0000108.asp#head001000000000000.\n\nA map of North Carolina, USA can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nChickenpox is a common, usually benign childhood disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes family. \n\nChickenpox, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is highly contagious and spreads by direct contact or through the air by coughing or sneezing. \n\nChickenpox is contagious from 1-2 days before the rash forms and continues until all the lesions are crusted over (usually about 5 days). \n\nThe 5 children with chickenpox, also called varicella, attend Poplin and Hemby Bridge elementary schools, and all had been vaccinated, said Union County Health Director Phillip Tarte. \n\nChickenpox is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact and by aerosolization of the virus from skin lesions. \n\nSerious side effects from chickenpox vaccine are extremely rare, but may include severe brain reactions and low blood count.

At Jonesville Elementary school, almost 60 of\nthe school's 480 students have been diagnosed with or displayed\nsymptoms of chickenpox over the past month. The exact cause of the\nchild's death has not been determined, but local health officials say\nthey doubt chickenpox is to blame. The classic symptoms of this\nhighly contagious disease are blisters that break out and scab over\nafter a few days. Oftentimes, the blisters are preceded by a headache\nand fever.\nAccording to the school's principal, the outbreak isn't limited just\nto students who haven't been vaccinated. 'We have had both kids who\nhave had vaccination and those that haven't to have the chickenpox,'\nsaid principal Rick Swaim.\nAcross the state, the current class of kindergartners was the 1st\nrequired by law to be vaccinated for chickenpox. In September [2006],\nthe state issued a recommendation urging parents to get a 2nd booster\nshot. Because the disease appears to be so widespread -- affecting\nnot just Jonesville, but also West Yadkin and Booneville elementary\nschools -- the Yadkin County Health Department has sent out a letter\nto notify parents and doctors.\nAll over North Carolina, parents are being urged to make sure their\nchildren have both the vaccine and the booster.

Lass, M.D.' <nlass@midway.uchicago.edu>\nDate: Thu, 11 Jan 1996 09:22:38 -0600 (CST)\n\nVaricella is indeed a significant infection in the newborn infant. The\nvaricella zoster virus is a known human teratogen. Fetuses exposed in utero\nmay exhibit skin lesions, limb abnormalities, eye abnormalities including\ncataracts, chorioretinitis or blindness, brain atrophy, mental retardation,\nand death. Those infants who are exposed in utero and delivered before the\ntransfer of significant maternal antibody are at risk for severe infection\nand a 20-30% mortality rate (this would include infants whose mothers\ndeveloped the disease within 5 days prior to delivery or within 2 days\nafter; generally refers to infants developing a rash between the first 5-10\ndays of life). Infants developing a rash in the first 5 days usually have\nreceived some maternal antibody and have a less severe course. Those\ninfants developing the varicella rash after 10 days generally are felt to\nhave acquired the disease after birth and also tend to do better.\nGenerally, an infant born to a mother who has developed varicella within 5\ndays of delivery should receive varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) 125\nunits within 48 hours of delivery, preferably as soon as possible. This\nwill not prevent neonatal varicella, but will modify its course. Acyclovir\nmay also modify the course, but should not be necessary if VZIG has been\ngiven. Isolation of the mother and baby may be necessary depending on\nwhether mother is in incubation period, baby is in a neonatal intensive care\nunit, etc.\nFurther information can be obtained from the following texts:\n'Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine', Fanaroff and Martin, eds.

Whether maternal immunoglobulin has anything\nto do with it is not clear to me given the short time frame and\nthe fact that IgM traditionally does not cross the placenta.\nI would interpret the appearance of the baby's rash at that point as\nbeing indicative of transplacental spread of VZV [varicella-zoster\nvirus] during the initial low level viraemic phase which occurs\nat about three days after initial infection (it is this low level wave\nthat you are trying to block with the neutralising antibody in\nV-ZIG [varicella-zoster immune globulin] when you give it to exposed at risk\nindividuals). Spread at this stage would seem to be a little unusual,\nbut by no means inconceivable. If this is so, then the baby may\nwell have been exposed to VZV for long enough to benefit from whatever\nspecific or non specific responses might have been transferred\ntrans-placentally, but perhaps more importantly, might have also been\nable to mount a response itself.\nThese postulates notwithstanding, I would have a very low threshold\nfor starting this infant on intravenous acyclovir, and would have expect\nV-ZIG to have little if any effect on the clinical course of the\nillness.\nTwo references from a quick search are appended, but the chapter on\nVZV infection in Remington and Klein, 'Infectious Diseases of the\nFetus and Newborn Infant' is likely to give you all the info you need\nand all the key references.\n89343356\nOutcome in newborn babies given anti-varicella-zoster immunoglobulin after\nperinatal maternal infection with varicella-zoster virus.\nMiller E; Cradock-Watson JE; Ridehalgh MK\nLancet (ENGLAND) Aug 12 1989 2 (8659) p371-3 ISSN: 0140-6736\n281 newborn babies whose mothers had chickenpox and 25 whose mothers had\nherpes zoster during the perinatal period were investigated.

[The 15th Asian Games are\nbeing held in Doha, Qatar from 1 to 15 Dec 2006. The Maldives\nvolleyball team was scheduled to participate in a pre-Games\nqualifying round. - Mod.CP]\nThe disease hit 3 members of the Indian Ocean [Maldives] island's\nvolleyball squad. Dr. Abdullah Al-Mussleh, the Games program manager\nfor health care and doping control, said that the disease was 1st\nspotted in one player shortly after his arrival in Doha. 'He was\nimmediately isolated, and all of the national Olympic committee of\nthe team concerned was screened for chickenpox. None of them showed\nany indication of the disease at that stage,' said Dr. Al-Mussleh.\nEight of the team were immune from the disease, but 7 were not. The\nwhole team has since been isolated, and all are on anti-viral\nmedicine. On Tuesday [28 Nov 2006], 2 more Maldives volleyball\nplayers developed chickenpox rash, and they have also been isolated\nat the city's main Hamad Hospital. 'One has chickenpox; the other has\na high possibility of having chickenpox,' added Dr. Al-Mussleh.\nAs a result of the outbreak, the team was forced to cancel its match\nagainst Taiwan on Tuesday [28 Nov 2006]. But the Olympic Council of\nAsia (OCA) has said that the team will be free to resume their\ncampaign as volleyball is not a contact sport.\n--\nBrent Barrett\nIndianapolis, IN, USA\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Varicella (chickenpox) is caused by Human herpesvirus 3 (formerly\nknown as Varicella-zoster virus) resulting in febrile illness in\nchildren and occasionally adults, and herpes-zoster (shingles/hives)\nin adults. Chickenpox is a common childhood illness, with an\nincubation period of about 2 weeks, with a characteristic rash and\nmild fever. In adults, illness can be more severe, with a painful\nrash developing centripetally on the face and trunk. The rash becomes\nvesicular and eventually resolves.\nThe virus is spread by the respiratory route and in some individuals\nbecomes latent in a dorsal route ganglion. Reactivation of infection\noccurs predominantly to the elderly and immune-compromised.\nIn temperate climates, chickenpox is primarily a disease of\nchildhood, but there is some evidence that the age of onset may be\nlater in the Indian sub-continent. Consequently, there may be some\nenhanced risk of transmission of this virus among participants in the\nAsian Games in Doha, notwithstanding the fact that volleyball is not\na contact sport.\nA map of Qatar showing the location of Doha can be accessed at\n<http://geography.about.com/library/cia/blcqatar.htm>.\n- Mod.CP]\n[This outbreak is being posted as an alert as the participants in\nthese athletic games include members from 45 countries (Afghanistan,\nBahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Taiwan, North\nKorea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan,\nKazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Macau, Malaysia,\nMaldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian team,\nPhilippines, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka,\nSyria, Tajikistan, Thailand, East Timor, Turkmenistan, United Arab\nEmirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen). Hence, the threat of\nimportation of cases to other countries is high. The incubation\nperiod is approximately 7-21 days, and participants returning to\ntheir home countries might very well be within the incubation period\nfor clinical illness onset upon after return to their homes.
