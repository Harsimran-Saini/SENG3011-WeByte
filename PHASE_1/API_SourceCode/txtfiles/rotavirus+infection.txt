Currently\nall 22 miners are undergoing treatment. The management at the mine are\nproviding all necessary facilities for treatment and diagnosis. The\npublic health epidemiological surveillance service has initiated an\ninvestigation, but no information is available as yet.\n\nIt is not the 1st outbreak of rotavirus infection in the area. Two\nweeks ago an outbreak of rotavirus infection was registered in the\n\"Juravushka\" kindergarten involving 5 children aged between 2 and 2.5\nyears of age. It is expected that these children will soon be\ndischarged from hospital.\n\nRotavirus can be transmitted through direct contact and water.
