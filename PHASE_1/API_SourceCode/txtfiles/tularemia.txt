The resident developed a lung infection from tularemia, which can be transmitted to people through insect bites, contaminated soil, or contact with an infected animal, according to a press release from the health department.\n\nAll warm-blooded animals, including pets and livestock, are susceptible to tularemia, though the bacterium normally occurs in rabbits, hares, muskrats, beaver, and small rodents. The bacterium that causes tularemia is in the urine and droppings of sick animals, contaminating the soil through that means. When a person turns up soil while gardening, mowing, or even blowing leaves, the bacteria can be inhaled, causing a pneumonic form of tularemia, the department stated.\n\nThe organism also can be transferred through contaminated food and water or even by putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth after outdoor activities. Other ways to contract tularemia are through insect bites and by handling dead animals, according to a news release. Bacteria in animals can persist in soil or water for weeks, and it takes only a small amount to cause a transmission.\n\nByline: Pamela Johnson\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or via an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage to the next.

The resident developed a lung infection from tularemia, which can be transmitted to people through insect bites, contaminated soil, or contact with an infected animal, according to a press release from the health department.\n\nAll warm-blooded animals, including pets and livestock, are susceptible to tularemia, though the bacterium normally occurs in rabbits, hares, muskrats, beaver, and small rodents. The bacterium that causes tularemia is in the urine and droppings of sick animals, contaminating the soil through that means. When a person turns up soil while gardening, mowing, or even blowing leaves, the bacteria can be inhaled, causing a pneumonic form of tularemia, the department stated.\n\nThe organism also can be transferred through contaminated food and water or even by putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth after outdoor activities. Other ways to contract tularemia are through insect bites and by handling dead animals, according to a news release. Bacteria in animals can persist in soil or water for weeks, and it takes only a small amount to cause a transmission.\n\nByline: Pamela Johnson\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or via an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _D. variabilis_ (dog tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe infection does not spread from person to person, essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.\n\n_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1).

The resident developed a lung infection from tularemia, which can be transmitted to people through insect bites, contaminated soil, or contact with an infected animal, according to a press release from the health department.\n\nAll warm-blooded animals, including pets and livestock, are susceptible to tularemia, though the bacterium normally occurs in rabbits, hares, muskrats, beaver, and small rodents. The bacterium that causes tularemia is in the urine and droppings of sick animals, contaminating the soil through that means. When a person turns up soil while gardening, mowing, or even blowing leaves, the bacteria can be inhaled, causing a pneumonic form of tularemia, the department stated.\n\nThe organism also can be transferred through contaminated food and water or even by putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth after outdoor activities. Other ways to contract tularemia are through insect bites and by handling dead animals, according to a news release. Bacteria in animals can persist in soil or water for weeks, and it takes only a small amount to cause a transmission.\n\nByline: Pamela Johnson\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or via an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _D. variabilis_ (dog tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe infection does not spread from person to person, essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.\n\n_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1). A good review of the subject written by Thomas and Schaffner can be found in reference 2.\n\nCitations\n----------\n1. Foshay L. Cause of death in tularemia.

These last 4 people, as it turned out, visited the village of Artsvaberd. Currently, only 1 of the infected people continues to receive inpatient treatment. There were no severe cases of illness. Artavazd Vanyan, Head of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention of MoH, said this during the parliamentary hearings in the Standing Committee on Health Care, Maternity and Social Welfare issues.\n\nAccording to him, the first case was clinically detected on [29 Aug 2017]. He was a resident of Yerevan who applied to the Nork infectious hospital. In early August [2017], this person had visited the village of Artsvaberd of Tavush region. The specialists of the Center visited the village and found out that some villagers already had some clinical manifestations of tularemia, and had been locally wrongfully treated for angina.\n\nAccording to Artavazd Vanyan, the investigation has shown that the infection in the village of Artsvaberd occurred from the end of July [2017] to the middle of August [2017]. The causative agent of tularemia was not isolated during the investigation of water and food samples, or from animals. That is, the infection occurred without a clear epizootic. The Center came to the conclusion that the infection could occur by air/dust- borne during haymaking, which is evidence of its forms, oculoglandular and angino-glandular [oroglandular? - Mod.LL], as well as the fact that all the affected lived close to one another.\n\n\"This is the first time in Armenia when people got sick with tularemia without a clear animal infection, and the first time that the transmission of the pathogen occurred by air/dust,\" Artavazd Vanyan said.\n\nHe added that the Artsvaberd village is located in the border with Azerbaijan, and Armenian specialists cannot conduct surveys of the entire territory. According to Artavazd Vanyan, Azerbaijan, like Armenia, is an endemic country for tularemia, and, probably, penetration of the animal reservoir took place from that side.\n\nTaking into account that the risk of infection continues, the Center decided to vaccinate all residents over 7 years of the village of Artsvaberd and neighboring villages - Chinari, Norashen, Choratan and Aygedzor. Vaccination, in his words, will protect them from tularemia in the next 5 years.\n\nAnswering the question of Ms. Margarita Yesayan, parliamentarian, about the possibility of deliberate contamination of Armenian territories, Artavazd Vanyan noted that, judging by the fact that there was a local outbreak, and not an epidemic, this seems unlikely.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic infection in which patients experience intoxication, fever, and lymph node involvement.

Any further clarification of the translation would be appreciated.\n\nGuessing that angina-glandular likely means oropharyngeal involvement (as angina can refer to a severe sore throat); the presence of these manifestations suggests aerosolization of _F. tularensis_ with infection in the throat and conjunctivae. Contaminated hay or grass when manipulated could have caused infectious aerosols. Water transmission could have occurred but is less likely given oculoglandular involvement unless swimming was involved.\n\nA recent report regarding oculoglandular and oropharyngeal tularemia from Turkey is: Eren Gok S, Kocagul Celikbas A, Baykam N, et al: Evaluation of tularemia cases focusing on the oculoglandular form. J Infect Dev Ctries. 2014;8: 1277-1284. doi: 10.3855/jidc.3996. Available at: https://jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/25313604/1168.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\"Introduction: Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by _Francisella tularensis_. The oculoglandular form is one of the rarest forms. In this study, we evaluated tularemia patients, focusing on the ocular form and the efficacy of early antimicrobial therapy.\n\n\"Methodology: During a tularemia outbreak, the epidemiological and clinical findings, laboratory assays, and drugs used for the treatment of 48 patients were recorded prospectively. The diagnosis of tularemia was confirmed with microagglutination test (MAT) as well as clinical findings.\n\n\"Results: The mean age of the subject was 48.6 years; 23 (47.9 percent) of them were female. 36 (81.25 percent) patients had clinical presentation compatible with oropharyngeal tularemia, 7 (14.58 percent) with oculoglandular tularemia, and 2 (4.1 percent) with ulceroglandular tularemia. The most common symptoms were fever (91.6 percent) and sore throat (81.2 percent), and the most common findings were lymphadenopathy (91.6 percent) and tonsillopharyngitis (81.2 percent). In the oculoglandular form, fever, lymphadenopathy, periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis were found. The most distinctive ophthalmic feature was follicular conjunctivitis and conjunctival epithelial defects. A total of 45 cases had positive serological results with MAT. All the patients were treated with antimicrobials considered effective against _F. tularensis_, and topical antimicrobial treatment was given to the patients with oculoglandular tularemia. As many as 26 (54.16 percent) patients, who were admitted within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms, recovered without sequel.\n\n\"Conclusions: During tularemia outbreaks, ocular involvement should be considered carefully. The early administration of appropriate treatment will be more effective in resolving the infection and preventing complications. Along with systemic antimicrobial therapy, topical treatment will help recovery.\"\n\nAgain, ProMED would much appreciate any other suggestions regarding the translation. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/133.]\nSee Also\nTularemia - Armenia: (TV) RFI 20171002.5355480\n2016\n----\nTularemia - Ukraine: (KR) 20160204.3995341\n2015\n----\nTularemia, animal - Czech Republic: (MO) hare 20150523.3380738\nTularemia - Kosovo (02) 20150216.3170249\nTularemia - Kosovo: RFI 20150212.3161852\n2013\n----\nTularemia - Russia (02): (KM) 20130919.1954010\nTularemia - Russia: (KM) 20130825.1898671\n2012\n----\nTularemia - Russia (02): (KX) susp.

The most common symptoms were fever (91.6 percent) and sore throat (81.2 percent), and the most common findings were lymphadenopathy (91.6 percent) and tonsillopharyngitis (81.2 percent). In the oculoglandular form, fever, lymphadenopathy, periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis were found. The most distinctive ophthalmic feature was follicular conjunctivitis and conjunctival epithelial defects. A total of 45 cases had positive serological results with MAT.

These last 4 people, as it turned out, visited the village of Artsvaberd. Currently, only 1 of the infected people continues to receive inpatient treatment. There were no severe cases of illness. Artavazd Vanyan, Head of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention of MoH, said this during the parliamentary hearings in the Standing Committee on Health Care, Maternity and Social Welfare issues.\n\nAccording to him, the first case was clinically detected on [29 Aug 2017]. He was a resident of Yerevan who applied to the Nork infectious hospital. In early August [2017], this person had visited the village of Artsvaberd of Tavush region. The specialists of the Center visited the village and found out that some villagers already had some clinical manifestations of tularemia, and had been locally wrongfully treated for angina.\n\nAccording to Artavazd Vanyan, the investigation has shown that the infection in the village of Artsvaberd occurred from the end of July [2017] to the middle of August [2017]. The causative agent of tularemia was not isolated during the investigation of water and food samples, or from animals. That is, the infection occurred without a clear epizootic. The Center came to the conclusion that the infection could occur by air/dust- borne during haymaking, which is evidence of its forms, oculoglandular and angino-glandular [oroglandular? - Mod.LL], as well as the fact that all the affected lived close to one another.\n\n\"This is the first time in Armenia when people got sick with tularemia without a clear animal infection, and the first time that the transmission of the pathogen occurred by air/dust,\" Artavazd Vanyan said.\n\nHe added that the Artsvaberd village is located in the border with Azerbaijan, and Armenian specialists cannot conduct surveys of the entire territory. According to Artavazd Vanyan, Azerbaijan, like Armenia, is an endemic country for tularemia, and, probably, penetration of the animal reservoir took place from that side.\n\nTaking into account that the risk of infection continues, the Center decided to vaccinate all residents over 7 years of the village of Artsvaberd and neighboring villages - Chinari, Norashen, Choratan and Aygedzor. Vaccination, in his words, will protect them from tularemia in the next 5 years.\n\nAnswering the question of Ms. Margarita Yesayan, parliamentarian, about the possibility of deliberate contamination of Armenian territories, Artavazd Vanyan noted that, judging by the fact that there was a local outbreak, and not an epidemic, this seems unlikely.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic infection in which patients experience intoxication, fever, and lymph node involvement. The causative agent of the disease is _Francisella tularensis_. Some animals, including rabbits, hare and water rats are considered carriers of tularemia bacteria. Infection is transmitted to a person by direct contact with sick animals or through contaminated food and water. There are fewer cases of tularemia infection by aspiration - for example, when processing grain products, threshing bread, and sometimes there are cases of infection through blood-sucking arthropods.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED sincerely thanks the EpiCore members who were able to supply the original citation in Armenian and then translate it into a cogent form.

These last 4 people, as it turned out, visited the village of Artsvaberd. Currently, only 1 of the infected people continues to receive inpatient treatment. There were no severe cases of illness. Artavazd Vanyan, Head of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention of MoH, said this during the parliamentary hearings in the Standing Committee on Health Care, Maternity and Social Welfare issues.\n\nAccording to him, the first case was clinically detected on [29 Aug 2017]. He was a resident of Yerevan who applied to the Nork infectious hospital. In early August [2017], this person had visited the village of Artsvaberd of Tavush region. The specialists of the Center visited the village and found out that some villagers already had some clinical manifestations of tularemia, and had been locally wrongfully treated for angina.\n\nAccording to Artavazd Vanyan, the investigation has shown that the infection in the village of Artsvaberd occurred from the end of July [2017] to the middle of August [2017]. The causative agent of tularemia was not isolated during the investigation of water and food samples, or from animals. That is, the infection occurred without a clear epizootic. The Center came to the conclusion that the infection could occur by air/dust- borne during haymaking, which is evidence of its forms, oculoglandular and angino-glandular [oroglandular? - Mod.LL], as well as the fact that all the affected lived close to one another.\n\n\"This is the first time in Armenia when people got sick with tularemia without a clear animal infection, and the first time that the transmission of the pathogen occurred by air/dust,\" Artavazd Vanyan said.\n\nHe added that the Artsvaberd village is located in the border with Azerbaijan, and Armenian specialists cannot conduct surveys of the entire territory. According to Artavazd Vanyan, Azerbaijan, like Armenia, is an endemic country for tularemia, and, probably, penetration of the animal reservoir took place from that side.\n\nTaking into account that the risk of infection continues, the Center decided to vaccinate all residents over 7 years of the village of Artsvaberd and neighboring villages - Chinari, Norashen, Choratan and Aygedzor. Vaccination, in his words, will protect them from tularemia in the next 5 years.\n\nAnswering the question of Ms. Margarita Yesayan, parliamentarian, about the possibility of deliberate contamination of Armenian territories, Artavazd Vanyan noted that, judging by the fact that there was a local outbreak, and not an epidemic, this seems unlikely.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic infection in which patients experience intoxication, fever, and lymph node involvement. The causative agent of the disease is _Francisella tularensis_. Some animals, including rabbits, hare and water rats are considered carriers of tularemia bacteria. Infection is transmitted to a person by direct contact with sick animals or through contaminated food and water. There are fewer cases of tularemia infection by aspiration - for example, when processing grain products, threshing bread, and sometimes there are cases of infection through blood-sucking arthropods.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED sincerely thanks the EpiCore members who were able to supply the original citation in Armenian and then translate it into a cogent form. SB and I, using Google Translate, produced a version that was only partly understandable. Any further clarification of the translation would be appreciated.\n\nGuessing that angina-glandular likely means oropharyngeal involvement (as angina can refer to a severe sore throat); the presence of these manifestations suggests aerosolization of _F. tularensis_ with infection in the throat and conjunctivae. Contaminated hay or grass when manipulated could have caused infectious aerosols. Water transmission could have occurred but is less likely given oculoglandular involvement unless swimming was involved.\n\nA recent report regarding oculoglandular and oropharyngeal tularemia from Turkey is: Eren Gok S, Kocagul Celikbas A, Baykam N, et al: Evaluation of tularemia cases focusing on the oculoglandular form.

Available at: https://jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/25313604/1168.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\"Introduction: Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by _Francisella tularensis_. The oculoglandular form is one of the rarest forms. In this study, we evaluated tularemia patients, focusing on the ocular form and the efficacy of early antimicrobial therapy.\n\n\"Methodology: During a tularemia outbreak, the epidemiological and clinical findings, laboratory assays, and drugs used for the treatment of 48 patients were recorded prospectively. The diagnosis of tularemia was confirmed with microagglutination test (MAT) as well as clinical findings.\n\n\"Results: The mean age of the subject was 48.6 years; 23 (47.9 percent) of them were female. 36 (81.25 percent) patients had clinical presentation compatible with oropharyngeal tularemia, 7 (14.58 percent) with oculoglandular tularemia, and 2 (4.1 percent) with ulceroglandular tularemia. The most common symptoms were fever (91.6 percent) and sore throat (81.2 percent), and the most common findings were lymphadenopathy (91.6 percent) and tonsillopharyngitis (81.2 percent). In the oculoglandular form, fever, lymphadenopathy, periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis were found. The most distinctive ophthalmic feature was follicular conjunctivitis and conjunctival epithelial defects. A total of 45 cases had positive serological results with MAT. All the patients were treated with antimicrobials considered effective against _F. tularensis_, and topical antimicrobial treatment was given to the patients with oculoglandular tularemia. As many as 26 (54.16 percent) patients, who were admitted within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms, recovered without sequel.\n\n\"Conclusions: During tularemia outbreaks, ocular involvement should be considered carefully. The early administration of appropriate treatment will be more effective in resolving the infection and preventing complications.

The specialists of the Center visited the village and found out that some villagers already had some clinical manifestations of tularemia, and had been locally wrongfully treated for angina.\n\nAccording to Artavazd Vanyan, the investigation has shown that the infection in the village of Artsvaberd occurred from the end of July [2017] to the middle of August [2017]. The causative agent of tularemia was not isolated during the investigation of water and food samples, or from animals. That is, the infection occurred without a clear epizootic. The Center came to the conclusion that the infection could occur by air/dust- borne during haymaking, which is evidence of its forms, oculoglandular and angino-glandular [oroglandular? - Mod.LL], as well as the fact that all the affected lived close to one another.\n\n\"This is the first time in Armenia when people got sick with tularemia without a clear animal infection, and the first time that the transmission of the pathogen occurred by air/dust,\" Artavazd Vanyan said.\n\nHe added that the Artsvaberd village is located in the border with Azerbaijan, and Armenian specialists cannot conduct surveys of the entire territory. According to Artavazd Vanyan, Azerbaijan, like Armenia, is an endemic country for tularemia, and, probably, penetration of the animal reservoir took place from that side.\n\nTaking into account that the risk of infection continues, the Center decided to vaccinate all residents over 7 years of the village of Artsvaberd and neighboring villages - Chinari, Norashen, Choratan and Aygedzor. Vaccination, in his words, will protect them from tularemia in the next 5 years.\n\nAnswering the question of Ms. Margarita Yesayan, parliamentarian, about the possibility of deliberate contamination of Armenian territories, Artavazd Vanyan noted that, judging by the fact that there was a local outbreak, and not an epidemic, this seems unlikely.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic infection in which patients experience intoxication, fever, and lymph node involvement. The causative agent of the disease is _Francisella tularensis_. Some animals, including rabbits, hare and water rats are considered carriers of tularemia bacteria. Infection is transmitted to a person by direct contact with sick animals or through contaminated food and water. There are fewer cases of tularemia infection by aspiration - for example, when processing grain products, threshing bread, and sometimes there are cases of infection through blood-sucking arthropods.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED sincerely thanks the EpiCore members who were able to supply the original citation in Armenian and then translate it into a cogent form.

The oculoglandular form is one of the rarest forms. In this study, we evaluated tularemia patients, focusing on the ocular form and the efficacy of early antimicrobial therapy.\n\n\"Methodology: During a tularemia outbreak, the epidemiological and clinical findings, laboratory assays, and drugs used for the treatment of 48 patients were recorded prospectively. The diagnosis of tularemia was confirmed with microagglutination test (MAT) as well as clinical findings.\n\n\"Results: The mean age of the subject was 48.6 years; 23 (47.9 percent) of them were female. 36 (81.25 percent) patients had clinical presentation compatible with oropharyngeal tularemia, 7 (14.58 percent) with oculoglandular tularemia, and 2 (4.1 percent) with ulceroglandular tularemia. The most common symptoms were fever (91.6 percent) and sore throat (81.2 percent), and the most common findings were lymphadenopathy (91.6 percent) and tonsillopharyngitis (81.2 percent). In the oculoglandular form, fever, lymphadenopathy, periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis were found. The most distinctive ophthalmic feature was follicular conjunctivitis and conjunctival epithelial defects. A total of 45 cases had positive serological results with MAT. All the patients were treated with antimicrobials considered effective against _F. tularensis_, and topical antimicrobial treatment was given to the patients with oculoglandular tularemia. As many as 26 (54.16 percent) patients, who were admitted within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms, recovered without sequel.\n\n\"Conclusions: During tularemia outbreaks, ocular involvement should be considered carefully. The early administration of appropriate treatment will be more effective in resolving the infection and preventing complications. Along with systemic antimicrobial therapy, topical treatment will help recovery.\"\n\nAgain, ProMED would much appreciate any other suggestions regarding the translation. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/133.]\nSee Also\nTularemia - Armenia: (TV) RFI 20171002.5355480\n2016\n----\nTularemia - Ukraine: (KR) 20160204.3995341\n2015\n----\nTularemia, animal - Czech Republic: (MO) hare 20150523.3380738\nTularemia - Kosovo (02) 20150216.3170249\nTularemia - Kosovo: RFI 20150212.3161852\n2013\n----\nTularemia - Russia (02): (KM) 20130919.1954010\nTularemia - Russia: (KM) 20130825.1898671\n2012\n----\nTularemia - Russia (02): (KX) susp.

A Mesa County couple called health officials after finding the rabbit on their property. \"We've lived out here for over 20 years,\" said [CW]. \"We have a lot of coyotes, bobcats different things, badgers are out here.\"\n\nHealth officials said they have discovered rabbit fever in neighborhoods east and west of the Colorado National Monument.\n\n\"This particular rabbit like to go underneath my car; he hung out there most of the day. One day I came out here and he was dead,\" said [W]. \"I bagged it up and took it to the health department, so they examined it and they called me a couple days later saying it was positive for the rabbit disease.\"\n\nHomeowners who see multiple animals on their properties should call Mesa County Public Health right away, as it could be a sign of unusual disease activity in the area. \"In the last few years, we've seen an uptick in detecting it in wildlife and in people,\" explained Thomas Orr, an epidemiologist with Mesa County Public Health. \"We really want to get the message out so people don't get ill with this. If they do have sick pets or get sick themselves, it is treatable.\"\n\nBureau of Land Management spokesperson Chris Joyner said the disease is most common near the river. \"We've seen a lot of cases of Tularemia connected to the river corridors in our high use areas along the river. We have a lot recreation that takes place there,\" he said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said to use masks when mowing the lawn to reduce inhaling bacteria. Experts also suggest cooking game meat thoroughly before eating. Tularemia is treatable, according to health officials.

Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics; therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows symptoms of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\n\n- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.\n\n- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.\n\n- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.\n\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.\n\n- If you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps: Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits. Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165 degrees F or higher.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following information is quoted from \"Tularemia Surveillance\" (last modified on 24 Jul 2015) on the APHIS-USDA National Wildlife Disease Program (NWDP) website, available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/programs/SA_NWDP/CT_Tularemia.\n\n\"Tularemia has been identified as a disease of concern to human, wildlife and domestic animal populations within the United States. It, like plague, is considered a 'Category A' disease by the Department of Homeland Security, meaning it could potentially be used as a bioterrorist agent.\n\nLocation\nTularemia is found most often in the South-Central and Western US, mostly in rural areas. It is also found internationally, throughout the Northern Hemisphere in places like Japan, Russia and Scandinavia.\n\nDisease Agent\nTularemia is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.\n\nAffected Species\nTularemia mostly affects, and is reservoired within, a variety of mammals including (but not limited to) beavers, water voles, rabbits, hares, skunks and coyotes.\n\nThe disease is not contagious from human to human, but can be spread by the bites of fleas, ticks and other arthropods that have fed on infected wildlife, or by contact with the carcass of the infected animal. Reported human cases of tularemia in the United States currently average about 200 yearly, a dramatic reduction from the over 1000 cases per year that occurred in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nNWDP Activities\nNWDP biologists and their collaborators are currently sampling aquatic rodents and other susceptible species across the US to detect the presence of tularemia antibodies in their blood. Due to the focus on early detection, local health professionals can be alerted when tularemia is present in a region and take this into consideration when examining certain symptoms.\n\nIn humans, tularemia 1st emerges as a flu-like illness. Depending on the method of exposure to the bacterium, infected individuals may also experience lesions, swollen lymph glands and even the development of pneumonia.

A 2nd cat has been diagnosed with the infectious disease.\n\nTularemia, also known as \"rabbit fever,\" is a naturally occurring disease found in wildlife, specifically in rabbits, squirrels, and rodents. People and animals can get the disease from fly or tick bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nThe disease is rare in Minnesota. So far this year [2016], 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metro area. Usually, zero to 5 animal cases happen annually.\n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk. Infected cats often have a high fever, mouth ulcers and loss of appetite.\n\nPeople who have had contact with animals like wild rabbits and are showing these symptoms should contact their doctor and Minnesota Department of Health.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16848. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Alaska: canine, lagomorph (hare)\nDate: Sat 28 May 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/alaska-reports-tularemia-in-sick-hares-48103/\n\n\nA sick hare with signs of tularemia was killed by a North Pole [suburb of Fairbanks] resident on [11 May 2016]. The disease was present based on observations during a necropsy performed today [28 May 2016] by ADF&G [Alaska Department of Fish and Game] wildlife veterinarian, Dr Kimberlee Beckmen. In addition, a Fairbanks veterinarian reported a suspected case of tularemia in a dog from the Chena Hot Springs area last week. The dog was found eating a hare 2 days prior to becoming severely ill with fever.\n\n\"Outbreaks of tularemia in dogs and cats that come in contact with sick hares occur in the Fairbanks North Star Borough every May and June,\" said Dr Beckmen, \"but this year's [2016] cases are about 2 weeks earlier than usual\". Tularemia is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in the Interior between Memorial Day [last Monday in May] and Labor Day [first Monday in September] because it is spread by ticks which are active during the summer.\n\nLast summer [2015], a North Pole man became ill after skinning an infected hare. In 2015, Colorado saw the largest outbreak in state history with 11 human cases in May alone and New Mexico also documented a significant outbreak of human cases.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. 2 species of dog ticks have become established around urban areas in Alaska and are also capable of spreading the disease.\n\nWhile tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare. Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\n\"Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Do not allow your pets to roam free or have access to sick hares. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,\" said Dr Beckmen.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth. Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. Double-bag and dispose of dead hares in the trash or bury where dogs and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alaska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nIt seems a bit early for the tularemia season. This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the francisella life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. -

Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. -

A 2nd cat has been diagnosed with the infectious disease.\n\nTularemia, also known as \"rabbit fever,\" is a naturally occurring disease found in wildlife, specifically in rabbits, squirrels, and rodents. People and animals can get the disease from fly or tick bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nThe disease is rare in Minnesota. So far this year [2016], 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metro area. Usually, zero to 5 animal cases happen annually.\n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk. Infected cats often have a high fever, mouth ulcers and loss of appetite.\n\nPeople who have had contact with animals like wild rabbits and are showing these symptoms should contact their doctor and Minnesota Department of Health.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16848. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Alaska: canine, lagomorph (hare)\nDate: Sat 28 May 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/alaska-reports-tularemia-in-sick-hares-48103/\n\n\nA sick hare with signs of tularemia was killed by a North Pole [suburb of Fairbanks] resident on [11 May 2016]. The disease was present based on observations during a necropsy performed today [28 May 2016] by ADF&G [Alaska Department of Fish and Game] wildlife veterinarian, Dr Kimberlee Beckmen. In addition, a Fairbanks veterinarian reported a suspected case of tularemia in a dog from the Chena Hot Springs area last week. The dog was found eating a hare 2 days prior to becoming severely ill with fever.\n\n\"Outbreaks of tularemia in dogs and cats that come in contact with sick hares occur in the Fairbanks North Star Borough every May and June,\" said Dr Beckmen, \"but this year's [2016] cases are about 2 weeks earlier than usual\". Tularemia is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in the Interior between Memorial Day [last Monday in May] and Labor Day [first Monday in September] because it is spread by ticks which are active during the summer.\n\nLast summer [2015], a North Pole man became ill after skinning an infected hare. In 2015, Colorado saw the largest outbreak in state history with 11 human cases in May alone and New Mexico also documented a significant outbreak of human cases.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. 2 species of dog ticks have become established around urban areas in Alaska and are also capable of spreading the disease.\n\nWhile tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare. Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\n\"Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Do not allow your pets to roam free or have access to sick hares. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,\" said Dr Beckmen.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth. Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. Double-bag and dispose of dead hares in the trash or bury where dogs and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alaska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nIt seems a bit early for the tularemia season. This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the francisella life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods.

A 2nd cat has been diagnosed with the infectious disease.\n\nTularemia, also known as \"rabbit fever,\" is a naturally occurring disease found in wildlife, specifically in rabbits, squirrels, and rodents. People and animals can get the disease from fly or tick bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nThe disease is rare in Minnesota. So far this year [2016], 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metro area. Usually, zero to 5 animal cases happen annually.\n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk.

The disease was present based on observations during a necropsy performed today [28 May 2016] by ADF&G [Alaska Department of Fish and Game] wildlife veterinarian, Dr Kimberlee Beckmen. In addition, a Fairbanks veterinarian reported a suspected case of tularemia in a dog from the Chena Hot Springs area last week. The dog was found eating a hare 2 days prior to becoming severely ill with fever.\n\n\"Outbreaks of tularemia in dogs and cats that come in contact with sick hares occur in the Fairbanks North Star Borough every May and June,\" said Dr Beckmen, \"but this year's [2016] cases are about 2 weeks earlier than usual\". Tularemia is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in the Interior between Memorial Day [last Monday in May] and Labor Day [first Monday in September] because it is spread by ticks which are active during the summer.\n\nLast summer [2015], a North Pole man became ill after skinning an infected hare. In 2015, Colorado saw the largest outbreak in state history with 11 human cases in May alone and New Mexico also documented a significant outbreak of human cases.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. 2 species of dog ticks have become established around urban areas in Alaska and are also capable of spreading the disease.\n\nWhile tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare. Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\n\"Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Do not allow your pets to roam free or have access to sick hares. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,\" said Dr Beckmen.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth. Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. Double-bag and dispose of dead hares in the trash or bury where dogs and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alaska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nIt seems a bit early for the tularemia season. This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the francisella life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. -

It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska.

This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the francisella life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. -

If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. -

A 2nd cat has been diagnosed with the infectious disease.\n\nTularemia, also known as \"rabbit fever,\" is a naturally occurring disease found in wildlife, specifically in rabbits, squirrels, and rodents. People and animals can get the disease from fly or tick bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nThe disease is rare in Minnesota. So far this year [2016], 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metro area. Usually, zero to 5 animal cases happen annually.\n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk. Infected cats often have a high fever, mouth ulcers and loss of appetite.\n\nPeople who have had contact with animals like wild rabbits and are showing these symptoms should contact their doctor and Minnesota Department of Health.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16848. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Alaska: canine, lagomorph (hare)\nDate: Sat 28 May 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/alaska-reports-tularemia-in-sick-hares-48103/\n\n\nA sick hare with signs of tularemia was killed by a North Pole [suburb of Fairbanks] resident on [11 May 2016]. The disease was present based on observations during a necropsy performed today [28 May 2016] by ADF&G [Alaska Department of Fish and Game] wildlife veterinarian, Dr Kimberlee Beckmen. In addition, a Fairbanks veterinarian reported a suspected case of tularemia in a dog from the Chena Hot Springs area last week. The dog was found eating a hare 2 days prior to becoming severely ill with fever.\n\n\"Outbreaks of tularemia in dogs and cats that come in contact with sick hares occur in the Fairbanks North Star Borough every May and June,\" said Dr Beckmen, \"but this year's [2016] cases are about 2 weeks earlier than usual\". Tularemia is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in the Interior between Memorial Day [last Monday in May] and Labor Day [first Monday in September] because it is spread by ticks which are active during the summer.\n\nLast summer [2015], a North Pole man became ill after skinning an infected hare. In 2015, Colorado saw the largest outbreak in state history with 11 human cases in May alone and New Mexico also documented a significant outbreak of human cases.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. 2 species of dog ticks have become established around urban areas in Alaska and are also capable of spreading the disease.\n\nWhile tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare. Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\n\"Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Do not allow your pets to roam free or have access to sick hares. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,\" said Dr Beckmen.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth. Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. Double-bag and dispose of dead hares in the trash or bury where dogs and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alaska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nIt seems a bit early for the tularemia season. This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the francisella life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods.

A 2nd cat has been diagnosed with the infectious disease.\n\nTularemia, also known as \"rabbit fever,\" is a naturally occurring disease found in wildlife, specifically in rabbits, squirrels, and rodents. People and animals can get the disease from fly or tick bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nThe disease is rare in Minnesota. So far this year [2016], 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metro area. Usually, zero to 5 animal cases happen annually.\n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk. Infected cats often have a high fever, mouth ulcers and loss of appetite.\n\nPeople who have had contact with animals like wild rabbits and are showing these symptoms should contact their doctor and Minnesota Department of Health.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Minnesota can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16848. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Alaska: canine, lagomorph (hare)\nDate: Sat 28 May 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/alaska-reports-tularemia-in-sick-hares-48103/\n\n\nA sick hare with signs of tularemia was killed by a North Pole [suburb of Fairbanks] resident on [11 May 2016]. The disease was present based on observations during a necropsy performed today [28 May 2016] by ADF&G [Alaska Department of Fish and Game] wildlife veterinarian, Dr Kimberlee Beckmen. In addition, a Fairbanks veterinarian reported a suspected case of tularemia in a dog from the Chena Hot Springs area last week. The dog was found eating a hare 2 days prior to becoming severely ill with fever.\n\n\"Outbreaks of tularemia in dogs and cats that come in contact with sick hares occur in the Fairbanks North Star Borough every May and June,\" said Dr Beckmen, \"but this year's [2016] cases are about 2 weeks earlier than usual\". Tularemia is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in the Interior between Memorial Day [last Monday in May] and Labor Day [first Monday in September] because it is spread by ticks which are active during the summer.\n\nLast summer [2015], a North Pole man became ill after skinning an infected hare. In 2015, Colorado saw the largest outbreak in state history with 11 human cases in May alone and New Mexico also documented a significant outbreak of human cases.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. 2 species of dog ticks have become established around urban areas in Alaska and are also capable of spreading the disease.\n\nWhile tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare. Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\n\"Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Do not allow your pets to roam free or have access to sick hares. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,\" said Dr Beckmen.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth. Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. Double-bag and dispose of dead hares in the trash or bury where dogs and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alaska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nIt seems a bit early for the tularemia season. This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the francisella life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. - Mod.TG]\nSee Also\n2015\n---\nTularemia - USA (18) 20151205.3842058\nTularemia - USA (17): (WY, NE) 20150925.3670429\nTularemia - USA (16): (AZ) rabbits 20150830.3612365\nTularemia - USA (15): (CO) rabbits 20150828.3608721\nTularemia - USA (14): (WY) fatality 20150825.3599260\nTularemia - USA (13): (NM, WY, AZ) human, animal 20150819.3580618\nTularemia - USA (12): (AK) hare, human 20150818.3586385\nTularemia - USA (11): (WY) rabbit 20150802.3553047\nTularemia - USA (10): (CO, SD) 20150801.3548673\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) muskrat, alert 20150728.3542178\nTularemia - USA (08): (ND): human, animal 20150726.3537551\nTularemia - USA (07): (NM) 20150715.3510564\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit, alert 20150703.3482641\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) susp. 20150702.3480207\nTularemia - USA (04): (CO) rabbit, dog 20150702.3479571\nTularemia - USA (03): (CO) 20150626.3467769\nTularemia - USA (02): (CO) 20150603.3403896\nTularemia - USA: (CO) 20150522.3379806\n2014\n---\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) humans, beavers 20141206.3014671\nTularemia - USA (08): (CO) hunter warning 20141003.2829512\nTularemia - USA (07): (CO) 20140923.2798680\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) 20140918.2783744\nTularemia - USA (05): (CO) 20140912.2763100\nTularemia - USA (04): (IL, CO) fatal 20140813.2684686\nTularemia - USA (03): (CA) feline 20140711.2602339\nTularemia - USA (02): (NM) 20140711.2601188\nTularemia - USA: (CO) rabbit 20140705.2589884\n2013\n---\nTularemia - USA (08): 2001-2010 20131130.2083934\nTularemia - USA (07): (MA) 20130905.1926007\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit 20130818.1886594\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) snowshoe hare 20130702.1802498\n.................................................sb/tg/mj/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "tuberculosis", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-05-16 00:00:00", "2016-05-11 00:00:00", "2016-05-28 00:00:00", "2021-06-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-09-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Alaska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Fairbanks", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Minneapolis", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hot Springs", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "alaska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mod", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Montana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oklahoma", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Dakota", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3995341", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - Ukraine: (KR)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3995341", "date": "2015-08-28 15:41:04", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA (15): (COLORADO) RABBITS\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 27 Aug 2015\nSource: KKTV.com [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Rabbit--323158751.html\n\n\nMore rabbits have tested positive for rabbit fever, also known as tularemia. The rabbits didn't have contact with any people.\n[Apart from those who picked them up for testing. - Mod.JW]\n\nThey were found in the Pueblo West area on the following streets [i.e., in the city of Pueblo, in Pueblo County]:\nLinden Avenue\nKirkwood Drive\nSiesta Drive\nSpalding Avenue\nBeardsley Place.\n\nThe Pueblo Health Department says there have been widespread die-offs throughout Pueblo West. They're advising everyone in the area.\n\nRabbit fever is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by handling sick or dead animals what are infected. People can also get it if they are bitten by an infected insect.\n\nHere's important information the Pueblo County Health Department shared.\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics, therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows signs of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it.

It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has also been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from 1 life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/52400.htm. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3463.]\nSee Also\nTularemia - USA (14): (WY) fatality 20150825.3599260\nTularemia - USA (13): (NM, WY, AZ) human, animal 20150819.3580618\nTularemia - USA (12): (AK) hare, human 20150818.3586385\nTularemia - USA (11): (WY) rabbit 20150802.3553047\nTularemia - USA (10): (CO, SD) 20150801.3548673\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) muskrat, alert 20150728.3542178\nTularemia - USA (08): (ND): human, animal 20150726.3537551\nTularemia - USA (07): (NM) 20150715.3510564\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit, alert 20150703.3482641\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) susp. 20150702.3480207\nTularemia - USA (04): (CO) rabbit, dog 20150702.3479571\nTularemia - USA (03): (CO) 20150626.3467769\nTularemia - USA (02): (CO) 20150603.3403896\nTularemia - USA: (CO) 20150522.3379806\n2014\n----\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) humans, beavers 20141206.3014671\nTularemia - USA (08): (CO) hunter warning 20141003.2829512\nTularemia - USA (07): (CO) 20140923.2798680\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) 20140918.2783744\nTularemia - USA (05): (CO) 20140912.2763100\nTularemia - USA (04): (IL, CO) fatal 20140813.2684686\nTularemia - USA (03): (CA) feline 20140711.2602339\nTularemia - USA (02): (NM) 20140711.2601188\nTularemia - USA: (CO) rabbit 20140705.2589884\n2013\n----\nTularemia - USA (08): 2001-2010 20131130.2083934\nTularemia - USA (07): (MA) 20130905.1926007\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit 20130818.1886594\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) snowshoe hare 20130702.1802498\nTularemia - USA (04): (NE) 20130629.1798960\nTularemia - USA (03): (NM) human, feline, canine, alert 20130628.1797147\nTularemia - USA (02): (NE) 20130624.1789311\nTularemia - USA: (NC) hunters 20130226.1560910\n.................................................sb/tg/pg/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pueblo County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pueblo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3865365", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - Denmark: (HS) hare, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3865365", "date": "2015-08-28 15:41:04", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA (15): (COLORADO) RABBITS\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 27 Aug 2015\nSource: KKTV.com [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Rabbit--323158751.html\n\n\nMore rabbits have tested positive for rabbit fever, also known as tularemia.

Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/52400.htm. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3463.]\nSee Also\nTularemia - USA (14): (WY) fatality 20150825.3599260\nTularemia - USA (13): (NM, WY, AZ) human, animal 20150819.3580618\nTularemia - USA (12): (AK) hare, human 20150818.3586385\nTularemia - USA (11): (WY) rabbit 20150802.3553047\nTularemia - USA (10): (CO, SD) 20150801.3548673\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) muskrat, alert 20150728.3542178\nTularemia - USA (08): (ND): human, animal 20150726.3537551\nTularemia - USA (07): (NM) 20150715.3510564\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit, alert 20150703.3482641\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) susp. 20150702.3480207\nTularemia - USA (04): (CO) rabbit, dog 20150702.3479571\nTularemia - USA (03): (CO) 20150626.3467769\nTularemia - USA (02): (CO) 20150603.3403896\nTularemia - USA: (CO) 20150522.3379806\n2014\n----\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) humans, beavers 20141206.3014671\nTularemia - USA (08): (CO) hunter warning 20141003.2829512\nTularemia - USA (07): (CO) 20140923.2798680\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) 20140918.2783744\nTularemia - USA (05): (CO) 20140912.2763100\nTularemia - USA (04): (IL, CO) fatal 20140813.2684686\nTularemia - USA (03): (CA) feline 20140711.2602339\nTularemia - USA (02): (NM) 20140711.2601188\nTularemia - USA: (CO) rabbit 20140705.2589884\n2013\n----\nTularemia - USA (08): 2001-2010 20131130.2083934\nTularemia - USA (07): (MA) 20130905.1926007\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit 20130818.1886594\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) snowshoe hare 20130702.1802498\nTularemia - USA (04): (NE) 20130629.1798960\nTularemia - USA (03): (NM) human, feline, canine, alert 20130628.1797147\nTularemia - USA (02): (NE) 20130624.1789311\nTularemia - USA: (NC) hunters 20130226.1560910\n.................................................sb/tg/pg/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pueblo County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pueblo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3775022", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - Canada: (ON)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3775022", "date": "2015-08-28 15:41:04", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA (15): (COLORADO) RABBITS\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 27 Aug 2015\nSource: KKTV.com [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Rabbit--323158751.html\n\n\nMore rabbits have tested positive for rabbit fever, also known as tularemia.

Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics, therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows signs of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\n- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.\n- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.\n- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.\n\nIf you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps:\n- Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits.\n- Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165 deg F or higher.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has also been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form.

Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics, therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows signs of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\n- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.\n- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.\n- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.\n\nIf you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps:\n- Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits.\n- Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165 deg F or higher.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has also been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from 1 life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

The rabbits didn't have contact with any people.\n[Apart from those who picked them up for testing. - Mod.JW]\n\nThey were found in the Pueblo West area on the following streets [i.e., in the city of Pueblo, in Pueblo County]:\nLinden Avenue\nKirkwood Drive\nSiesta Drive\nSpalding Avenue\nBeardsley Place.\n\nThe Pueblo Health Department says there have been widespread die-offs throughout Pueblo West. They're advising everyone in the area.\n\nRabbit fever is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by handling sick or dead animals what are infected. People can also get it if they are bitten by an infected insect.\n\nHere's important information the Pueblo County Health Department shared.\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics, therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows signs of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\n- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.\n- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.\n- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.\n\nIf you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps:\n- Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits.\n- Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165 deg F or higher.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has also been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from 1 life stage (\"stadium\") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

According to their press release, tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease associated with various animal species. It frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs.\n\nHumans can be infected with the bacteria through many different sources including through the bite of an infected insect, usually a tick or deerfly, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or by inhalation of the bacteria. Tularemia is treatable with appropriate antimicrobials.\n\nSymptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure and can include a sudden high fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain and a sore or lesion at the site where the bacteria entered the body.\n\nTo avoid exposure to tularemia, the Scotts Bluff County Health Department encourages people to avoid handling sick or dead animals, wear rubber gloves when skinning or handling animals, cook meat thoroughly, use protective clothing and insect repellents to avoid deer-fly and tick bites, avoid untreated drinking water, and use DEET or other tick repellents during tick season.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Kern]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.\n\nTularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home.

According to their press release, tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease associated with various animal species. It frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs.\n\nHumans can be infected with the bacteria through many different sources including through the bite of an infected insect, usually a tick or deerfly, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or by inhalation of the bacteria. Tularemia is treatable with appropriate antimicrobials.\n\nSymptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure and can include a sudden high fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain and a sore or lesion at the site where the bacteria entered the body.\n\nTo avoid exposure to tularemia, the Scotts Bluff County Health Department encourages people to avoid handling sick or dead animals, wear rubber gloves when skinning or handling animals, cook meat thoroughly, use protective clothing and insect repellents to avoid deer-fly and tick bites, avoid untreated drinking water, and use DEET or other tick repellents during tick season.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Kern]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.\n\nTularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats.

According to their press release, tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease associated with various animal species. It frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs.\n\nHumans can be infected with the bacteria through many different sources including through the bite of an infected insect, usually a tick or deerfly, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or by inhalation of the bacteria. Tularemia is treatable with appropriate antimicrobials.\n\nSymptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure and can include a sudden high fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain and a sore or lesion at the site where the bacteria entered the body.\n\nTo avoid exposure to tularemia, the Scotts Bluff County Health Department encourages people to avoid handling sick or dead animals, wear rubber gloves when skinning or handling animals, cook meat thoroughly, use protective clothing and insect repellents to avoid deer-fly and tick bites, avoid untreated drinking water, and use DEET or other tick repellents during tick season.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Kern]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.\n\nTularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats.

The typical incubation period is 3-5 days, with a range of 1-14 days. - Mod.LL\n\nProMED HealthMaps:\nNebraska: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229,\nWyoming: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/251.]\nSee Also\nTularemia - USA (08): (WY) 20150718.3520085\nTularemia - USA (07): (NM) 20150715.3510564\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit, alert 20150703.3482641\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) susp. 20150702.3480207\nTularemia - USA (04): (CO) rabbit, dog 20150702.3479571\nTularemia - USA (03): (CO) 20150626.3467769\nTularemia - USA (02): (CO) 20150603.3403896\nTularemia - USA: (CO) 20150522.3379806\n2014\n----\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) humans, beavers 20141206.3014671\nTularemia - USA (08): (CO) hunter warning 20141003.2829512\nTularemia - USA (07): (CO) 20140923.2798680\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) 20140918.2783744\nTularemia - USA (05): (CO) 20140912.2763100\nTularemia - USA (04): (IL, CO) fatal 20140813.2684686\nTularemia - USA (03): (CA) feline 20140711.2602339\nTularemia - USA (02): (NM) 20140711.2601188\nTularemia - USA: (CO) rabbit 20140705.2589884\n2013\n----\nTularemia - USA (08): 2001-2010 20131130.2083934\nTularemia - USA (07): (MA) 20130905.1926007\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit 20130818.1886594\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) snowshoe hare 20130702.1802498\nTularemia - USA (04): (NE) 20130629.1798960\nTularemia - USA (03): (NM) human, feline, canine, alert 20130628.1797147\n.................................................sb/ll/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2002-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Wyoming", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3537025", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - USA (09): (NE, WY) alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3537025", "date": "2015-07-26 12:59:52", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA (09): (NEBRASKA, WYOMING), ALERT\n************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 21 Jul 2015\nSource: KOTA-TV [edited]\nhttp://www.kotatv.com/news/nebraska-news/sb-county-health-department-announces-an-increase-in-tularemia-cases/34279732\n\n\nThe Scotts Bluff County Health Department has been notified of a significant increase in positive tularemia cases in the county and eastern Wyoming over the past couple weeks. According to their press release, tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease associated with various animal species. It frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs.\n\nHumans can be infected with the bacteria through many different sources including through the bite of an infected insect, usually a tick or deerfly, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or by inhalation of the bacteria. Tularemia is treatable with appropriate antimicrobials.\n\nSymptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure and can include a sudden high fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain and a sore or lesion at the site where the bacteria entered the body.\n\nTo avoid exposure to tularemia, the Scotts Bluff County Health Department encourages people to avoid handling sick or dead animals, wear rubber gloves when skinning or handling animals, cook meat thoroughly, use protective clothing and insect repellents to avoid deer-fly and tick bites, avoid untreated drinking water, and use DEET or other tick repellents during tick season.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Kern]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.\n\nTularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3-5 days, with a range of 1-14 days. - Mod.LL\n\nProMED HealthMaps:\nNebraska: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229,\nWyoming: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/251.]\nSee Also\nTularemia - USA (08): (WY) 20150718.3520085\nTularemia - USA (07): (NM) 20150715.3510564\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit, alert 20150703.3482641\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) susp. 20150702.3480207\nTularemia - USA (04): (CO) rabbit, dog 20150702.3479571\nTularemia - USA (03): (CO) 20150626.3467769\nTularemia - USA (02): (CO) 20150603.3403896\nTularemia - USA: (CO) 20150522.3379806\n2014\n----\nTularemia - USA (09): (CO) humans, beavers 20141206.3014671\nTularemia - USA (08): (CO) hunter warning 20141003.2829512\nTularemia - USA (07): (CO) 20140923.2798680\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) 20140918.2783744\nTularemia - USA (05): (CO) 20140912.2763100\nTularemia - USA (04): (IL, CO) fatal 20140813.2684686\nTularemia - USA (03): (CA) feline 20140711.2602339\nTularemia - USA (02): (NM) 20140711.2601188\nTularemia - USA: (CO) rabbit 20140705.2589884\n2013\n----\nTularemia - USA (08): 2001-2010 20131130.2083934\nTularemia - USA (07): (MA) 20130905.1926007\nTularemia - USA (06): (CO) rabbit 20130818.1886594\nTularemia - USA (05): (AK) snowshoe hare 20130702.1802498\nTularemia - USA (04): (NE) 20130629.1798960\nTularemia - USA (03): (NM) human, feline, canine, alert 20130628.1797147\n.................................................sb/ll/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2002-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Wyoming", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WY", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3520085", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - USA (08): (WY)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3520085", "date": "2015-06-03 04:39:45", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA (02): (COLORADO)\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 28 May 2015\nSource: The Denver Channel [edited]\nhttp://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/health/tularemia-patient-in-lafayette-dies-of-other-medical-complications\n\n\nFollowing increased reports of tularemia over the past few years, a patient who recently contracted the disease while gardening has died of other medical complications.

Boulder County Public Health spokeswoman Chana Goussetis said the Lafayette resident tested positive for tularemia after developing symptoms of high fever, headache, and general malaise. It is believed the patient contracted the illness while mowing and gardening.\n\nWhile this person was the 1st to test positive for tularemia in Boulder County in 2015, the county health department says 3 other cases were reported elsewhere in Colorado. All were associated with people who had recently been gardening or landscaping. Seven animals have also tested positive for the disease in 2015.\n\n\"People become infected with tularemia through skin contact with infected animal tissue or through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies,\" Goussetis said. \"The bacteria can also be inhaled when infected animal tissue is broken up into small particles and spread in the air, such as when an infected carcass is mowed over.\" In 2014, 16 people tested positive for the disease in Colorado, Goussetis said. Five of those were residents of Boulder County.\n\n\"Symptoms of tularemia include an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, difficulty breathing, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure,\" Goussetis said. \"Symptoms also include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea, or pneumonia. Tularemia is treatable when detected early.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter.

He's believed to have been exposed to tularemia at a family picnic after he was bitten by a tick. He was taken to Children's Hospital with a high fever and put on antibiotics. \"It [the temperature] got higher and higher so I took him in to the ER and once I got there they basically told me, 'Your baby's really sick and he's not leaving.

There are usually only 4 cases a year in Colorado but that has quadrupled in 2014 because heavy rain has fueled vegetation and given rabbits more places to live. \"As long as we continue to see warm temperatures and also these animals are around, then we may see that disease still,\" said Chilton.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209.

He was taken to Children's Hospital with a high fever and put on antibiotics. \"It [the temperature] got higher and higher so I took him in to the ER and once I got there they basically told me, 'Your baby's really sick and he's not leaving.

He was taken to Children's Hospital with a high fever and put on antibiotics. \"It [the temperature] got higher and higher so I took him in to the ER and once I got there they basically told me, 'Your baby's really sick and he's not leaving.

The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, 0.2-0.5 micrometre x 0.7-1.0 micrometre, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 degrees C. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.\n\nTwo types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.\n\nThe disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism. For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2012, Chapter 2.1.18 \"Tularemia\" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_TULAREMIA.pdf\n(adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).\n\nOIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to tularemia are spelled out in chapter 8.15 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.15.htm.\n\nAccording to the most recent 6-month OIE report, tularemia was reported as present in 6 countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, and Switzerland). In addition, Spain and the United States have reported the disease limited to certain zones. In 82 countries the disease has never been reported, and in 40 the disease was reported absent in this period. On the other hand, most countries have not specified surveillance for tularemia, some maintain \"general surveillance\" and very few maintain \"targeted surveillance\" countries (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).\n\nA map showing the distribution of disease in domestic and/or wild species can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseasedistributionmap. (Note: at both WAHID links, to view the information on tularemia, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).\n\nAlthough Tularemia had not been reported in the Netherlands since 1953, this event should not come as a surprise since the disease is present in the surrounding countries such as Germany, France and Belgium. The Dutch province of Limburg is situated in south Netherlands, bordering Germany and Belgium. The Dutch source \"Groene Ruimte\", cited at the end of the commentary, says: \"The bacterium has been recently demonstrated in 3 percent of hares found dead in northern Germany.

The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, 0.2-0.5 micrometre x 0.7-1.0 micrometre, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 degrees C. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.\n\nTwo types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.\n\nThe disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism. For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2012, Chapter 2.1.18 \"Tularemia\" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_TULAREMIA.pdf\n(adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).\n\nOIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to tularemia are spelled out in chapter 8.15 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.15.htm.\n\nAccording to the most recent 6-month OIE report, tularemia was reported as present in 6 countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, and Switzerland). In addition, Spain and the United States have reported the disease limited to certain zones. In 82 countries the disease has never been reported, and in 40 the disease was reported absent in this period. On the other hand, most countries have not specified surveillance for tularemia, some maintain \"general surveillance\" and very few maintain \"targeted surveillance\" countries (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).\n\nA map showing the distribution of disease in domestic and/or wild species can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseasedistributionmap. (Note: at both WAHID links, to view the information on tularemia, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).\n\nAlthough Tularemia had not been reported in the Netherlands since 1953, this event should not come as a surprise since the disease is present in the surrounding countries such as Germany, France and Belgium. The Dutch province of Limburg is situated in south Netherlands, bordering Germany and Belgium. The Dutch source \"Groene Ruimte\", cited at the end of the commentary, says: \"The bacterium has been recently demonstrated in 3 percent of hares found dead in northern Germany.

The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, 0.2-0.5 micrometre x 0.7-1.0 micrometre, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 degrees C. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.\n\nTwo types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.\n\nThe disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism.

In addition, Spain and the United States have reported the disease limited to certain zones. In 82 countries the disease has never been reported, and in 40 the disease was reported absent in this period.

It also has raised questions about the impact of drought, overpopulation and habitat destruction on wildlife. Officials say there are no reports of human illness.\n\nWhat is known for sure is that 7 of the beavers that thrived in and along McCullough Creek in the park died in the last year [2012]. The cause is less certain.\n\n\"There is no conclusive evidence,\" researcher Nohra Mateus-Pinilla said, \"but it appears that the only thing that could have caused the die-off is an outbreak of tularemia.\" She emphasized that tularemia bacteria are common. \"They are present in rabbits and squirrels,\" she said. \"They are part of the natural ecosystem.\"\n\nMateus-Pinilla, a wildlife veterinary epidemiologist at the Illinois Natural History Survey, said it is possible that severe drought exacerbated the outbreak, with low water levels forcing beavers and other animals to live in closer quarters. Continuing destruction of wildlife habitat has a similar effect, she said.\n\nDerek Liebert, project manager at the Urbana Park District, said a wildlife biologist suggested to him that if tularemia is in fact the cause, the die-off may be a corrective measure for a population that grew too large.\n\nThe Champaign-Urbana Public Health District issued an alert notifying residents of tularemia in the area. The alert cited a Meadowbrook beaver diagnosed with clinical symptoms of tularemia and an unrelated 2011 outbreak among 5 pet cats in Champaign, Urbana and Savoy.\n\nHealth district planning director Awais Vaid said people should not let their pets roam and should take them to a veterinarian if they exhibit symptoms such as loss of appetite or difficulty with movement. People who see sick animals in the wild or along trails should not approach them, Vaid said, not only because of the risk of tularemia but of rabies.\n\nThe park district warns Meadowbrook users to keep pets leashed and to stay on trails in the park. Mateus-Pinilla reinforced local government warnings about allowing domestic animals to roam or run unleashed.\n\n\"Then you are bringing them into your house, where there is direct contact. That is more serious,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, tularemia is common among wild rodents and can be transmitted to other animals and humans through direct contact and by ticks, biting flies and other insects. In humans, tularemia bacteria can cause illness ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening.\n\nLiebert said the 1st dead beaver was found in January 2012. It was taken to the University of Illinois veterinary diagnostic laboratory, where tests were conducted, with inconclusive results. Then in June and September, 2 adult beavers were found dead but were too decomposed to be necropsied, he said.\n\nThe biggest spate of deaths occurred in October [2012], when 3 beavers were found, 2 of which were necropsied. In November, a 7th beaver was found. Liebert said the most recent sighting of a live beaver, a single individual, occurred 19 Dec 2012.\n\nThe effort to isolate the cause of the deaths was hampered by several circumstances, Mateus-Pinilla said. One is that decomposition sets in rapidly, and sometimes there is not much a pathologist can do because of the condition of the body. The \"gold standard\" for a confirmed diagnosis, Mateus-Pinilla said, is the ability to grow a culture of the suspect bacteria. The Meadowbrook beavers were tested for several pathogens, including tularemia, salmonella, leptospira and canine distemper. No tests resulted positive.\n\nHowever, investigators were able to rule out toxins, such as from run-off, and also found evidence pointing to tularemia, even if it did not amount to a confirmed diagnosis.\n\nMateus-Pinilla said salmonella and leptospira were eliminated, for example, because salmonella would not have caused a die-off, and leptospira is associated with lesions not found in the necropsies. But investigators did find certain changes in the lungs typical of tularemia. In the end, Mateus-Pinilla said, what signs there were pointed to tularemia.\n\nMateus-Pinilla said it is unlikely that the habitat provided by the park itself was to blame. Indeed, she said, the fact that beavers were thriving there \"tells us it was a suitable habitat.\" Unfortunately, she said, the die-off \"also tells us that natural habitats are more and more disturbed, forcing the beavers to be in a more dense population.\"\n\nHuman attraction to nature puts people in closer contact with wildlife diseases, she added. \"We want to put our house in the woods,\" and as a result \"we are getting closer to diseases that we wouldn't find in the middle of New York City.\"\n\nMateus-Pinilla sees an opportunity for independent research through close monitoring of future colonies at Meadowbrook.\n\n\"I would love to see it happening,\" she said. The Meadowbrook beavers are \"close to one of the biggest wildlife research institutions in the United States. We have the resources, and we have the students.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is caused by the gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.

Liebert said the most recent sighting of a live beaver, a single individual, occurred 19 Dec 2012.\n\nThe effort to isolate the cause of the deaths was hampered by several circumstances, Mateus-Pinilla said. One is that decomposition sets in rapidly, and sometimes there is not much a pathologist can do because of the condition of the body. The \"gold standard\" for a confirmed diagnosis, Mateus-Pinilla said, is the ability to grow a culture of the suspect bacteria. The Meadowbrook beavers were tested for several pathogens, including tularemia, salmonella, leptospira and canine distemper. No tests resulted positive.\n\nHowever, investigators were able to rule out toxins, such as from run-off, and also found evidence pointing to tularemia, even if it did not amount to a confirmed diagnosis.\n\nMateus-Pinilla said salmonella and leptospira were eliminated, for example, because salmonella would not have caused a die-off, and leptospira is associated with lesions not found in the necropsies. But investigators did find certain changes in the lungs typical of tularemia. In the end, Mateus-Pinilla said, what signs there were pointed to tularemia.\n\nMateus-Pinilla said it is unlikely that the habitat provided by the park itself was to blame. Indeed, she said, the fact that beavers were thriving there \"tells us it was a suitable habitat.\" Unfortunately, she said, the die-off \"also tells us that natural habitats are more and more disturbed, forcing the beavers to be in a more dense population.\"\n\nHuman attraction to nature puts people in closer contact with wildlife diseases, she added. \"We want to put our house in the woods,\" and as a result \"we are getting closer to diseases that we wouldn't find in the middle of New York City.\"\n\nMateus-Pinilla sees an opportunity for independent research through close monitoring of future colonies at Meadowbrook.\n\n\"I would love to see it happening,\" she said.

Both developed the ulcero-glandular\nform of tularemia, with ulceration at the site of the injury and\nprominent lymphadenitis. The 1st case recovered after a complicated\ncourse, the 2nd is improving on treatment.\n\nThe microbiological collaboration between the Royal Hobart Hospital\nand Westmead Hospital laboratories has been crucial. Both diagnoses\nwere supported by positive DFA [direct fluorescent-antibody assay] on\nexcised or aspirated tissues. PCR-based characterization of genetic\nmaterial from the 1st case suggested the strain of _Francisella\ntularensis_ involved was _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_\nbiovar _japonica_.\n\nTherefore, the clinical and microbiological evidence to date points to\nthese zoonotic infections (and possible epizootic) being due to one of\nthe relatively less virulent strains of _F. tularensis_, that is, not\nthe type A or subspecies _tularensis_ strain more often associated\nwith serious sepsis such as pneumonia and septicemia in parts of the\nnorthern hemisphere. The recent Tasmanian cases also appear to be\ndifferent from the case acquired in the NT a decade ago (_F.\nnovicida_).\n\nPublic health actions so far have included information to animal\nhandlers who might work in the area of the 1st case, wider public\nadvice around wild animal contact via the media, and alerts to\nclinicians and laboratories. The extent of the risk-area for this\ninfection within Tasmania is unclear, but based on these recent cases,\nmay be relatively restricted. We will also address the possibility of\nrisk from water, by reiterating existing guidance around protecting\nprivate water supplies from microbial hazards, and rendering raw water\nsafe by boiling it. We are engaging with our Department of Primary\nIndustry, Parks, Wildlife and the Environment around further\ninvestigations. These have begun.\n\nWe would like to pass the following points on to infectious disease\nphysicians, microbiologists, and their colleagues who may not\npreviously have considered the possibility of tularemia acquired in\nthe Southern Hemisphere.\n\nClinical features that raise the possibility of Tasmanian-acquired _F.\ntularensis_ infection include\n- an animal bite or scratch or close exposure to wild animals or their\nenvironment, particularly in the region of the West Coast of Tasmania;\n- persistent local soft tissue infection at the inoculation site and\nregional lymphadenitis, which may suppurate;\n- disease progression, or a poor response, with beta-lactam antibiotic\ntherapy.\n\n_F. tularensis_ is a major laboratory hazard; clinical specimens must\nbe managed by a laboratory with PC3 [physical containment level 3]\nfacilities.\n\n--\nDr Mark Veitch\nTasmanian Department of Health and Human Services\nTasmania, Australia\n<mark.veitch@dhhs.tas.gov.au>\nand\nDr Louise Cooley\nRoyal Hobart Hospital\nTasmania, Australia\n<louise.cooley@dhhs.tas.gov.au>\n\n[ProMED-mail sincerely thanks Dr Veitch and Dr Cooley for supplying\nvital information regarding the clinical circumstances and\nmicrobiological data regarding these 2 separate cases of\nulceroglandular tularemia acquired from possums in Tasmania.

Both cases were women in\ntheir 40s, each bitten and/or scratched by separate possums (probably\njuvenile and probably ill) at points only a few kilometers apart along\na remote road in western Tasmania. Both developed the ulcero-glandular\nform of tularemia, with ulceration at the site of the injury and\nprominent lymphadenitis. The 1st case recovered after a complicated\ncourse, the 2nd is improving on treatment.\n\nThe microbiological collaboration between the Royal Hobart Hospital\nand Westmead Hospital laboratories has been crucial. Both diagnoses\nwere supported by positive DFA [direct fluorescent-antibody assay] on\nexcised or aspirated tissues. PCR-based characterization of genetic\nmaterial from the 1st case suggested the strain of _Francisella\ntularensis_ involved was _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_\nbiovar _japonica_.\n\nTherefore, the clinical and microbiological evidence to date points to\nthese zoonotic infections (and possible epizootic) being due to one of\nthe relatively less virulent strains of _F. tularensis_, that is, not\nthe type A or subspecies _tularensis_ strain more often associated\nwith serious sepsis such as pneumonia and septicemia in parts of the\nnorthern hemisphere. The recent Tasmanian cases also appear to be\ndifferent from the case acquired in the NT a decade ago (_F.\nnovicida_).\n\nPublic health actions so far have included information to animal\nhandlers who might work in the area of the 1st case, wider public\nadvice around wild animal contact via the media, and alerts to\nclinicians and laboratories. The extent of the risk-area for this\ninfection within Tasmania is unclear, but based on these recent cases,\nmay be relatively restricted. We will also address the possibility of\nrisk from water, by reiterating existing guidance around protecting\nprivate water supplies from microbial hazards, and rendering raw water\nsafe by boiling it. We are engaging with our Department of Primary\nIndustry, Parks, Wildlife and the Environment around further\ninvestigations.

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89\nyears). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An\nincreased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to\ncontamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\n>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)\nof tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28\ncases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in\ncentral Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had\nclinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water\nfrom the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella\ntularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described\nbelow. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,\ninvolving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one\ncommon source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from\nother parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89\nyears). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An\nincreased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to\ncontamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\n>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)\nof tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28\ncases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in\ncentral Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had\nclinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water\nfrom the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella\ntularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described\nbelow. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,\ninvolving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one\ncommon source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from\nother parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream.

The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89\nyears). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An\nincreased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to\ncontamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\n>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)\nof tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28\ncases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in\ncentral Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had\nclinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water\nfrom the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella\ntularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described\nbelow. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,\ninvolving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one\ncommon source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from\nother parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89\nyears). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An\nincreased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to\ncontamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\n>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)\nof tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28\ncases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in\ncentral Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had\nclinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water\nfrom the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella\ntularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described\nbelow. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,\ninvolving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one\ncommon source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from\nother parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89\nyears). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An\nincreased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to\ncontamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\n>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)\nof tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28\ncases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in\ncentral Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had\nclinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water\nfrom the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella\ntularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described\nbelow. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,\ninvolving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one\ncommon source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from\nother parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The mean age was 40.3 years (range 2-89\nyears). 34 reported use of drinking water from private wells. An\nincreased rodent (lemming) population and snow melting may have led to\ncontamination of the wells with infected rodents or rodent excreta.\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\n>From 1 Jan to 25 Mar 2011, 39 confirmed cases (16 female and 23 male)\nof tularemia were reported from the counties of Sor-Trondelag (28\ncases), More og Romsdal (5 cases), and Nord-Trondelag (6 cases) in\ncentral Norway. A confirmed case was defined as a person who had\nclinical symptoms compatible with tularemia or had used drinking water\nfrom the same source as a previous case, and in whom _Francisella\ntularensis_ infection was confirmed by a laboratory test as described\nbelow. The cases were geographically scattered within each county,\ninvolving 13 different municipalities, and were not linked to one\ncommon source. In comparison, 7 cases were reported in total from\nother parts of the country in the same period. In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

It's unclear how the Fairbanks\nresidents contracted it.\n\nBeckmen says people are usually infected through the skin by handling sick\nhares, but they can also get it when bitten by ticks, flies, or mosquitoes\nthat fed on sick hares.\n\nA Fish and Game spokeswoman says the Fairbanks patients were treated with\nantibiotics and are doing well.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as\nvoles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found\nin a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at\nlow temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter.\nAlthough hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be\ninfected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are\nimportant in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of\nmechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks,\ndeerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food\nor water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will\ndictate the form of the disease manifestation with cutaneous exposures\nusually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of\ndisease in these Alaskan cases is not stated.\n\nProMED-mail posted an alert (20041008.2760, see below) in October 2004\nregarding hamsters from a Canadian pet distributor that were found to be\ninfected with type B tularemia as well.

Self-treatment had no success.\n\nIn the hospital his illness was suspected as tularemia and the\ndiagnosis was confirmed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is endemic, not emerging, in the region, but is reported here\nbecause it is listed as a Schedule A potential bioterror agent. There\nis, of course, no suggestion that this case was due to bioterrorism.\nSee images of a case at:\n<http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn12960/dn12960-1_500.jpg>\n& of the causative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ at:\n<http://www.lcusd.net/lchs/mewoldsen/Image15.jpg>\n- Mod.JW\n\nPeriodically tularemia is observed in the European part of Russia.\nThe most significant outbreak was recorded in 2005 in the Nizhny\nNovgorod, Voronezh, Moscow, and Vladimir regions. In total 334 people\nwere hospitalized with symptoms of tularemia. The disease was\nlaboratory confirmed in 128 cases -- see ProMED refs. below. - Mod.NP\n\nThe glandular (or ulceroglandular if an ulcer was present distally)\ntularemia may have been acquired from an exposure to a [wild] animal\n[such as a rabbit or hare] during his vacation, from [contaminated]\nwater, or via an arthropod bite.\n\nThe Moscow area can be found on a map at:\n<http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9909/14/moscow.explosion.03/russia.moscow.lg.jpg>\n- Mod.LL]\nSee Also\n2007\n----\nTularemia, hunter - Russia: (Amur) 20071207.3946\nTularemia - Russia (Khanti-Mansiysky)(03) 20070910.2988\nTularemia - Russia (Khanti-Mansiysky) 20070826.2804\nTularemia - Armenia (Gegarkuniq) (02) 20070316.0918\nTularemia - Armenia (Gegarkuniq) 20070314.0901\nTularemia, potable water - Georgia (Kaspskiy) (02) 20070127.0362\nTularemia, potable water - Georgia (Kaspskiy) 20070124.0317\n2005\n----\nTularemia - Russia (European) 20050831.2577\nTularemia - Russia (Nizhniy Novgorod) 20050824.2503\nTularemia - Russia (Ryazan) (02) 20050822.2467\nTularemia - Russia (Ryazan) 20050718.2066\nTularemia, hunters - Russia (Stavropol) 20050322.0825\nTularemia - Ukraine (Donetsk) 20050304.0663\n.........................ba/np/ll/ejp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

While they are still awaiting lab\nconfirmation of the diagnosis, officials issued an advisory to avoid\ncontracting the infectious bacterium, which commonly causes fever and\nswollen lymph nodes. A treatable infection, tularemia usually spreads\nthrough tick and deerfly bites, but it also can be contracted through\nmosquitoes or by direct contact with an infected animal. Outdoor\nenthusiasts are advised to wear long, light-colored pants tucked into\nboots or socks and long-sleeved shirts, stay on marked trails, avoid\nwalking in tall grasses, use repellents containing DEET and avoid\ndirect contact with wild animals including their feces and carcasses.\nHealth officials advise those who believe they have infected bug\nbites to contact their physician or local health departments and\nmention tularemia. Treatments for the infection are different from\nthat typically used for skin infections.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Although the clinical manifestations in campers in the Utah outbreak\nare not described, they must have been characteristic enough of\ntularemia to warrant a presumptive diagnosis, pending laboratory\nconfirmation. Fever, chills, drenching sweats, muscle aches, malaise,\nnausea, vomiting, and weight loss usually appear 3 to 5 days after\nexposure to _Francisella tularensis_, but can take as long as 14\ndays. Other manifestations usually are specific for the mode of\ntransmission. For example, open painful sores develop where the\nbacteria entered the skin at the site of a scratch or abrasion,\nusually on the hands and fingers of hunters, or in the groin, axilla,\nand trunk in tick or deer fly-associated cases, accompanied by\nswollen, painful regional lymphadenopathy. A sore, inflamed throat\nand cervical swollen lymph nodes follow ingestion of undercooked\ninfected meat or contaminated water; abdominal pain, nausea,\nvomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally intestinal bleeding with swollen\nabdominal lymph nodes may also occur. Pneumonia may follow inhalation\nof infectious aerosols. Inhalation of an infectious aerosol is\nbelieved to be the mode of transmission if _F. tularensis_ were to be\nused as a bioweapon. A typhoidal type involves chills, high fever,\nand abdominal pain due to blood stream infection with _F. tularensis_\nin the absence of an ulcer or swollen lymph nodes. The animal source\nis usually an infected rodent or rabbit. Diagnosis is usually made on\nthe basis of positive cultures of blood or other infected material or\nserology.\nTularemia is usually treated with gentamicin or streptomycin for 7 to\n14 days, although other antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g.,\nciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or tetracyclines (minocyclne and\ndoxycycline) are also effective. If untreated, the overall death rate\nis 5-15 percent; less than one percent of appropriately treated\npatients die.\nUtah Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake in the state of Utah\n(see map of Utah at\n<http://www.enchantedlearning.com/usa/states/utah/>).\nWe await further reports from the Utah Department of Health on this\noutbreak. - Mod.ML]\n******\n[2] New Jersey\nDate: Sat 14 Jul 2007\nSource: Capemaycountyherald.com [edited]\n<http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/6917-tick-borne-illness-strikes-county-teenager>\n\nThe Cape May County Department of Health was notified on 12 Jul 2007\nthat a 14-year-old county resident has contracted tularemia, also\nknown as \"rabbit fever.\"\nTularemia is a rare, potentially serious illness caused by the\nbacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which occurs widely in nature and\ncan affect animals, particularly rodents and rabbits. Tularemia can\nbe acquired in multiple ways: such as being bitten by an infected\ntick; handling infected animal carcasses; eating or drinking\ncontaminated food or water; or inhaling the bacteria. The signs and\nsymptoms people develop depend on how they are exposed to tularemia.\nPossible symptoms include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph\nglands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or\npneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include abrupt\nonset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry\ncough, and progressive weakness. Tularemia can be fatal if the person\nis not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\nTo minimize risk of infection, Kevin Thomas, health officer, advises\nresidents \"to cook food thoroughly and to drink water from a safe\nsource, use a DEET-containing insect repellent on the skin, and avoid\nhandling\nanimal carcasses. If contact with animal carcasses cannot be avoided,\npersons should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly with soap and\nwater after removing gloves.\"\nFewer than 200 cases of tularemia are reported annually in the United\nStates, mainly in western and south central states. The last reported\nNew Jersey tularemia case occurred in September 2004 in a 31-year-old\nCape May County resident with extensive outdoor exposure history.\nNJDHSS is working closely with the New Jersey Department of\nEnvironmental Protection's (NJDEP) Division of Fish and Wildlife,\nwhich has not identified unusual animal die-off activity in the state\nto date.\nThe American dog tick and the Lone star tick, both found in Cape May\nCounty, are known to carry tularemia. To protect against all\ntick-borne disease, residents should follow these guidelines when\noutside with known ticks: Wear light-colored, tightly woven clothing\nto make it easier to spot ticks; tuck shirts into pants and pants\ninto socks; wear closed shoes/sneakers rather than open sandals. Use\na tick repellent as directed. Products should contain DEET (for\nclothing or skin) or Permethrin (for clothing only). Remind children\nto ask an adult to apply the tick repellent and do not apply to hands\nor face. Use products with less than 10 percent DEET, and always\nfollow manufacturers' directions carefully. Do not use repellents on\nchildren under 3 years of age. While outside, stay in the center of\ntrails, avoid low bushes and leafy brush, periodically check clothing\nand skin for ticks and remove. Once inside, check clothing, skin, and\nhair for ticks (take special note of a child's navel, underarm, groin\narea and behind the ears). If a tick is found, remove it carefully\nwith tweezers.\nInformation on tularemia is available at\n<http://www.state.nj.us/health/er/tularemia.shtml>,\nand information on tick-borne disease at\n<http://www.cmchealth.net>.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[The instructions on use of DEET in the news release above are\nsomewhat confusing. DEET, a broad-spectrum insect repellant, should\nbe applied to exposed, unbroken skin of adults and children, avoiding\nthe eyes and mouth (see\n<http://www.deet.com/content/htm/child.html>).\nThis is done by adults applying DEET to their hands and then\nspreading over exposed areas of the face and body of themselves and\nchildren. Do not allow children to apply the product themselves. Do\nnot apply to open wounds and scratches, and do not apply to the hands\nof small children, since they frequently put their hands into their\nmouths. Never spray DEET onto anyone's face, as it can cause eye\nirritation.\nThe higher the DEET concentration, the longer the hours of protection\nagainst insect bites, although concentrations exceeding about 30\npercent DEET offer little additional advantage. While several lower\nconcentrations of DEET formulations (20 percent-34 percent) offer 3-6\nhours of protection, an extended-release preparation of 35 percent\nDEET offers up to 12 hours of protection, (see\n<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics found no difference in safety for\nchildren between products containing 10 percent and 30 percent DEET\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm>)\nwhen used as directed but is said to recommend that repellents used\non children should contain no more than 10 percent DEET\n(<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).\nThe insect repellent products that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus,\nnot DEET, should not be used on children less than 3 years of age.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that repellents with\nDEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months old.\nDEET also can be applied to clothing made of natural fibers and nylon\nbut may destroy other synthetic fibers and plastic (such as eyeglass\nframes and watch crystals).

For example, open painful sores develop where the\nbacteria entered the skin at the site of a scratch or abrasion,\nusually on the hands and fingers of hunters, or in the groin, axilla,\nand trunk in tick or deer fly-associated cases, accompanied by\nswollen, painful regional lymphadenopathy. A sore, inflamed throat\nand cervical swollen lymph nodes follow ingestion of undercooked\ninfected meat or contaminated water; abdominal pain, nausea,\nvomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally intestinal bleeding with swollen\nabdominal lymph nodes may also occur. Pneumonia may follow inhalation\nof infectious aerosols. Inhalation of an infectious aerosol is\nbelieved to be the mode of transmission if _F. tularensis_ were to be\nused as a bioweapon. A typhoidal type involves chills, high fever,\nand abdominal pain due to blood stream infection with _F. tularensis_\nin the absence of an ulcer or swollen lymph nodes. The animal source\nis usually an infected rodent or rabbit. Diagnosis is usually made on\nthe basis of positive cultures of blood or other infected material or\nserology.\nTularemia is usually treated with gentamicin or streptomycin for 7 to\n14 days, although other antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g.,\nciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or tetracyclines (minocyclne and\ndoxycycline) are also effective.

Tularemia can\nbe acquired in multiple ways: such as being bitten by an infected\ntick; handling infected animal carcasses; eating or drinking\ncontaminated food or water; or inhaling the bacteria. The signs and\nsymptoms people develop depend on how they are exposed to tularemia.\nPossible symptoms include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph\nglands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or\npneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include abrupt\nonset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry\ncough, and progressive weakness. Tularemia can be fatal if the person\nis not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\nTo minimize risk of infection, Kevin Thomas, health officer, advises\nresidents \"to cook food thoroughly and to drink water from a safe\nsource, use a DEET-containing insect repellent on the skin, and avoid\nhandling\nanimal carcasses. If contact with animal carcasses cannot be avoided,\npersons should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly with soap and\nwater after removing gloves.\"\nFewer than 200 cases of tularemia are reported annually in the United\nStates, mainly in western and south central states. The last reported\nNew Jersey tularemia case occurred in September 2004 in a 31-year-old\nCape May County resident with extensive outdoor exposure history.\nNJDHSS is working closely with the New Jersey Department of\nEnvironmental Protection's (NJDEP) Division of Fish and Wildlife,\nwhich has not identified unusual animal die-off activity in the state\nto date.\nThe American dog tick and the Lone star tick, both found in Cape May\nCounty, are known to carry tularemia. To protect against all\ntick-borne disease, residents should follow these guidelines when\noutside with known ticks: Wear light-colored, tightly woven clothing\nto make it easier to spot ticks; tuck shirts into pants and pants\ninto socks; wear closed shoes/sneakers rather than open sandals. Use\na tick repellent as directed. Products should contain DEET (for\nclothing or skin) or Permethrin (for clothing only). Remind children\nto ask an adult to apply the tick repellent and do not apply to hands\nor face. Use products with less than 10 percent DEET, and always\nfollow manufacturers' directions carefully. Do not use repellents on\nchildren under 3 years of age. While outside, stay in the center of\ntrails, avoid low bushes and leafy brush, periodically check clothing\nand skin for ticks and remove. Once inside, check clothing, skin, and\nhair for ticks (take special note of a child's navel, underarm, groin\narea and behind the ears). If a tick is found, remove it carefully\nwith tweezers.\nInformation on tularemia is available at\n<http://www.state.nj.us/health/er/tularemia.shtml>,\nand information on tick-borne disease at\n<http://www.cmchealth.net>.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[The instructions on use of DEET in the news release above are\nsomewhat confusing. DEET, a broad-spectrum insect repellant, should\nbe applied to exposed, unbroken skin of adults and children, avoiding\nthe eyes and mouth (see\n<http://www.deet.com/content/htm/child.html>).\nThis is done by adults applying DEET to their hands and then\nspreading over exposed areas of the face and body of themselves and\nchildren. Do not allow children to apply the product themselves. Do\nnot apply to open wounds and scratches, and do not apply to the hands\nof small children, since they frequently put their hands into their\nmouths. Never spray DEET onto anyone's face, as it can cause eye\nirritation.\nThe higher the DEET concentration, the longer the hours of protection\nagainst insect bites, although concentrations exceeding about 30\npercent DEET offer little additional advantage. While several lower\nconcentrations of DEET formulations (20 percent-34 percent) offer 3-6\nhours of protection, an extended-release preparation of 35 percent\nDEET offers up to 12 hours of protection, (see\n<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics found no difference in safety for\nchildren between products containing 10 percent and 30 percent DEET\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm>)\nwhen used as directed but is said to recommend that repellents used\non children should contain no more than 10 percent DEET\n(<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).\nThe insect repellent products that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus,\nnot DEET, should not be used on children less than 3 years of age.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that repellents with\nDEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months old.\nDEET also can be applied to clothing made of natural fibers and nylon\nbut may destroy other synthetic fibers and plastic (such as eyeglass\nframes and watch crystals).

Tularemia can\nbe acquired in multiple ways: such as being bitten by an infected\ntick; handling infected animal carcasses; eating or drinking\ncontaminated food or water; or inhaling the bacteria. The signs and\nsymptoms people develop depend on how they are exposed to tularemia.\nPossible symptoms include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph\nglands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or\npneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include abrupt\nonset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry\ncough, and progressive weakness. Tularemia can be fatal if the person\nis not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\nTo minimize risk of infection, Kevin Thomas, health officer, advises\nresidents \"to cook food thoroughly and to drink water from a safe\nsource, use a DEET-containing insect repellent on the skin, and avoid\nhandling\nanimal carcasses. If contact with animal carcasses cannot be avoided,\npersons should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly with soap and\nwater after removing gloves.\"\nFewer than 200 cases of tularemia are reported annually in the United\nStates, mainly in western and south central states.

To protect against all\ntick-borne disease, residents should follow these guidelines when\noutside with known ticks: Wear light-colored, tightly woven clothing\nto make it easier to spot ticks; tuck shirts into pants and pants\ninto socks; wear closed shoes/sneakers rather than open sandals. Use\na tick repellent as directed. Products should contain DEET (for\nclothing or skin) or Permethrin (for clothing only). Remind children\nto ask an adult to apply the tick repellent and do not apply to hands\nor face. Use products with less than 10 percent DEET, and always\nfollow manufacturers' directions carefully. Do not use repellents on\nchildren under 3 years of age. While outside, stay in the center of\ntrails, avoid low bushes and leafy brush, periodically check clothing\nand skin for ticks and remove. Once inside, check clothing, skin, and\nhair for ticks (take special note of a child's navel, underarm, groin\narea and behind the ears).

Has the\napparent secondary increase in sick hares, i.e. after the human cases, any\nepidemiological explanation other than merely improved observation. -\nMod.MHJ\n......................................mhj/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
