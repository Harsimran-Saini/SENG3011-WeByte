Most cases of illness are reported from central Sweden (the Dalarna region, Gavleborg and Orebro), but an increasing number of reports are also starting to come in from other regions, especially in northern Sweden.\n\nSince the number of illness cases is usually highest in September in Sweden, the outbreak is expected to grow further in the coming weeks.\n\nInfections in Sweden are mainly seen in forest and field hares and rodents, but the disease has been reported in several other species, including other mammals, birds, amphibians, insects, and ticks.\n\nTularemia, or harpest as it is known as in Sweden, is one of the most common native zoonoses in people in Sweden. People are infected mainly through mosquitoes, but also through direct contact with sick or dead animals and by inhalation of, for example, infectious dust.\n\nThe number of reported cases of harpest in humans varies from year to year, in recent years there have been reported between about 100 to over 800 cases per year. More than 90 percent of reported human cases have fallen ill in Sweden.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak, primarily in central Sweden, continues to increase in size.\n\n_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.\n\nTularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ naturally infects several mammalian wildlife species in northern Europe, in particular, mice, rabbits, hares, beavers, voles, lemmings, and muskrats. The ticks _Dermacentor reticularis_ and _Ixodes ricinus_ are vectors for the bacterium, although previous research has suggested that mosquito bites are the most frequent route of transmission to humans in Sweden.\n\nIn addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread via contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe manifestations of infection in this growing outbreak in parts of Sweden are not stated. If vector borne, the most common form would be ulceroglandular with an ulcer at the introduction site and enlarged lymph nodes in that area. If waterborne, oropharyngeal would be most common. Among flying vectors, deer flies are often brought up but mosquitoes are also relevant as shown in this Swedish publication:\n\nReference\n---------\nThelaus J, Andersson A, Broman T, et al: _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ occurs in Swedish mosquitoes, persists through the developmental stages of laboratory-infected mosquitoes and is transmissible during blood feeding. Microb Ecol. 2014; 67(1): 96-107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907667/\n\n'Abstract\n--------\nIn Sweden, mosquitoes are considered the major vectors of the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_, which causes tularemia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether mosquitoes acquire the bacterium as aquatic larvae and transmit the disease as adults. Mosquitoes sampled in a Swedish area where tularemia is endemic (Orebro) were positive for the presence of _F. tularensis_ deoxyribonucleic acid throughout the summer. Presence of the clinically relevant _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was confirmed in 11 out of the 14 mosquito species sampled. Experiments performed using laboratory-reared _Aedes aegypti_ confirmed that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was transstadially maintained from orally infected larvae to adult mosquitoes and that 25% of the adults exposed as larvae were positive for the presence of _F. tularensis_-specific sequences for at least 2 weeks. In addition, we found that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was transmitted to 58% of the adult mosquitoes feeding on diseased mice. In a small-scale in vivo transmission experiment with _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_-positive adult mosquitoes and susceptible mice, none of the animals developed tularemia. However, we confirmed that there was transmission of the bacterium to blood vials by mosquitoes that had been exposed to the bacterium in the larval stage. Taken together, these results provide evidence that mosquitoes play a role in disease transmission in part of Sweden where tularemia recurs.'\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Sweden: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/108]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \nThelaus J, Andersson A, Broman T, et al: _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ occurs in Swedish mosquitoes, persists through the developmental stages of laboratory-infected mosquitoes and is transmissible during blood feeding.

The animal was found along the 4900 block of 95th Street, according to Boulder County health officials.\n\nTularemia is caused by the bacteria _Francisella tularensis_ and is typically found in animals, especially rabbits, rodents, and hares.\n\nSymptoms in humans include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, and more. Symptoms can also include abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and more.\n\nTularemia can be treated when detected in early stages, officials said.\n\nPeople can become infected with tularemia through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies, or through skin contact with infected animal tissue. Bacteria can also be inhaled when an infected animal is broken into small particles and spread through the air, such as when an infected carcass is mowed over.\n\n'It's always important to avoid contact with wild animals because of the risk of many diseases,' said Lane Drager, Boulder County Public Health Consumer Protection Program coordinator, in a statement. 'Although tularemia is rare, it is still a risk, especially considering the number of wild rabbits in our communities.'\n\nFive people in Colorado have been diagnosed with tularemia in 2019. So far, 3 rabbits have been tested positive in the state.\n\nOfficials said no residents have come into contact with the animal in Lafayette, but a resident's dog did. Officials said the resident took appropriate measures when collecting the rabbit.\n\nPublic officials recommend the following precautions:\n- Stay out of areas inhabited by wild rabbits and rodents. If you must enter areas frequented by wild animals, always wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Prevent your pets from hunting or eating wild rodents or rabbits.\n- Avoid all contact with wild rabbits and rodents, including squirrels; do not feed or handle them.\n- Never touch sick or dead animals with your bare hands. If an animal must be moved, place it in a garbage bag using a long-handled shovel, and place the bag in an outdoor garbage can.\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes; keep your pets from doing the same.\n- Don't mow over animal carcasses, and consider using a dust mask when doing landscape work.\n- Avoid ticks. The best protection for pets, especially cats, is to keep them indoors. If outdoors with pets, keep them out of heavily wooded areas, which are ideal habitats for ticks.\n- See a healthcare provider if you become ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.\n- Contact a veterinarian if your pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.\n\nFor more information about tularemia, visit http://cdc.gov/tularemia or http://boco.org/Tularemia.

Symptoms of infection vary depending on the route of entry. Usual sources of infection are described below. Transmission of tularemia from person to person has not been reported.\n\nFrom the CDC Tularemia webpage:\n\nSigns and symptoms\nThe signs and symptoms of tularemia vary depending on how the bacteria enter the body. Illness ranges from mild to life-threatening. All forms are accompanied by fever, which can be as high as 104 deg F/ 40 deg C. Main forms of this disease are listed below:\n\n- Ulceroglandular: This is the most common form of tularemia and usually occurs following a tick or deer fly bite or after handing of an infected animal. A skin ulcer appears at the site where the bacteria entered the body. The ulcer is accompanied by swelling of regional lymph glands, usually in the armpit or groin.\n- Glandular: Similar to ulceroglandular tularemia but without an ulcer. Also generally acquired through the bite of an infected tick or deer fly or from handling sick or dead animals.\n- Oculoglandular: This form occurs when the bacteria enter through the eye. This can occur when a person is butchering an infected animal and touches his or her eyes. Symptoms include irritation and inflammation of the eye and swelling of lymph glands in front of the ear.\n- Oropharyngeal: This form results from eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Patients with oropharyngeal tularemia may have sore throat, mouth ulcers, tonsillitis, and swelling of lymph glands in the neck.\n- Pneumonic: This is the most serious form of tularemia. Symptoms include cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. This form results from breathing dusts or aerosols containing the organism. It can also occur when other forms of tularemia (e.g., ulceroglandular) are left untreated and the bacteria spread through the bloodstream to the lungs.\n- Typhoidal: This form is characterized by any combination of the general symptoms (without the localizing symptoms of other syndromes).\n\nTularemia can be difficult to diagnose. It is a rare disease, and the symptoms can be mistaken for other, more common, illnesses. For this reason, it is important to share with your healthcare provider any likely exposures, such as tick and deer fly bites or contact with sick or dead animals.\n\nBlood tests and cultures can help confirm the diagnosis. Antibiotics used to treat tularemia include streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. Treatment usually lasts 10-21 days depending on the stage of illness and the medication used. Although symptoms may last for several weeks, most patients completely recover.\n\n_Francisella tularensis_ is highly infectious when grown in culture, and laboratory-acquired infections have been documented. The isolation of _F. tularensis_ from clinical specimens, especially if unanticipated, can generate concern among laboratory workers about possible exposure.\n\nManagement options for potentially exposed workers include a 'fever watch' or antimicrobial prophylaxis. During a fever watch, workers monitor their temperature with instructions to seek immediate treatment for tularemia if they develop a fever (usually defined as a single oral temperature above 101 deg F or 38.5 deg C).\n\nThere are no set criteria for determining who should be managed by fever watch and who would benefit from immediate prophylaxis.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/\n\nColorado health officials have recorded 11 human cases of tularemia since May2015, putting the state on pace for one of the most widespread years for the disease in more than 2 decades.\n\nIn 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recorded 16 human cases, representing the 2nd-highest number of cases since 1983, when there were 20.\nhttps://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/24/colorado-health-officials-tularemia-cases-on-record-breaking-pace/\n\nSo while we may not know the number for this year [2019], 3 in a short period of time clearly indicates we need to be aware of situations representing potential exposure. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nLafayette, Colorado, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34735]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nFrom the CDC Tularemia webpage:\n\nSigns and symptoms\n \n\nPeople can become infected with tularemia through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies, or through skin contact with infected animal tissue.

Large outbreak of tularaemia, central Sweden, July to September 2019. Euro Surveill. 2019; 24(42): pii=1900603. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.42.1900603.\n\nIn 2019, Sweden is experiencing its largest outbreak of tularemia in over 50 years. The outbreak started in July [2019], and as at 6 Oct 2019, a total of 979 cases have been reported. Here, we report the demographic features of cases and geographical distribution of the outbreak. We also provide evidence that the predominant route of transmission is via mosquito bites and want to make visitors aware of risks in endemic areas.\n\nIdentification of the outbreak\n-----------------------\nIn the last week of July 2019, the county medical officer (CMO) of Gavleborg county, central Sweden, received information from healthcare providers about an increasing number of people visiting healthcare centers with fever and presenting swollen inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. By 31 Jul 2019, there were 18 reported cases of tularemia; all were residents of or visitors to a small town in the county, Ljusdal. According to healthcare providers in Ljusdal, a majority had spent time near a lake and a golf course adjacent to the town. As a major golf competition with visitors from all over Sweden had been held between 23 and 27 Jul 2019, the CMO issued a press release on 31 Jul 2019 announcing the outbreak and put information on the Swedish national healthcare website (1177 Vardguiden) to alert healthcare in regions not used to diagnosing the disease. On 2 Aug 2019, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) published a news item about a suspected outbreak of tularemia among hares (_Lepus_ species), as a large number of dead hares had been detected and that tularemia had been identified in hares from several locations around Sweden.\n\nDuring the 1st week of August 2019, an unusually large number of human tularemia cases were reported to the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS) from other locations, mainly in neighboring counties to Gavleborg in central Sweden. On 12 Aug 2019, the PHAS published a news item on its website about the outbreak. At that time, the number of reported tularemia cases had reached over 80 in the county of Dalarna, where a major cycling competition with more than 20 000 national and international participants was taking place between 10 and 16 Aug 2019. A case definition for tularemia was as follows:\n\nTularemia case definition, Sweden\n---------------------------\nFor a confirmed case, at least one of the following 3:\n- Isolation of _Francisella tularensis_;\n- Detection of _Francisella tularensis_ nucleic acid; or\n- _Francisella tularensis_-specific antibody response\n\nFor a probable case, both of the following 2:\n- Clinical picture compatible with tularemia; and\n- Epidemiological link\n\nDescriptive epidemiology\n-----------------\nAs at week 40 2019 (6 Oct 2019), a total of 979 tularemia cases were reported to PHAS, 98% of which were registered since 24 Jul 2019, over 4 times more than the average number for the corresponding periods between 2000 and 2018 (Figure 1 [For figures and tables, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Of the reported cases, 734 were laboratory confirmed mainly based on serology (n\u2009=\u2009404) or PCR (n\u2009=\u2009285).\n\nBetween 1 Jan and 6 Oct each year during the period 2000-2018, 4422 tularemia cases were reported, of which 2557 (58%) were male and 1865 (42%) were female, with median ages of 50 years for both sexes. A significantly larger proportion of females above the age of 50 years were infected with tularemia in 2019 compared with the period between 2000 and 2018 (chi-squared test: p less than 0.001). For 752 of 979 tularemia cases in 2019, a specific municipality could be designated as the probable place of infection based on the information given in clinical reports. Fifteen municipalities reported 10 or more cases, and 13 were located in central Sweden. In 2 municipalities, over 100 cases were reported (Figure 3).\n\nDalarna county was the most affected by the tularemia outbreak and, according to reports from healthcare centers, 268 of 326 cases (82%) had the ulceroglandular form of tularemia; information was missing for 58 cases. A similar dominance of ulceroglandular tularemia has also been reported from local healthcare centres in Gavleborg county with patients having inflamed and sometimes infected mosquito bites. There have also been 4 reports of pneumonic cases. Of 979 tularemia cases reported nationally until 6 Oct 2019, 719 (73%) had a cause of infection specified as insect bites, which is higher than the corresponding period 2000-2018 (2729/4422 cases; 62%).\n\nEnvironmental investigation and findings in wildlife\n---------------------------------------------------\nMosquitoes were collected around the golf course in Ljusdal on 15 and 16 Aug 2019. A total of 550 mosquitoes were trapped, and of those, 373 (68%) belonged to the known tularemia vector _Aedes cinereus_ (Table 1). All other species found, except _Culiseta morsitans_, have previously been shown to be implicated in tularemia transmission [1]. Mosquitoes were divided into species pools based on their trapping location; in total, there were 24 pools. Molecular analyses showed that one of 8 pools of _Aedes cinereus_ containing 103 specimens that were collected near the tee to hole 14 and known to be a particularly mosquito-infested area among golfers tested positive for _Francisella tularensis holarctica_.\n\nIn Sweden, dead hares are routinely collected and analyzed by the SVA [2]. In 2019, 54 dead hares with tularemia were collected, while the mean annual number of dead hares with tularemia between 2007 and 2018 was 9 (Figure 4).\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n------------------------\nTularemia is caused by the highly contagious bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which can infect humans as well as more than 250 animal species [3]. Tularemia is widely spread throughout the northern hemisphere, and cases have been reported from all European countries except Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom [4]. From some parts of Sweden and Finland, where tularemia occurs endemically, the highest incidence in Europe is reported [5].\n\nSweden has reported cases of endemic tularemia since 1931 [6]. There has always been a variation in the number of human cases between different years, ranging from 0 cases in 1990 to 2700 cases in 1967. During the 2000s, the number of reported cases varied from 26 in 2001 to 859 in 2015, with a resulting incidence of 0.29 and 8.72 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively. However, no cyclical patterns or general trends were observed (personal communication Pontus Jureen, PHAS, 30 Sep 2019). The number of reported tularemia cases thus far in 2019 is higher than what has been reported in any single year since the end of the 1960s, and it is more than is reported from the whole of Europe during a normal year [4].\n\nHistorically, more males were reported with tularemia infection than females, with the age group 40-69 years most affected for both sexes; this pattern is seen in outbreak years as well years with a low number of reported infections (data not shown). This may be a reflection of the age distribution of people in rural areas working outdoors, e.g., doing farm and garden work [7]. In the current outbreak, a larger proportion of women aged 50 years and older has been observed, but the reasons for this deviating pattern is unknown. It is possible, for example, that with 2019 being a good mushroom year, more women in this age group were attracted to tularemia-risk areas to pick mushrooms.\n\nEver since the 1st tularemia cases were reported in 1931 until the early 1990s, the endemic area was in the northern part of central Sweden and extended along the Gulf of Bothnia [8]. Since the end of the 1990s, the geographical distribution of cases has expanded with a spread both to the west and towards the southern parts of central Sweden [9]. This expanded area has since remained endemic for tularemia and experienced larger outbreaks in its northern part in 2012 and 2015, in its central part in 2010, and in its southern part in 2000 and 2003. An expansion of the endemic area further south is not unlikely in the future, supported by the numerous dead hares with tularemia detected up to September 2019 by SVA, where at least 8 had been found in Gotaland located south of the endemic area [10].\n\nTularemia can be transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors, direct contact with infected animals, or by inhalation of contaminated dust. Due to the mode of transmission, different clinical forms are distinguished. In neighboring Norway and elsewhere in Europe, ingestion of contaminated water from streams, ponds, lakes, and rivers is the main mode of infection [4,11]. In Sweden, however, most cases are infected by mosquito bites, but transmission by ticks and rain flies also occurs [12]. Typically, mosquito-transmitted ulceroglandular tularemia starts to become evident late July or August, reaching a peak at the end of August or in September before declining up to December. Large mosquito populations are a risk factor for outbreaks of tularemia [13]. In this outbreak, the time of onset of symptoms in cases, e.g., reports of ulceroglandular tularemia plus inflamed or infected mosquito bites, suggests that the predominant mode of transmission was via mosquitoes. This is supported by the detection of _Francisella tularensis_ in the mosquito species _Aedes cinereus_ near the golf course in Ljusdal. The weather conditions in 2019, with a relatively wet spring and a mild summer and autumn, may have resulted in a favorable year for mosquito populations, meaning that transmission of tularemia between mosquitoes and their host animals may have been longer and more favorable than normal. However, it was not possible to investigate this further, as mosquito densities in high-risk areas are not monitored, nor are the populations of potential animal hosts. Interestingly, however, the outbreaks of tularemia in central Sweden in 2003 and 2010 and in northern Sweden in 2012 and 2015 were all preceded by wetter springs than normal in the high-risk areas.\n\nAs at 14 Oct 2019, the number of new cases of tularemia has dropped drastically, returning to average seasonal levels for the previous 3 weeks. However, due to the unusually high number of cases concentrated to areas with large numbers of external visitors, the 2019 tularemia outbreak has prompted intense communication between local and central authorities and attracted a great deal of media attention in Sweden. With this rapid communication, we aim to raise awareness for the risk of contracting tularemia through mosquito bites in endemic areas in Sweden and to raise awareness regarding protective measures such as wearing covering clothing and use of insect repellent. We also aim to raise awareness of tularemia among healthcare providers in non-endemic areas, as they may encounter patients who have acquired tularemia infection visiting high-risk areas such as in central and northern Sweden.\n\nReferences\n-----------\n1.

The number of reported tularemia cases thus far in 2019 is higher than what has been reported in any single year since the end of the 1960s, and it is more than is reported from the whole of Europe during a normal year [4]. A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Of 979 tularemia cases reported nationally until 6 Oct 2019, 719 (73%) had a cause of infection specified as insect bites, which is higher than the corresponding period 2000-2018 (2729/4422 cases; 62%). On 2 Aug 2019, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) published a news item about a suspected outbreak of tularemia among hares (_Lepus_ species), as a large number of dead hares had been detected and that tularemia had been identified in hares from several locations around Sweden. However, due to the unusually high number of cases concentrated to areas with large numbers of external visitors, the 2019 tularemia outbreak has prompted intense communication between local and central authorities and attracted a great deal of media attention in Sweden. In 2019, 54 dead hares with tularemia were collected, while the mean annual number of dead hares with tularemia between 2007 and 2018 was 9 (Figure 4). At that time, the number of reported tularemia cases had reached over 80 in the county of Dalarna, where a major cycling competition with more than 20 000 national and international participants was taking place between 10 and 16 Aug 2019. During the 1st week of August 2019, an unusually large number of human tularemia cases were reported to the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS) from other locations, mainly in neighboring counties to Gavleborg in central Sweden. We also aim to raise awareness of tularemia among healthcare providers in non-endemic areas, as they may encounter patients who have acquired tularemia infection visiting high-risk areas such as in central and northern Sweden. Historically, more males were reported with tularemia infection than females, with the age group 40-69 years most affected for both sexes; this pattern is seen in outbreak years as well years with a low number of reported infections (data not shown).

Large outbreak of tularaemia, central Sweden, July to September 2019. \n\nBetween 1 Jan and 6 Oct each year during the period 2000-2018, 4422 tularemia cases were reported, of which 2557 (58%) were male and 1865 (42%) The outbreak started in July [2019], and as at 6 Oct 2019, a total of 979 cases have been reported. In this outbreak, the time of onset of symptoms in cases, e.g., reports of ulceroglandular tularemia plus inflamed or infected mosquito bites, suggests that the predominant mode of transmission was via mosquitoes. By 31 Jul 2019, there were 18 reported cases of tularemia; all were residents of or visitors to a small town in the county, Ljusdal. An expansion of the endemic area further south is not unlikely in the future, supported by the numerous dead hares with tularemia detected up to September 2019 by SVA, where at least 8 had been found in Gotaland located south of the endemic area [10]. For 752 of 979 tularemia cases in 2019, a specific municipality could be designated as the probable place of infection based on the information given in clinical reports. Ever since the 1st tularemia cases were reported in 1931 until the early 1990s, the endemic area was in the northern part of central Sweden and extended along the Gulf of Bothnia [8]. As at 14 Oct 2019, the number of new cases of tularemia has dropped drastically, returning to average seasonal levels for the previous 3 weeks. As a major golf competition with visitors from all over Sweden had been held between 23 and 27 Jul 2019, the CMO issued a press release on 31 Jul 2019 announcing the outbreak and put information on the Swedish national healthcare website (1177 Vardguiden) to alert healthcare in regions not used to diagnosing the disease. \n\nSweden has reported cases of endemic tularemia since 1931 [6]. The weather conditions in 2019, with a relatively wet spring and a mild summer and autumn, may have resulted in a favorable year for mosquito populations, meaning that transmission of tularemia between mosquitoes and their host animals may have been longer and more favorable than normal. A significantly larger proportion of females above the age of 50 years were infected with tularemia in 2019 compared with the period between 2000 and 2018 (chi-squared test: p less than 0.001). There has always been a variation in the number of human cases between different years, ranging from 0 cases in 1990 to 2700 cases in 1967. A similar dominance of ulceroglandular tularemia has also been reported from local healthcare centres in Gavleborg county with patients having inflamed and sometimes infected mosquito bites. During the 2000s, the number of reported cases varied from 26 in 2001 to 859 in 2015, with a resulting incidence of 0.29 and 8.72 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively. ------------------------\nTularemia is caused by the highly contagious bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which can infect humans as well as more than 250 animal species [3]. It is possible, for example, that with 2019 being a good mushroom year, more women in this age group were attracted to tularemia-risk areas to pick mushrooms. With this rapid communication, we aim to raise awareness for the risk of contracting tularemia through mosquito bites in endemic areas in Sweden and to raise awareness regarding protective measures such as wearing covering clothing and use of insect repellent. In the last week of July 2019, the county medical officer (CMO) of Gavleborg county, central Sweden, received information from healthcare providers about an increasing number of people visiting healthcare centers with fever and presenting swollen inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. Tularemia is widely spread throughout the northern hemisphere, and cases have been reported from all European countries except Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom [4]. In 2019, Sweden is experiencing its largest outbreak of tularemia in over 50 years. This expanded area has since remained endemic for tularemia and experienced larger outbreaks in its northern part in 2012 and 2015, in its central part in 2010, and in its southern part in 2000 and 2003. Interestingly, however, the outbreaks of tularemia in central Sweden in 2003 and 2010 and in northern Sweden in 2012 and 2015 were all preceded by wetter springs than normal in the high-risk areas. TULAREMIA - SWEDEN (07): EUROSURVEILLANCE REPORT\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\nTularemia can be transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors, direct contact with infected animals, or by inhalation of contaminated dust. Of the reported cases, 734 were laboratory confirmed mainly based on serology (n\u2009=\u2009404) or PCR (n\u2009=\u2009285). \n\nIdentification of the outbreak\n Date: Thu 17 Oct 2019\n Fifteen municipalities reported 10 or more cases, and 13 were located in central Sweden. Large mosquito populations are a risk factor for outbreaks of tularemia [13]. From some parts of Sweden and Finland, where tularemia occurs endemically, the highest incidence in Europe is reported [5]. LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nSweden: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/108] In Sweden, however, most cases are infected by mosquito bites, but transmission by ticks and rain flies also occurs [12]. Typically, mosquito-transmitted ulceroglandular tularemia starts to become evident late July or August, reaching a peak at the end of August or in September before declining up to December. \n\nEnvironmental investigation and findings in wildlife\n In 2 municipalities, over 100 cases were reported (Figure 3). A total of 550 mosquitoes were trapped, and of those, 373 (68%) belonged to the known tularemia vector _Aedes cinereus_ (Table 1). Since the end of the 1990s, the geographical distribution of cases has expanded with a spread both to the west and towards the southern parts of central Sweden [9]. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Eurosurveillance report nicely summarizes this large outbreak of _F. tularensis_, primarily spread through infected mosquitoes.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2019-08-02 00:00:00", "2019-08-12 00:00:00", "2021-07-25 00:00:00", "1967-03-25 00:00:00", "2019-10-14 00:00:00", "2021-09-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-12-25 00:00:00", "1865-03-25 00:00:00", "2019-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "2000-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-08-25 00:00:00", "1440-02-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "1931-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2001-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "1177-03-25 00:00:00", "2019-09-30 00:00:00", "1990-03-25 00:00:00", "2019-09-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "1996-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-10-09 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "1992-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "2018-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "eurosurveillance", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dalarna county", "country": "Sweden"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Forsman M", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gotaland", "country": "Sweden"}, {"location": "Iceland", "country": "Iceland"}, {"location": "Ljusdal", "country": "Sweden"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "Ireland"}, {"location": "Finland", "country": "Finland"}, {"location": "Karta", "country": "Georgia"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Sweden", "country": "Sweden"}, {"location": "Dalarna", "country": "Sweden"}, {"location": "Norway", "country": "Norway"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6622351", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - Sweden (02): alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6622351", "date": "2019-08-14 14:12:01", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - SWEDEN (02): ALERT\n******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 12 Aug 2019 16:01 CEST +02:00\nSource: The Local [edited]\nhttps://www.thelocal.se/20190812/rabbit-fever-hundreds-infected-as-outbreak-grows-in-sweden\n\n\nSwedish health authorities have warned an outbreak of rabbit fever (tularemia) is expected to grow, with hundreds of people affected so far.\n\nA total of 212 confirmed cases have been reported to The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhallsomyndigheten) so far in 2019, sharply increasing from late July 2019. That is twice as many as in a normal year.\n\nBut Sweden has not yet seen the end of it, the authority warned on [Mon 12 Aug 2019]. 'Since the number of cases (of rabbit fever) is usually at its highest in September, the outbreak is expected to grow further in the coming weeks,' it wrote in a statement.\n\nMost cases have been reported in Dalarna, Gavleborg, and Orebro counties in central Sweden, but in the past week Vasterbotten and Norrbotten have also seen an increase, often limited to a specific area.\n\nMany of those affected by the disease have been infected via mosquito bites.\n\n[Byline: Emma Loefgren]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.\n\nTularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ naturally infects several mammalian wildlife species in northern Europe, in particular, mice, rabbits, hares, beavers, voles, lemmings, and muskrats. The ticks _Dermacentor reticularis_ and _Ixodes ricinus_ are vectors for the bacterium, although previous research has suggested that mosquito bites are the most frequent route of transmission to humans in Sweden.\n\nIn addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread via contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe manifestations of infection in this growing outbreak in parts of Sweden are not stated. If vector borne, the most common form would be ulceroglandular with an ulcer at the introduction site and enlarged lymph nodes in that area. If waterborne, oropharyngeal would be most common. Among flying vectors, deer flies are often brought up but mosquitoes are also relevant as shown in this Swedish publication:\n\nThelaus J, Andersson A, Broman T, et al: _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies holarctica occurs in Swedish mosquitoes, persists through the developmental stages of laboratory-infected mosquitoes and is transmissible during blood feeding.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether mosquitoes acquire the bacterium as aquatic larvae and transmit the disease as adults. Mosquitoes sampled in a Swedish area where tularemia is endemic (Orebro) were positive for the presence of _F. tularensis_ deoxyribonucleic acid throughout the summer. Presence of the clinically relevant _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was confirmed in 11 out of the 14 mosquito species sampled. Experiments performed using laboratory-reared _Aedes aegypti_ confirmed that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was transstadially maintained from orally infected larvae to adult mosquitoes and that 25% of the adults exposed as larvae were positive for the presence of _F. tularensis_-specific sequences for at least 2 weeks. In addition, we found that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ was transmitted to 58% of the adult mosquitoes feeding on diseased mice. In a small-scale in vivo transmission experiment with _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_-positive adult mosquitoes and susceptible mice, none of the animals developed tularemia. However, we confirmed that there was transmission of the bacterium to blood vials by mosquitoes that had been exposed to the bacterium in the larval stage.

It's also possible for the infection to be transmitted by inhaling dust or drinking water that is contaminated by urine or feces from animals with the disease, according to Swedish healthcare service 1177. The disease cannot be carried from human to human.\n\nIt is too early to measure the exact extent of the disease this year [2019], since statistics from the Public Health Agency won't be available until later. But the Swedish Veterinary Institute has warned of several findings of dead animals that had been infected with the disease, and a 'suspected outbreak'.\n\nA total of 33 people in the Gavleborg region have been affected by rabbit fever since the start of July [2019], according to regional healthcare authorities. In most cases, the patients had been infected in the Ljusdal area, and one case related to a patient who became sick after cleaning out a barn.\n\nAt least 12 people have been affected by rabbit fever in the Dalarna region alone, a doctor in communicable diseases told SVT Dalarna, and he said the figure was expected to increase.\n\n'It looks like there will be a lot of cases this year [2019], more than last year [2018],' doctor Anders Lindblom said, adding: 'Not everyone [who is affected by rabbit fever] seeks medical care and reports the illness.'\n\nAt least a further 5 people have confirmed cases of rabbit fever in Norrbotten too. Sweden had a large outbreak of rabbit fever in 2015, when 859 people across the country suffered from the illness, the majority of them in Norrbotten and Vasterbotten. In 2018, 107 cases were reported across Sweden, with Dalarna the most severely affected region.\n\nSymptoms of rabbit fever typically begin with swelling or tenderness in the lymph node and a skin lesion at the site of any bite or direct contact, followed occasionally by symptoms that can include a skin rash, nausea, and headaches.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from infection is to avoid mosquito bites as much as possible (either by using repellents, or wearing long, loose clothing when going outside between dusk and dawn), and being especially careful if you need to touch a dead animal such as a rodent or hare, using precautions such as a face mask and gloves.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.\n\nTularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ naturally infects several mammalian wildlife species in northern Europe, in particular, mice, rabbits, hares, beavers, voles, lemmings, and muskrats. The ticks _Dermacentor reticularis_ and _Ixodes ricinus_ are vectors for the bacterium, although previous research has suggested that mosquito bites are the most frequent route of transmission to humans in Sweden.\n\nIn addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread via contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB]\n\n[Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods.

They frequently forage on grasses, forbs, roots, bulbs, tubers, bark, snails, and insects. To find food, voles construct tunnels and surface runways with many burrow openings. Several adults and young can live in these runway systems. This intricate network of tunnels and burrows provides voles with excellent shelter from the weather and protection from predators.

According to information from the district administrative office in Swan village, the men had, on 27 Oct 2018, shot 8 eight rabbits and eviscerated and packed them. Eight of the men have been hospitalized since 4 Nov 2018 at the Amberg hospital, the district office spokesman Hans Prechtl confirmed. The 9th hunter was admitted 5 days later.\n\nTularemia (rabbit fever) is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. People can become infected through close contact with diseased animals or their tissues, writes the Bavarian state office for health and food safety. It is risky dealing with the carcasses when killed animals are eviscerated and skinned. Rabbit fever is primarily an occupational disease of hunters, but also of chefs, butchers, and veterinarians.\n\nAccording to the Robert Koch Institute, each year only a few dozen cases are reported. In the year 2017, 52 people in Germany were afflicted, 13 of them in Bavaria. The disease is compulsorily reportable. To protect against the disease, the Bavarian state office recommends only eating wild game dishes that have been well cooked and avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals or carcasses.\n\nIn the Bavarian hunters, the pathogen is still not officially proven, said press secretary of the County Office Hans Precht. A 2nd blood sample was currently being examined at the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin. The diagnosis is 'very highly' [sic].\n\nAll the men have improved.

Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family _Francisellaceae_. A total of 4 subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp _holarctica_ (type B) is much more widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. _mediasiatica_ and _F. tularensis_ subsp _novicida_, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed. With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the northern hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa.\n\n'Among the northern hemisphere, _F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. Contrarily, _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.\n\n'Humans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass. Human infections have also been linked to handling infected animals or being bitten by them.

'This indicates presence of this disease in the area.'\n\nThere haven't been any known new human cases of tularemia in the local community, according to Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator Julie Pryde.\n\nAlso called rabbit fever, tularemia is a disease of both animals and humans that is transmitted by an infection of a highly-infectious bacteria.\n\nThe bacterium isn't spread from person-to-person, but it can enter the body through the eyes, mouth, lungs, and skin through bites of infected ticks, handling of infected animals, or breathing it in.\n\nAmong the known cases of tularemia in Champaign county in recent years there have been a human death in 2014, as well as infections of cats in years that include 2011, 2012, and 2013.\n\nPryde said it isn't unusual for rabbits to have tularemia. It becomes more concerning if the disease strikes more rabbits than usual, or if there is a large die-off of rabbits or signs that it's turning up in cats, she said.\n\nAmong the other animals that have also been known to become ill with tularemia are muskrats, prairie dogs, and other rodents, according to the health district. Domestic cats are very susceptible and can transmit the bacteria to people.\n\nUntreated, tularemia can be fatal, but the disease is treatable with antibiotics, and most people recover.\n\nSymptoms in people can include sudden fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and a skin ulcer at a bite site. Both pets and people who develop symptoms should get immediate medical attention.\n\nTo be on the safe side, Pryde advised, avoid direct contact with dead animals. 'In general, if you find a dead rabbit, do not touch it,' she said.\n\nUrbana Animal Control Officer Amy Anderson said the safest way to dispose of a dead animal such as a rabbit is to wear gloves, pick it up with a shovel, double-bag the animal, and place it in the trash. Then disinfect the shovel, she said.\n\nExperts also advise avoiding running over dead animals with tractors and lawn mowers if possible. Risk of contact with the bacteria can further be reduced by wearing masks and protective clothing when doing yard work and using insect repellent when outdoors.\n\n[Byline: Debra Pressey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere.\n\n_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America.

He fell ill after he had been cutting brush on his Oak Bluffs property, his daughter said. He did not seek medical treatment on the island and went back to western Massachusetts, where he sought treatment when his symptoms grew worse, she said.\n\nTularemia is a tick-borne illness that can be transmitted by a tick bite and also from infected dead animals, causing a pneumonia-like illness that can be fatal. Spokesmen for the state Department of Public Health and Cooley Dickinson said this week that they could not confirm or comment on the case, citing laws that protect patient confidentiality. Public-health officials on the Vineyard said the recent case should not be cause for alarm but rather an opportunity to raise awareness about prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment, especially as tick-borne illnesses become more prevalent.\n\n'This case should not be looked at as Armageddon,' said Dr. Sam Telford, professor of infectious diseases and global health at Tufts University who has extensively studied tick-borne illnesses and is widely considered the top expert on the Vineyard. He said island medical practitioners have become expert by now at diagnosis. 'It is well entrenched on Martha's Vineyard and no longer a surprise,' he said. 'The people at the hospital are well versed in this: they can smell tularemia when it comes in the door.' Dr. Telford said between 3 and 15 cases of tularemia have been documented on the Vineyard every year going back to 1999. 'It is a little late in the season; typically, we see tularemia cases early in the summer,' he added.\n\nAccording to data tracked by Island Health Care in Edgartown, which contracts with island towns for public-health services, in 2017 there were 6 reported cases of tularemia. So far in 2018, 4 cases have been reported, according to Lila Fischer, a public-health nurse with the agency. Healthcare providers in Massachusetts are required to report suspected and confirmed cases of tularemia immediately to the Department of Public Health, which also directs them to send isolates to the state public-health laboratory for analysis. Isolates are samples of bacteria isolated from a specimen.\n\nNationwide, tularemia is a relatively rare disease, according to the CDC, which has tracked its incidence since 1950. Between 2006 and 2016, there were an average of 172 reported cases per year across the country, with the highest incidence in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, where there are 25-35 cases per year in each state. In New England, tularemia is extremely rare apart from Martha's Vineyard, which state statistics show reached a high of 16 confirmed and probable cases in 2008. The majority of cases, according to the state DPH, have been people who work outdoors, especially landscapers.\n\nTularemia can be contracted in one of several ways. The disease is carried by certain ticks including the common dog tick (also called the wood tick). A person can also become infected after touching, handling, eating, or being bitten by an infected animal, or having contact with water or soil that has been contaminated by an infected animal. The most serious form is pneumonic tularemia, which usually results from breathing dusts or aerosols containing the organism. Between 2000 and 2010, more than 40 people on Martha's Vineyard were diagnosed with the pneumonic variety, according to a Department of Public Health update issued in May 2010.\n\nThe last known death from tularemia on Martha's Vineyard was in 2000, when a 43-year-old landscaper from Chilmark contracted the pneumonic form and failed to seek medical attention in time. Investigators suspected that he may have inhaled the remains or feces of an infected rodent while mowing a lawn near Squibnocket.\n\nSymptoms may include fever, swollen glands, body aches, coughing, and chest pains. In the case of tularemia caused by a tick bite, the area of entry may be inflamed and sore. Symptoms usually occur within 3-5 days of exposure but can take as long as 21 days to show up. Early treatment with antimicrobials usually cures the disease in a few days. The disease is confirmed with a blood test and cultures.\n\nPublic-health officials recommend that people who work outdoors check for dead animals before using any lawn-mowing or brush-cutting equipment, avoid touching dead animals with bare hands, and use a dust mask. Anyone who spends time outdoors is reminded to take precautions against tick bites, including wearing long, light-colored pants tucked into socks or boots and using insect repellent and permethrin-treated clothing, and checking their body for ticks after possible exposure. Anyone who has symptoms is urged to seek early treatment and, if off island, advise healthcare providers of the risks.\n\nDr. Telford praised the work of the tick-borne illness prevention program led by island biologist Dick Johnson and the educational website developed by the island boards of health. 'There's plenty of stuff to be worried about on Martha's Vineyard,' he said. 'Tularemia is not something that should cause people to become hysterical... we need to protect against tick bites; this patient was doing yard work, so that's a signal. It all boils down to the fact that ticks are keeping these infections around in nature, and we need to something about it.'\n\n[Byline: Julia Wells]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Human infection with _Francisella tularensis_, a Category A bioterrorism agent, continues to be a problem on Martha's Vineyard, a 100-square-mile [259-square-kilometer] island off the southern coast of Cape Cod, MA. A substantial number of the cases are pneumonic, occurring in landscapers and gardeners, related to the aerosolization of infective bacteria, and that is likely the case here. Most of the fatalities in tularemia are related to the pneumonic form. As with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, if the infection presents in low-prevalence areas, morbidity and mortality rates can be higher.\n\nTelford and colleagues (1) have investigated the genetic diversity of _F. tularensis_ obtained from Martha's Vineyard ticks. Between 2001 and 2003, 0.7 percent of 4246 dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) harbored the tularemia bacillus, and there was a degree of genotypic diversity, suggestive of long-standing enzootic transmission of the infection on the island. The authors review information regarding the island's tularemia, which appears to have been a relatively recent introduction into Massachusetts. They state that prior to 1937, only one case of the infection was recognized, related to contaminated rabbit meat from the midwestern USA. In 1937, however, more than 20 000 cottontail rabbits from the midwestern states of Missouri and Kansas were introduced into the mainland state and Martha's Vineyard for sporting purposes (2). Cases began to occur starting several years later.\n\n1. Goethert HK, Shani I, Telford SR.

It's also known as 'rabbit fever' or 'deer fly fever' and frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents.\n\nThe marmot was found by a U.S. Forest Service employee. Crater Lake will not be closed but warning signs telling people to not let their pets swim in the water, not to drink the water and to wear bug spray will likely be posted.\n\nPeople can become ill with tularemia after being bitten by ticks, deer flies or horse flies. It can also be transmitted by handling infected animals, or through ingestion or contact with untreated, contaminated water or insufficiently cooked meat.\n\nDan Forman, the county's emergency veterinarian and chairman of the Teton District Board of Health, called tularemia 'unprecedented for our region.'\n\n'We're having more tick-borne diseases that we feel will most likely be a growing trend in this area with changes in our climate patterns,' Forman said. 'We feel this is a trend that will continue.'\n\nAccording to State Public Health Veterinarian Karl Musgrave, there are no reported cases of tularemia in Teton County's humans, at least back to 2015. It's hard to tell how the marmot became infected, he said.\n\n'Tularemia can be in water, we know that,' Musgrave said. 'It can also be in ticks, it can be in deer flies. So we don't really know how the marmot got it.'\n\nIn 2017, there were 2 human cases reported, both in Park County, and in 2016, there were 7. 2015 was a busy year, with 21 human cases reported.\n\n'We have tularemia periodically across the state,' said Kim Deti, Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman.

Also known as 'rabbit fever,' the Cook county case has been tied to rabbit exposure. A wild rabbit found in Tinley Park tested positive for tularemia over the weekend [16-17 Jun 2018 - see prior ProMED-mail post Tularemia - USA (03): (IL) wild rabbit 20180619.5863284 for details.- Mod.MPP].\n\nThe state public health department was unable to confirm a specific individual, location or time that could identify the patient, citing federal confidentiality laws. IDPH is prohibited from providing private health information. The patient being treated for tularemia is reportedly from Tinley Park and was handling baby wild rabbits, according to a source.\n\nCook County Animal and Rabies Control issued an alert to residents over the weekend [16-17 Jun 2018] confirming that a wild rabbit found in Tinley Park underwent testing at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine in Champaign came back positive for tularemia.\n\nThe rabbit was found 13 Jun 2018 in the 7500 block of West 161st Place in Tinley Park. According to the CDC, tularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium _ Francisella tularensis_. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening, and all forms are accompanied by fever, which can be as high as 104 deg F [40 deg C]. Although tularemia can be life-threatening, most infections can be treated successfully with antimicrobials.\n\nRabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during outbreaks. Tularemia has been reported in every state except for Hawaii. Humans can become infected through several routes, including:\n- tick and deer fly bites;\n- skin contact with infected animals;\n- ingestion of contaminated water;\n- inhalation of contaminated aerosols or agricultural dusts;\n- laboratory exposure\n\nTularemia exposure can be prevented by taking the following steps:\n- use of insect repellent;\n- wearing gloves when handling sick or dead animals;\n- avoiding mowing over dead animals\n\nResidents are advised to keep pets and children away from deceased animals, particularly rabbits. Monitor your pets when out walking so they don't approach or eat deceased animals. If you find a dead rabbit or rodent on your property, contact Cook County Animal and Rabies Control at 708-974-6140 for further removal instructions.\n\n[Byline: Lorraine Swanson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Tinley Park, Illinois, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2972\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _D. variabilis_ (dog tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe infection does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.\n\n_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1).

One week later she was taken ill with high fever and headache which was later diagnosed as ulceroglandular tularemia in regional lymph nodes, caused by _Francisella tularensis_. Recovery was only achieved after several weeks of systemic antimicrobial treatment (gentamicin/ciprofloxacin).\n\nTularemia is a well known zoonotic disease, called 'rabbit fever', mainly affecting rabbits and hares, but also small rodents. Human infection occurs often following tick bites or bloodsucking insects, or in hunters or slaughterers handling infected animals. Bites by mice have also been reported as a cause of tularemia.\n\nFor the first time we report this case of tularemia as a result of an attack by a bird of prey. We assume that the bird acted as a vector just carrying the _F. tularensis_ on its claws or beak, but we cannot exclude an infection of the bird itself. Several other joggers had also been attacked by a common buzzard in the same area shortly after the above described event and one of these also became infected with _F. tularensis_.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nCatherine O'Connor\nEpidemic Intelligence team, Public Health England\n<catherine.oconnor@phe.gov.uk>\n\n[ProMED very much thanks Catherine O'Connor for submitting the citation related to this unusual mode of transmission of _F. tularensis_. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nSwitzerland: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/105]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nCatherine O'Connor\nEpidemic Intelligence team, Public Health England\n<catherine.oconnor@phe.gov.uk>\n\n[ProMED very much thanks Catherine O'Connor for submitting the citation related to this unusual mode of transmission of _F. tularensis_.

Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector.

The disease is treatable, but it's essential to get an animal to a veterinarian as soon as possible when they're showing signs, like high fever.\n\nState Wildlife Veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen said her office is getting the word out about tularemia after a recent rash of reports of animals sickened by the disease around Fairbanks and Palmer.\n\n'Just in the last 2 weeks, there's been a very significant increase in the number of reports,' Beckman said. 'In fact I had 5 reports in just 2 days, earlier this week [week of Sun 13 Aug 2017].'\n\nBeckmen advises pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals for any signs of the disease, because it can kill quickly.\n\n'Many people, if their dog is just acting lethargic, maybe has a little fever, they might wait 1-2 days to go in [to the veterinarian],' Beckman said. 'But we want people to know this is really an urgent matter, to get on antibiotics, sooner rather than later.'\n\nBeckman cited the example of 2 household cats in North Pole that died last week [week of Sun 6 Aug 2017], soon after their owner noticed one of them was sick.\n'The 1st one died and was diagnosed,' Beckman said. 'And yet, in the same household, the 2nd cat became ill, and wasn't treated in time. So they lost their other cat.'\n\nBob Gerlach, the State Veterinarian, said pet owners should look for signs that may not be so easy to detect, especially in younger animals.\n\n'Generally, pets can show mild infection and show no signs,' Gerlach said. 'Or may show some fever, lack of appetite, lethargy and just not feeling good.'\n\nFish and Game experts say pet owners shouldn't allow cats and dogs to eat hares, voles and other small mammals that could contract tularemia. Pets that show any signs of the disease should be examined and treated as soon as possible, the experts say.\n\nBeckmen said cats and dogs usually contract tularemia by eating the flesh of a sickened animal - usually, the snowshoe hare. She said humans, in turn, can come down with the disease through their household pets. She said it doesn't happen often; the most recent reported case in the Interior was 2 years ago, when a North Pole man got sick after skinning an infected hare.\n\n'It can be very, very serious,' Beckman said. 'I know of one case where a person who got it from taking a hare out of their cat's mouth, and had some serious, permanent heart damage.'\n\nBeckmen said hares, rabbits and other small mammals come into contact with the bacteria that causes tularemia through ticks that latch on to them. She said the growing number of tick species in this part of the subarctic contributes to the increase in reports of animals contracting the disease.\n\nIn Alaska, hares and other mammals most often are exposed to the bacteria that cause tularemia through the bite of a hare tick. But, Beckmen says in recent years other ticks have been showing up in the Interior that also could transmit the bacteria. (Alaska Department of Fish and Game)\n\n'The hare ticks and vole ticks are normal and we've always had those,' Beckman said. 'But what's new is that we have dog ticks. And for about the past 10 years probably those were introduced and they've become established.'\n\nBeckmen also said there are a lot more snowshoe hares this year [2017] because the species is nearing the peak of its population cycle.\n\n'There's a very high number of hares, which happens on a 7-to 10-year cycle,' Beckman said. 'So we expect to see a lot more tularemia during a 'hare high.' '\n\nGerlach, the state vet, said livestock usually aren't susceptible to tularemia.

The discovery prompted officials to urge the public to protect themselves and their pets from ticks when hiking or walking in grassy, backcountry areas, on trails and in the wild.\n\nTicks are tiny, 8-legged parasites related to spiders. They crawl out on leaves and vegetation and extend their hooked front legs to latch onto passing animals and people, then bite and feed on blood. Even though tick diseases are rare in San Diego County, they have also been known to carry other diseases including Lyme disease and spotted fever illnesses, officials said in a press release.\n\nVector Control officials said they have been finding increased numbers of ticks in 2018 around the county, although the ones collected in Sorrento Valley were the only ones that have tested positive for any disease. The County's Vector Control Program monitors the population of vectors -- animals like ticks, fleas, rodents and mosquitoes -- that can transmit diseases to people.\n\nTularemia can be successfully treated with antimicrobials, but can be dangerous and even fatal. County public health officials said anyone who is bitten by a tick should not panic, but carefully remove it. They said if a person develops a rash or fever within several weeks of being bitten they should see a doctor, tell them about the tick bite, when they were bitten and where they think it happened.\n\nHealth officials offered the following tips to help you protect yourself, your family and pets from ticks:\n- Wear insect repellent\n- Stay on designated pathways\n- Avoid grass and brush\n- Frequently check your clothing, body and companions for tick\n- Leave pets at home or keep them leashed\n\n[Byline: Hoa Qu\u00e1ch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This is from the San Diego County Department of Health\nhttps://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/deh/pests/tularemia.html:\n\n'Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.

The disease can be transmitted by infected animals, wood ticks, deer flies and contaminated water or soil. Cats are a common transmitter to humans, typically contracting the disease from a squirrel or rabbit.

In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.

The isolate was submitted to the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories for confirmatory testing using Laboratory Response Network (LRN) reference methods. Hospital A laboratory personnel reported that the isolate had been manipulated on the open bench and certain laboratory workers had potentially been exposed. The Division of Public Health, hospital A, and Eastern Idaho Public Health initiated an investigation to confirm _F. tularensis_, assess potential laboratory exposures, and determine the source of infection. The investigation determined that the infectious agent was veillonella and not _F. tularensis_.\n\nThe patient, a man aged over 75 years, had a multiyear history of chronic unilateral knee pain, during which time he had received a series of 3 intra-articular injections of hyaluronate sodium 2 years previously, and several intra-articular injections of triamcinolone with bupivacaine, the last of which occurred 15 days before he sought care at hospital A for a swollen knee. Gram staining of an intra-articular aspirate obtained that day from the affected knee showed Gram-variable cocci. The aspirate was cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Slow-growing colonies of Gram negative cocci were observed from the anaerobic culture, with limited growth in aerobic conditions. Because an anaerobic AMIS panel was not available, isolates from the aerobic culture were processed for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility on the AMIS using a panel specific for aerobic organisms. Identification of _F. tularensis_ by the AMIS triggered notification of the Division of Public Health and revision of the patient's antimicrobial regimen from vancomycin, piperacillin, and tazobactam to ciprofloxacin. Eastern Idaho Public Health interviewed the patient and determined that he lived in a rural area and reported no recent exposure to potential sources of naturally occurring _F. tularensis_ (for example, ill animals, arthropod bites, contaminated water, or use of lawn mowers or string trimmers near dead animals).\n\nThe Idaho Bureau of Laboratories and Eastern Idaho Public Health provided the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] guidance on tularemia laboratory exposure (1) to hospital A and assisted staff members in assessing potential exposures of laboratory personnel. Among 24 employees interviewed by hospital A, 19 were considered to have potential exposure; all 19 elected to start antimicrobial prophylaxis because of a high level of concern regarding risk and the approximately 48 hours required for confirmatory testing.\n\nUsing LRN real-time polymerase chain reaction methods, the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories tested the isolate for _F. tularensis_ and _Brucella spp_.; no _F. tularensis_ or _Brucella spp_ DNA was detected. Subsequent partial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing identified a _Veillonella sp_. According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, Veillonella species-level identification could not be reported because the 16S rRNA gene fragment had a more than 99 per cent sequence identity for both _V. parvula_ and _V. dispar_ without a less than 0.8 per cent difference between them (2). Partial RNA polymerase subunit B gene (rpoB) sequencing conducted on the isolate found a more than 99 per cent sequence identity to V. parvula_, suggesting this as the most likely species of the isolate (3). After identification of _Veillonella sp_., the patient's antimicrobial regimen was changed to piperacillin, tazobactam, and ertapenem sodium; personnel who were receiving prophylactic antimicrobials for potential _F. tularensis_ exposure were informed that continuation of prophylaxis was not recommended or necessary. The Division of Public Health reviewed MedWatch data and did not identify any reports of veillonella infection associated with hyaluronate sodium, triamcinolone, or bupivacaine. The source of this patient's infection was not determined.\n\n_Veillonella spp._ are small, slow-growing, nonmotile anaerobic Gram negative cocci found as part of the normal flora of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vaginal tracts. Although _Veillonella spp._ are classified as anaerobes, anaerobic organisms (including _Veillonella spp._) have been observed growing in aerobic conditions for a limited time after isolation before becoming nonviable (4). Often considered contaminants of clinical specimen collection, _Veillonella spp._ have been rarely isolated from monomicrobial cultures of invasive infections. Predisposing factors for invasive infection have not been fully studied, but might include local or systemic immune suppression and localized anaerobic conditions produced by tissue necrosis, diminished blood supply, or prolonged infection with aerobes (5).\n\nThis is the 1st published report of misidentification of _Veillonella sp._ as _F. tularensis_ by an AMIS and of isolation of _Veillonella sp._ from a nonprosthetic knee. Hospital and public health staff members responded appropriately to the preliminary misidentification of the isolate as _F. tularensis_; however, accurate identification would have obviated the need for time-intensive response activities, use of prophylactic antimicrobials by hospital staff members, and inappropriately targeted antimicrobial therapy for the patient. Clinical laboratories are advised not to use a commercial AMIS if a select agent is suspected in a clinical sample (6) and to consult with their LRN-biologic laboratory for guidance and sample referral. Clinicians should consider _Veillonella spp._ when receiving laboratory reports of _F. tularensis_ generated by AMISs. Because _Veillonella spp._ are typically resistant to recommended or alternative antimicrobial therapies for tularemia (i.e., streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, and other fluoroquinolones), antibacterial coverage for both _Veillonella spp._ and _F. tularensis_ could be considered until final microbial identification is available.\n\n[authors: Carter KK, Peterson EM, Voermans RL, et al]\n\n* Tier 1 select agents are biologic agents and toxins that present the greatest risk for deliberate misuse with significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence, and pose a severe threat to public health and safety.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

These last 4 people, as it turned out, visited the village of Artsvaberd. Currently, only 1 of the infected people continues to receive inpatient treatment. There were no severe cases of illness. Artavazd Vanyan, Head of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention of MoH, said this during the parliamentary hearings in the Standing Committee on Health Care, Maternity and Social Welfare issues.\n\nAccording to him, the first case was clinically detected on [29 Aug 2017]. He was a resident of Yerevan who applied to the Nork infectious hospital. In early August [2017], this person had visited the village of Artsvaberd of Tavush region. The specialists of the Center visited the village and found out that some villagers already had some clinical manifestations of tularemia, and had been locally wrongfully treated for angina.\n\nAccording to Artavazd Vanyan, the investigation has shown that the infection in the village of Artsvaberd occurred from the end of July [2017] to the middle of August [2017]. The causative agent of tularemia was not isolated during the investigation of water and food samples, or from animals. That is, the infection occurred without a clear epizootic. The Center came to the conclusion that the infection could occur by air/dust- borne during haymaking, which is evidence of its forms, oculoglandular and angino-glandular [oroglandular? - Mod.LL], as well as the fact that all the affected lived close to one another.\n\n'This is the first time in Armenia when people got sick with tularemia without a clear animal infection, and the first time that the transmission of the pathogen occurred by air/dust,' Artavazd Vanyan said.\n\nHe added that the Artsvaberd village is located in the border with Azerbaijan, and Armenian specialists cannot conduct surveys of the entire territory. According to Artavazd Vanyan, Azerbaijan, like Armenia, is an endemic country for tularemia, and, probably, penetration of the animal reservoir took place from that side.\n\nTaking into account that the risk of infection continues, the Center decided to vaccinate all residents over 7 years of the village of Artsvaberd and neighboring villages - Chinari, Norashen, Choratan and Aygedzor. Vaccination, in his words, will protect them from tularemia in the next 5 years.\n\nAnswering the question of Ms. Margarita Yesayan, parliamentarian, about the possibility of deliberate contamination of Armenian territories, Artavazd Vanyan noted that, judging by the fact that there was a local outbreak, and not an epidemic, this seems unlikely.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic infection in which patients experience intoxication, fever, and lymph node involvement. The causative agent of the disease is _Francisella tularensis_. Some animals, including rabbits, hare and water rats are considered carriers of tularemia bacteria. Infection is transmitted to a person by direct contact with sick animals or through contaminated food and water. There are fewer cases of tularemia infection by aspiration - for example, when processing grain products, threshing bread, and sometimes there are cases of infection through blood-sucking arthropods.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED sincerely thanks the EpiCore members who were able to supply the original citation in Armenian and then translate it into a cogent form.

The oculoglandular form is one of the rarest forms. In this study, we evaluated tularemia patients, focusing on the ocular form and the efficacy of early antimicrobial therapy.\n\n'Methodology: During a tularemia outbreak, the epidemiological and clinical findings, laboratory assays, and drugs used for the treatment of 48 patients were recorded prospectively. The diagnosis of tularemia was confirmed with microagglutination test (MAT) as well as clinical findings.\n\n'Results: The mean age of the subject was 48.6 years; 23 (47.9 percent) of them were female. 36 (81.25 percent) patients had clinical presentation compatible with oropharyngeal tularemia, 7 (14.58 percent) with oculoglandular tularemia, and 2 (4.1 percent) with ulceroglandular tularemia. The most common symptoms were fever (91.6 percent) and sore throat (81.2 percent), and the most common findings were lymphadenopathy (91.6 percent) and tonsillopharyngitis (81.2 percent). In the oculoglandular form, fever, lymphadenopathy, periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis were found. The most distinctive ophthalmic feature was follicular conjunctivitis and conjunctival epithelial defects. A total of 45 cases had positive serological results with MAT. All the patients were treated with antimicrobials considered effective against _F. tularensis_, and topical antimicrobial treatment was given to the patients with oculoglandular tularemia. As many as 26 (54.16 percent) patients, who were admitted within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms, recovered without sequel.\n\n'Conclusions: During tularemia outbreaks, ocular involvement should be considered carefully. The early administration of appropriate treatment will be more effective in resolving the infection and preventing complications. Along with systemic antimicrobial therapy, topical treatment will help recovery.'\n\nAgain, ProMED would much appreciate any other suggestions regarding the translation. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/133.]", "summary": "36 (81.25 percent) patients had clinical presentation compatible with oropharyngeal tularemia, 7 (14.58 percent) with oculoglandular tularemia, and 2 (4.1 percent) with ulceroglandular tularemia.

According to the report, at least 20 people in the village of Artsvaberd in Tavush province were affected by the outbreak. The report does not state how the villagers were infected.\n\nTularemia can be transmitted to people, such as hunters, who have handled infected animals. Infection can also arise from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies); by exposure to contaminated food, water, or soil; by eating, drinking, putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth before washing after outdoor activities; by direct contact with breaks in the skin; or by inhaling particles carrying the bacteria (through mowing or blowing vegetation and excavating soil).\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans may include fever, chills, headache, swollen and painful lymph glands, and fatigue. If tularemia is caused by the bite of an infected insect or from bacteria entering a cut or scratch, it usually causes a skin ulcer or pustule and swollen glands. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, mouth ulcers, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Inhaling the bacterium may cause an infection of the lungs with chest pain and coughing.\n\nTularemia can be effectively treated with antimicrobials. Untreated tularemia can lead to hospitalization and may be fatal if not diagnosed and treated appropriately.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms.\n\nThe report does not give information about the clinical manifestations of tularemia in these cases, the mode of transmission or the method of diagnosis (clinical, serology or culture). Additionally, the time span of the development of the cases is not given, which would help decide whether the cases may be related (occurring over a short time) as opposed to 20 cases in 2017. A cluster of 20 cases would suggest a common source exposure such as contaminated water or food. ProMED would appreciate more information in this regard.\n\nTavush is a province of Armenia.

She had been taking amoxicillin for a dental infection. She was evaluated on 6 Jun 2017 for 4 days of fever, myalgia, anorexia, and diarrhea. Because of suspected colitis she was advised to discontinue amoxicillin; she declined hospital admission. Two days later, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath and confusion. Chest radiography revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia and an effusion. This was treated with cefepime and intravenous doxycycline. On 8 Jun 2017, her stool tested positive for _Clostridium difficile_ toxin A/B by polymerase chain reaction, requiring treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin. Her condition deteriorated, and she died on 11 Jun 2017. Tularemia was not suspected as cause of illness until 17 Jun 2017 when a blood culture collected on 6 Jun 2017 was confirmed as _F. tularensis_, a Tier 1 select agent; no laboratory exposures occurred.\n\nThe patient lived in a semirural area of northern Arizona, did not engage in outdoor activities, and had no known history of insect bites, exposure to animal carcasses or untreated water. She traveled to Hawaii 16-26 May 2016, returning about 11 days before illness onset. Postmortem exam revealed no bites, abscesses, or lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe patient's dog was noted to be lethargic and anorexic in late May 2016, 3 days after being found with a rabbit carcass in its mouth. The patient and dog had frequent close contact. Serum from the dog, obtained about 3 weeks after its illness and the patient's death, had a _F. tularensis_-specific titer of 1:256. An assessment of the property on 23 Jun 2017 revealed numerous rabbits and one squirrel carcass with _F. tularensis_ DNA detected in its liver and spleen. Genotyping of _F. tularensis_ from squirrel and human samples showed both infections were attributable to an A.II strain.\n\nAbout 125 human tularemia cases are reported in the USA annually. Humans are infected through arthropod bites, contact with infectious tissues, inhalation, or ingestion (1). Symptoms commonly begin 3-5 days after exposure and can include fever, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea (1). 2 _F. tularensis_ subspecies, _tularensis_ (Type A) and _holarctica_ (Type B), cause human tularemia (1,2). Distinct clades within Type A (A.I and A.II) are associated with different virulence in humans and laboratory animals (2,3). A.II strains are localized to the western USA and associated with milder illness than are A.I strains (2,3).\n\nBased on the patient's respiratory symptoms, radiographic findings, and lack of alternative exposure history, exposure likely occurred at her property through inhalation of _F. tularensis_, potentially via close contact with her dog. The dog might have transmitted infectious material through oral secretions after mouthing an infected carcass or brought infectious material on its fur into contact with the patient. Human illness linked to dogs has been documented (3).\n\nThe role of pulmonary sarcoidosis in this patient's illness is unclear, but it might have contributed to the severe outcome of infection with an A.II strain (4). Concurrent infection with _C. difficile_ might also have exacerbated the clinical course of tularemia. Diagnosis of tularemia is challenging because symptoms are nonspecific and exposure history is often unclear. Thorough ascertainment of animal exposures, including nature of contact, might refine clinical suspicion for specific zoonoses. Preventing exposure and implementing early, appropriate therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality. Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

A Mesa County couple called health officials after finding the rabbit on their property. 'We've lived out here for over 20 years,' said [CW]. 'We have a lot of coyotes, bobcats different things, badgers are out here.'\n\nHealth officials said they have discovered rabbit fever in neighborhoods east and west of the Colorado National Monument.\n\n'This particular rabbit like to go underneath my car; he hung out there most of the day. One day I came out here and he was dead,' said [W]. 'I bagged it up and took it to the health department, so they examined it and they called me a couple days later saying it was positive for the rabbit disease.'\n\nHomeowners who see multiple animals on their properties should call Mesa County Public Health right away, as it could be a sign of unusual disease activity in the area. 'In the last few years, we've seen an uptick in detecting it in wildlife and in people,' explained Thomas Orr, an epidemiologist with Mesa County Public Health. 'We really want to get the message out so people don't get ill with this. If they do have sick pets or get sick themselves, it is treatable.'\n\nBureau of Land Management spokesperson Chris Joyner said the disease is most common near the river. 'We've seen a lot of cases of Tularemia connected to the river corridors in our high use areas along the river. We have a lot recreation that takes place there,' he said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said to use masks when mowing the lawn to reduce inhaling bacteria. Experts also suggest cooking game meat thoroughly before eating. Tularemia is treatable, according to health officials.

Globally, tularemia has been identified in a wide range of animal hosts; rabbits and rodents are the most important reservoirs (3). Tularemia in humans is typically acquired through direct exposure to infected animals during hunting, although biting insect vectors such as ticks and mosquitos, as well as waterborne and environmental sources, have been reported (1). Outbreaks are not uncommon in disease-endemic areas, and a positive correlation exists between the population density of the animal reservoir and the number of human tularemia cases (4).\n\nUlceroglandular tularemia is the most common form of disease in humans, accounting for about 75 percent of reported cases, and is characterized by fever, ulceration at the site of infection, and enlargement of local lymph nodes (5). Untreated infection by _F. tularensis_ can be life-threatening. Given its multiple routes of transmission, including inhalation of contaminated dust, the bacterium is considered a category A bioterrorism agent in most jurisdictions.\n\nTularemia is endemic to parts of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Eurasia, and most cases in humans are caused by the _F. tularensis_ subspecies _tularensis_ (type A) and _holarctica_ (type B). Notably, regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, have been largely considered tularemia-free. In 2003, a divergent _Francisella spp._ was isolated from a human foot wound in the Northern Territory, Australia (6), and has since been reclassified as _F. hispanensis_ (7). However, in 2011, a case of ulceroglandular tularemia was reported in an adult bitten by a wild ringtail possum (_Pseudocheirus peregrinus_) in western Tasmania, Australia (8). No isolate was obtained in this case, although infection by _F. tularensis_ was suggested by both 16S rRNA sequencing and serology (8). Two additional cases of suspected human tularemia were reported in Tasmania in 2011, close to the site of the original infection (13). These cases suggest a possible wider distribution of _F. tularensis_ in the Southern Hemisphere and a potential reservoir in ringtail possums in Australia.\n\nAs part of a wider study of neglected and undiagnosed disease syndromes observed in Australia wildlife, we investigated the possible infectious cause of several deaths in ringtail possums that were most often associated with acute necrotizing enteritis or hepatitis. In total, 8 possums were included in this study, each representative of a distinct mortality event in Sydney, New South Wales, during 2000-2009. Liver and brain tissue were collected at the time during necropsy and stored at -80 C [-112 F].\n\nTo identify potential pathogens in these possum samples, we used an unbiased, high-throughput RNA sequencing approach (RNA-Seq; Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). Total RNA was 1st extracted from the 8 affected liver tissues and pooled before host ribosomal RNA depletion and library preparation by using Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina; San Diego, CA, USA) with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library preparation kit (Illumina). The library was sequenced by using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform, producing 50 740 088 paired-end sequence reads (100 nt lengths). These data were assembled de novo using Trinity (9) and screened for viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens by comparisons to existing databases by using nucleotide and protein Blast searches (10).\n\nNo viral or fungal pathogens were apparent in the de novo assembled transcripts. Strikingly, however, _F. tularensis_ was abundant, representing about 85 percent of the bacterial contigs identified. Other, less abundant bacteria were species from the genera _Serratia_, _Streptococcus_, _Escherichia_, and _Bacillus_. Remapping the RNA-Seq data against the complete genome of the _F. tularensis_ subsp.<holarctica_ reference strain T01 (GenBank accession no. NZ_CP012092) produced an assembly of 80 516 reads, providing 46.9 percent genome coverage (891 561/1 899 676 nt) at a mean depth of 4.2x and pairwise identity of 99.8 percent. This relatively high abundance suggested that _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ RNA was probably present in the pooled possum liver sample.\n\nTo confirm the infection, individual liver samples were independently screened for _F. tularensis_ at the Emerging Infections and Biohazard Response Unit (EIBRU) at Pathology West, Westmead Hospital, Sydney. This screening involved culturing on enriched cysteine heart agar blood culture medium with antibiotic supplementation (11), and assays provided through the US CDC's Laboratory Response Network that included direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) testing and real-time PCR. No serum was available for serologic testing. Of the 8 liver samples present in the RNA-Seq pool, 2 were positive (samples 2 and 7) for _F. tularensis_ by both DFA and PCR (all 3 gene targets, FT1, FT2, and FT3, were positive). Both of these _F. tularensis_-positive samples were obtained from ringtail possums found in the Sydney north shore area and were associated with 2 separate mass mortality events in May 2002 (sample 7) and August 2003 (sample 2). An _F. tularensis_ isolate was also obtained from sample 7 (denoted FT7) that was identified by morphology, biochemical tests, mass spectrometry, and confirmatory testing by DFA and real-time PCR. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 by using Nextera XT libraries prepared from FT7 genomic DNA in addition to control stocks held by the Emerging Infections and Biohazard Response Unit to eliminate them as possible sources of contamination. Raw sequence data are available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (BioSample accession no. SAMN06114577).\n\nA multilocus phylogenetic comparison of the FT7 isolate and the original possum liver RNA-Seq data revealed that the sequences clearly clustered together within an Asian subclade of the _holarctica_ subspecies that includes biovar _japonica_ (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The differences between the sequences (3 nt across the multilocus region of 7009 nt) are probably best explained by sequence quality with poor coverage (only 1x) in the RNA-Seq data at these positions. A subsequent whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (Figure 2) and subspecies-specific PCR producing an 839-bp product confirmed FT7 as a member of biovar _japonica_ (12). Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from such a conserved region, we note that the sequences from the FT7 isolate and the RNA-Seq data both matched, with 100 percent identity, the 16S rRNA and recA gene sequences identified in the human tularemia case in Tasmania (8). Testing of additional archived tissues from 8 similarly affected ringtail possums and 3 rabbits did not identify further cases positive for _F. tularensis_. Hence, there are probably multiple etiologies for the acute necrotizing enteritis or hepatitis observed.\n\nThe clinical, gross, and histologic findings, in addition to the genetics and microbiology, confirm the diagnosis of _F. tularensis_ infection in >2 ringtail possums associated with 2 mortality events in Sydney. Native ringtail possums in Australia might therefore be a natural reservoir or end-stage host of tularemia and serve as useful sentinels of disease activity that could pose a threat to human health through occasional exposure. A better understanding of the ecology of _F. tularensis_ subsp. _holarctica_ in Australia is necessary to contribute to public health and to wildlife welfare and conservation.\n\nReferences\n1.

Although human infection occurs sporadically throughout the continental USA, historically, cases have been concentrated in the south central states of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri. We used 2 methods to assess changes in the geographic distribution of human tularemia cases reported to CDC through the Nationally Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System during 1965-2013.\n\nReported cases were geocoded to centroids for the county of patient residence. A linear model was fit comparing latitude and longitude of all cases by year, adjusted for population using annual, county-level U.S. Census estimates. To further evaluate geographic trend, a spatial scan cluster detection method based on log likelihood ratio [LLR] tests was used to identify the location of the highest risk spatial cluster of cases for each of 9 - 5-year intervals.\n\nDuring 1965-2013, mean latitude of human tularemia cases in the lower 48 states moved northward 444 km [275.889 miles], from 37\u00b0N to 41\u00b0N (P <.0001), with no change in mean longitude (P =.5). Overall, spatial scan methods identified an area 668 km [415.076 miles] in diameter centered over northwestern Arkansas as the area of greatest risk (LLR: 6663; P <.0001). When evaluated in 5-year intervals, the centroid for this cluster moved from 35\u00b0N in 1965-1969 to 39\u00b0N in 2005-2009, also a change of 444 km.\n\nThe distribution of human tularemia cases in the USA has moved progressively northward since 1965. This trajectory suggests areas of likely emergence where educational efforts may be most needed. The trend is independent of changes in population and may reflect shifts in environmental factors or arthropod vector abundance\n\n[Authors: Kwit NA, Mead P]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although certainly arthropod-borne, many cases of tularemia are acquired by direct animal contact from hunting and dressing game as well as aerosol spread from a contaminated environment.\n\nThe abstract was presented at the CDC EID conference this past week [week of 23 April 2017] in Atlanta and uses data through 2013.

The isolate was confirmed as F. tularensis type B at MDH PHL by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, culture, and direct fluorescent antibody testing. _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies tularensis (type A) and holarctica (type B) bacteria are the causative agents of tularemia.\n\nMDH initiated an epidemiologic investigation to identify potential exposure sources and risks to additional persons. The case occurred in an immunocompetent white, non-Hispanic woman aged 67 years from Sherburne County, Minnesota. On 18 Jun 2016, she was fishing on a freshwater lake in northeastern South Dakota. While removing a hook from a fish, the hook penetrated the pulp of the patient's left middle finger. On 21 Jun 2016, she developed pain and swelling at the site of the puncture and was seen at an urgent care center where she received an injection of ceftriaxone and was prescribed oral cephalexin. The pain and swelling did not improve, and she was seen by her primary care provider the next day. Because of concern about a possible joint infection, the patient was referred to an orthopedic specialist, who saw her on 23 Jun 2017, at which time an enlarged, tender left axillary lymph node was noted. The orthopedist drained the finger wound, collected a swab of cloudy, nonpurulent fluid for culture, and changed the patient's antimicrobial to ciprofloxacin.\n\nAfter MDH PHL confirmed tularemia on 28 Jun 2017, the patient was seen again by the orthopedist; by this time she had developed an eschar-like ulcer. An infectious disease consultation was obtained, ciprofloxacin was discontinued, and a treatment course of doxycycline was initiated and ultimately continued for 5 weeks. As of 8 Jul 2016, the lymphadenopathy had resolved and the ulcerated wound was improving. MDH epidemiologists shared exposure information with the South Dakota Department of Health; no other cases of tularemia were reported from this area of South Dakota in 2016 (South Dakota Department of Health, personal communication, 4 Jan 2017).\n\nTularemia can cause a wide range of symptoms in humans, depending upon the route of inoculation. The infection is often characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and an ulcer at the site of cutaneous inoculation. Type A is frequently associated with lagomorphs (hares, rabbits, and pikas), and type B is frequently associated with rodents and aquatic environments. Type A is often considered more virulent to humans than is type B, but subtypes exist that are associated with varying degrees of severity (1,2). Exposure routes include animal contact, arthropod (ticks and biting flies) bites, and exposure to natural waters (1-5). During 1994-2015, 10 tularemia cases were confirmed in Minnesota residents; 5 were caused by _F. tularensis_ type B (MDH, unpublished data, 2009-2015) (5).\n\nAlthough tularemia is rarely diagnosed in Minnesota, there has been one other culture-confirmed case of a tularemia type B wound infection that resulted after lake water exposure of a superficial cut, sustained while shaving (MDH, unpublished data, 2012). Inoculation by fish hook represents a novel exposure to _F. tularensis_.

The disease can be transmitted from animals; human to human transmission is not known. The disease can be efficiently treated but cases can be severe.\n\nAll 6 patients had been harvesting grapes at the beginning of October 2016 in the northern part of the district. A couple of days later high temperature combined with a severe overall feeling of sickness was observed. The cases are unusual because infections with the pathogen (_Francisella tularensis_) are very rare in Germany and clusters of infection are even rarer.\n\nHumans become infected through direct contact with diseased animals, their organs or excretions. The pathogen can be transmitted through contaminated food as well.\n\nThe health authorities' investigation is assisted by the state lab (LUA). The focus of the investigation is on how the patients harvesting grapes could have become infected. In addition, the federal Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) is performing tests on samples collected from the vineyard. The focus is on food, hare/rabbit droppings, and environmental samples.\n\nTularemia is caused by the pathogen _F. tularensis_. The 1st signs usually are sores at the site of infection inoculation, followed by influenza-like symptoms with fever, swelling of local lymph nodes, chills, and headache. The infection can be treated with antimicrobials.\n\nMedical practitioners in the Mainz-Bingen district are alerted and are asked to consider tularemia in patients with fever or swelling of lymph nodes, especially when the reason for symptoms cannot be established. They are required by law to notify the health authorities of suspect cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen\nGermany\nhttp://www.cvlonghorns.de\n<cvlonghorns@aol.com>\n\n[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food Security & Public Health, Iowa State University, fact sheet on tularemia, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/tularemia.pdf:\n\n'Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect many mammals. Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family _Francisellaceae_. A total of 4 subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp _holarctica_ (type B) is much more widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. _mediasiatica_ and _F. tularensis_ subsp _novicida_, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed. With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa.\n\n'Among the Northern Hemisphere, _F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. Contrarily, _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.\n\n'Humans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass. Human infections have also been linked to handling infected animals or being bitten by them. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported.'\n\nProMED-mail would like more information regarding whether pneumonia was present, whether any regional lymph node enlargement was present and additional information about the epidemiology here and how the diagnoses were made (culture or serology).

The individual is thought to have acquired the illness from her pet puppy. Residents are advised that tularemia-causing bacteria may be present in some of the mammals -- especially rabbits, rodents and hares -- in the area.\n\nPublic Health would ask that if anyone notices a die-off of rodents to please notify the public health office. Tularemia is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by the handling of sick or dead animals infected with tularemia. Infection can also arise from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies), by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, and by the inhalation of airborne bacteria.\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans are fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. If tularemia is caused by the bite of an infected insect or from bacteria entering a cut or scratch, it usually causes a skin ulcer and swollen glands. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Tularemia can be effectively treated with antimicrobials, therefore should you have any of these early signs, seek medical attention as soon as possible.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows symptoms of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to the veterinarian promptly. As in humans, tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In 2015, 52 cases of human tularemia were reported in Colorado, more than 10 times the typical number of 0-4 cases reported annually from 1954-2013. The clinical manifestations of human tularemia depend on the route of entry of the organism into the body. Airborne _Francisella tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease ('gland' in this case referring to lymph nodes). The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity), and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness.

A man in Wichita Falls was recently diagnosed with tularemia - also known as Rabbit Fever. Health officials say it's a rare bacterial infection for this area that comes from tick and deer fly bites, skin contact with infected animals like rabbits and rats, and ingesting contaminated water.\n\nThe Wichita Falls Health Department says they spoke to the man and got some background information including any contact he had with rodents or rabbits and any travel he did to areas in the USA that have the disease.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are normally flu-like - fever, swollen glands and general discomfort. Health officials say they are not sure how he got the disease. They will be meeting shortly to review the case. He told them he had accidentally run over some rabbits while mowing his yard and health officials say he may have come into contact that way.\n\n'The thing that we really want to impress on people - even if this isn't a local transmission - we have the rodent issue this year. There are a lot of rabbits in the area. So if you have a dead animal in your yard do not to handle that with your hands. Be sure to use a plastic bag, a shovel and to put that in the trash and be sure to wash your hands good if you come into contact with any dead animal.'\n\nTularemia can be deadly if the symptoms aren't caught early and the disease progresses. Health department officials say the good news is it can be treated with antimicrobials. The disease cannot be transmitted from person to person - only animal to person. You have to have some contact with either a tick or fly bite or an infected animal.\n\nAccording to family members, the Wichita Falls man with the disease has been transferred to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas for further treatment.\n\n[Byline: Ava Van Valen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. In this case, aerosolization of organisms from the rabbits being run over may have caused tularemia pneumonia.

'This is the season for tularemia and other diseases like giardia,' Stachon said. 'The rule of thumb is don't take a rabbit before it freezes.'\n\nTularemia can be a serious disease and, in rare cases, deadly, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, it frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs. People may acquire tularemia when bitten by infected ticks, deer flies or horse flies. It can also be transmitted by handling infected animals, or through ingestion or contact with untreated, contaminated water or insufficiently cooked meat.\n\nSymptoms of tularemia can include fever, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, skin ulcers and diarrhea. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough and progressive weakness and pneumonia. Stachon said people should be aware of the symptoms; anyone who suspects their illness may be tularemia should review their activities and where they have been recreating. People recreating outdoors should be aware and take precautions, she added.\n\nThough life-threatening if not treated, tularemia responds quickly to antimicrobials, and because the symptoms mimic other illnesses, people are encouraged to tell their doctor if any tularemia exposure is possible, according to the state health department.\n\n[Byline: Ann Jantz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe infection does not spread from person to person, essentially in contradiction to another Category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.\n\n_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition.

Officials typically see only a few cases each year. '5 of those cats did not make it and 3 did, including one that we treated here,' said Dr Jennifer Granick, who works in the Small Animal Internal Medicine Department at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center.\n\nGranick said the disease is caused by a bacterial infection often carried by rabbits, which means hunting cats are at the greatest risk of catching the disease. But ticks and flies can also transmit the disease through bites.\n\nGranick notes pet owners should look out for the classic signs, including high fevers and disinterest in eating. If caught early enough, the disease can be cured with a combination of antibiotics.\n\nAs for dogs and people, both can also contract the disease. However, dogs rarely show signs of the disease, and only a couple people are diagnosed with the disease every year. Experts recommend people beware any signs of the disease in their cats and get medical attention if they see those signs in themselves.\n\nFinal recommendation from experts: try to keep your cats indoors. But veterinarians also recognize that's not possible for all cats. Given that, they encourage owners to monitor their cats' outdoor activity -- to try to curb hunting -- and also use flea and tick preventions.\n\n[Byline: Karla Jult]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia (caused by a bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_) is a rare but potentially fatal disease that occurs in wild and domestic animals. Rabbits and wild rodents are the primary species affected (hence the nickname) but other species, including humans, can also contract the disease.\n\nDogs do become infected with the causative organism, but it appears that resulting illness, if it occurs, does not produce clinical signs or is mild. On the other hand, domestic cats are very susceptible to tularemia and have been known to transmit the bacteria to humans. It's also important to note that cats don't need to be clinically sick in order to transmit the disease.\n\nThe bacterium that causes tularemia can be found in the organs or body fluids of infected animals. Once in the environment, the organisms can survive for weeks to months in the soil, vegetation, or water and then serve as a source of infection for other animals or humans. Animals typically get tularemia by ingesting contaminated food (raw meat from infected animals) or by drinking contaminated water. They can also inhale the aerosolized bacteria, have it enter their bodies through mucus membranes or breaks/cuts in skin, or become infected by biting flies or ticks.\n\nClinical signs in cats\n----------------------\nThe signs of a tularemia infection can vary remarkably; they range from no signs at all, to mild fever and enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) to death. When they're sick, cats may also be anorexic, dehydrated, or listless with ulcers, abscesses, jaundice, pneumonia, and/or enlargement of their livers or spleens. Outdoor cats may be particularly good at not showing clinical signs until the disease is quite advanced.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment\n-----------------------\nIf your veterinarian is suspicious your cat might have tularemia, then special serologic blood tests looking for antibodies against the bacteria are likely to be run. Unfortunately, because it takes time for your cat's immune system to mount a detectable response, these tests may not be diagnostic during the 1st few weeks of illness. A definitive diagnosis can also be made if the organism can be cultured from tissue specimens on special culture media.\n\nOnce infection with tularemia is diagnosed or suspected, antibiotics are usually effective in treating the illness -- especially when given early in the disease. Recovery from the infection does produce long-lasting immunity.\n\nEfforts are underway to develop safe and effective vaccines for pets and people.\n\nPrevention of tularemia\n-----------------------\nThe only way to completely protect your cat from infection is to keep your animal free of ticks and other biting insects. Also, keep your animal indoors away from the opportunity to hunt or to encounter the organism in the environment. It is important, however, to remember that you are also at risk. The most common source of infection for people is the bite of an infected tick, so take care when gardening, clearing weeds/brush, or even mowing lawns.\n\nAdditional information regarding tularemia may be found in the moderator's comments of ProMED-mail post 20160603.4262502.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.pethealthnetwork.com/cat-health/cat-diseases-conditions-a-z/tularemia-rabbit-fever-cats/page/0/1. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16848.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nOnce infection with tularemia is diagnosed or suspected, antibiotics are usually effective in treating the illness -- especially when given early in the disease.

There have been 4 human cases of tularemia in Coconino County since 2005, 2 confirmed cases in 2005 and 2 in 2015, none of which were fatal.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial disease that infects rabbits and other mammals. It does not spread from person to person but can be transmitted to humans through the skinning and cleaning of game animals, usually rabbits, through deer fly and tick bites, by eating or drinking contaminated food or water or by pets who have contracted the disease.\n\nIn Arizona, tularemia activity occurs in elevations above 3000 feet. The disease can be severe and fatal if not treated properly and immediately with antimicrobial therapy.\n\nA person infected with tularemia may show a variety of symptoms, including an ulcer or sore at the site of exposure, painful swelling of regional lymph nodes (usually in the armpit, elbow, groin, or neck area), fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and nausea. Tularemia-like symptoms appear 1 to 14 days, but usually 3 to 5 days, after skinning game, or after being bitten by deer flies or ticks. People can also develop pneumonia and may have symptoms including chest pain, bloody sputum and trouble breathing.\n\nThe Coconino County Public Health Services District recommends the following illness prevention guidelines:\n- Avoid contact with wild animals.\n- Do not handle sick or dead animals.\n- Wear protective equipment, such as gloves and mask when hunting and handling animals.\n- Protect against insect bites when hiking, camping or working outdoors. Wear insect repellent containing DEET or treat clothing with repellent containing permethrin.\n- Do not drink untreated water.\n- Avoid exposure to rodent burrows, fleas and ticks. Stay out of areas wild rodents inhabit.\n- Prevent pets from roaming loose. Pets can pick up the infected fleas or ticks from wild animals, and then pass fleas on to their human owners.

Tularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. Although tularemia is a potentially serious disease, it is treatable with common antimicrobials. The Broomfield resident has been treated after being evaluated by a health care provider and is recovering. Tularemia is not known to be spread from person to person. People become infected with tularemia by: breathing in the bacteria; contact with contaminated soil; handling infected animal carcasses; being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect; or by eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\n'In recent years, there has been a significant increase in cases believed to be the result of exposure to bacteria contaminated soil,' said Jason Vahling, Broomfield County public health director. 'People should take precautions when gardening or landscaping because when a person mows, blows leaves, or turns up the soil, the bacteria can be aerosolized and inhaled,' said Vahling.\n\nAccording to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, this is the 3rd reported human case of tularemia in Colorado in 2016, and a 4th is under investigation. In 2015, 52 cases of human tularemia were reported in Colorado, more than 10 times the typical number of 0-4 cases reported annually from 1954-2013.\n\nDepending on the exposure, symptoms may include: abrupt onset of fever, skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea, or pneumonia. Patients can also have chills, headache, muscle aches, cough, or difficulty breathing. Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure to the bacteria, but can take as long as 14 days.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The clinical manifestations of human tularemia in this case are not stated and depend on the route of entry of the organism into the body.

The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity), and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness.

The 2nd patient with tularemia in 2016 is from the province of South Holland in the Vijfheerenlanden region. This patient had no known contact with hares. The report notes that human tularemia has not been seen in the Netherlands since 2011.\n\nAlso known as rabbit fever and deer fly fever, tularemia is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. This bacterium is found in nature in rabbits, rodents, beavers, squirrels and several domestic and farm animals.\n\nPeople commonly get infected from the bites of infected ticks (wood, dog) and deer flies. Hunters are at risk of infection following skinning, dressing and eating infected animals. Drinking contaminated water has been implicated in tularemia infection. People also contract it through inhaling dust and hay that have rodent feces and carcasses. There have been cases where people got infected from a domestic cat. It is believed that cats get the organism from contaminated prey and their mouth and claws become infected. Certain animal-associated occupations are also associated with the disease: farmers, veterinarians, sheepherders and shearers.\n\nThe disease in people depends on how it is acquired. After infection, incubation can be a couple of days to weeks, with non-specific symptoms like fever, chills, headache, sore throat and diarrhea. The way the organism enters the body frequently dictates the disease and degree of systemic involvement. The 6 syndromes are ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, typhoidal and the one with the highest mortality rate, pneumonic tularemia.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food Security & Public Health, Iowa State University, Fact Sheet on Tularemia, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/tularemia.pdf:\n\n'Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect many mammals. Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Francisellaceae. A total of 4 subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. tularensis (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp. holarctica (type B) is much more widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. mediasiatica and _F. tularensis_ subsp. novicida, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed.\n\n'With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere.

Human contraction of plague is generally from flea bites, while human contraction of tularemia is from deer fly bites, Department of Health veterinarian Dr. Paul Ettestad said Mon [14 Jun 2016]. These illnesses also can be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including pets.\n\nEttestad said the contraction rate of both plague and tularemia this year 'is higher than average, but not on a record pace.' In New Mexico, plague and tularemia are more prevalent in the spring and early summer.\n\n'We are seeing recent die-offs of rabbits in several areas of New Mexico from both plague and tularemia,' Ettestad said. 'People can be exposed to plague when pets bring infected fleas back into the home, by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions, or by contact with rodents or fleas outdoors. Exposure to tularemia can occur from bites from deer flies or handling infected animals or pets which have been exposed,' he said.\n\nSymptoms of plague and tularemia in humans are similar and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, swollen lymph nodes and possible infection at the bite site, Ettestad said. Likewise, he noted, signs of plague and tularemia in cats and dogs are similar, and include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite and possible swelling in the lymph node under the jaw.\n\nThe only sure way to distinguish the difference between these is through laboratory testing, he said. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. According to statistics compiled by the Department of Health for 2015, 4 people in New Mexico contracted plague, with 1 fatality in Santa Fe County, and 8 cases of tularemia were confirmed, with no fatalities. There were also 63 confirmed cases of tularemia in dogs and cats in 2015, and 18 confirmed pet plague cases.\n\n[Byline: Rick Nathanson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Fleas and ticks are the guilty party in spreading these diseases to other animals, including our pets and us. Protecting our pets and ourselves from fleas and ticks is primary. Flea and tick collars around your ankles when hiking these areas can be helpful. For pets there are generally once-a-month treatments available that work very well.\n\nPlague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations, with some species being particularly susceptible. Free-ranging carnivores, including feral cats, are particularly exposed to plague as they prey on its reservoir.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects, aside from people, more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released. The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram-negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp.\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. - Mod.TG\n\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nSymptoms of plague and tularemia in humans are similar and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, swollen lymph nodes and possible infection at the bite site, Ettestad said.

He or she is now home recovering from the infection, which is commonly referred to as rabbit fever because of the animal that most commonly carries the bacterium.\n\nPeople can become infected by handling infected animals, through an insect bite, from contaminated food, or by the droppings or urine of a sick animal. The bacterium in the animal waste can turn to aerosol, and when people mow or turn up the soil, they can inhale the infection.\n\nHealth officials believe that is how the Fort Collins resident contracted tularemia, according to a written release. 'This person did a lot of lawn mowing and gardening,' said Katie O'Donnell, spokeswoman for the health department.\n\nTularemia varies in severity from mild illness to even death, though fatalities from the condition are rare, according to health officials. Signs of infection include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and swollen and painful lymph glands. If the condition is contracted from an insect bite, it often causes a skin ulcer and swollen glands, according to the Larimer health department. If it is contracted through food or water, it may result in a throat infection, mouth ulcers, stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Inhaling the infection can lead to chest pain and coughing. The condition can be treated with antimicrobials, so residents with these symptoms are encouraged to seek medical attention.\n\nThe frequency of human cases appears to be increasing. The Colorado Department of Health and Environment reports 94 total confirmed cases from 2005 through 2015. Of those, 52 occurred in 2015. Larimer County has 12 total reports during that same 10-year period, according to the state health department. 9 of those were in 2015, O'Donnell said.\n\nThe bacterium that causes tularemia naturally occurs in rabbits, hares, small rodents, voles, muskrats, and beavers. Therefore, any signs of these species dying off throughout a neighborhood indicate a possible outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Pamela Johnson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 17 Jun 2016\nSource: Larimer County Department of Health and Environment [edited]\nhttps://www.larimer.org/news/newsDetail.cfm?id=4243\n\n\nThe Larimer County Department of Health and Environment has confirmed the 1st human case of tularemia in a county resident in 2016. This patient developed a lung infection, and may have been exposed while mowing the yard or gardening at home in an urban subdivision. Soil can be contaminated by tularemia-causing bacteria from the droppings or urine of sick animals, most often rabbits. When a person mows, blows leaves, or turns up the soil, these bacteria can aerosolize and be inhaled, causing pneumonic tularemia.\n\nAll warm-blooded animals are susceptible to tularemia, including livestock and pets such as dogs, cats, and birds, however these bacteria normally occur in nature in rabbits and hares, as well as in small rodents, voles, muskrats, and beavers. A recent die-off of rabbits or rodents in a neighborhood suggests a possible tularemia outbreak among the animals in that area. The bacteria these animals shed can persist in the soil or water for weeks, and it takes very few bacteria to cause an infection.\n\nTularemia can be transmitted to people, such as hunters, who have handled infected animals. Infection can also arise from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies); by exposure to contaminated food, water, or soil; by eating, drinking, putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth before washing after outdoor activities; by direct contact with breaks in the skin; or by inhaling particles carrying the bacteria (through mowing or blowing vegetation and excavating soil). In recent years, most human tularemia cases along the Front Range have been attributed to activities involving soil and vegetation.\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans may include fever, chills, headache, swollen, and painful lymph glands, and fatigue. If tularemia is caused by the bite of an infected insect or from bacteria entering a cut or scratch, it usually causes a skin ulcer or pustule and swollen glands. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, mouth ulcers, stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Inhaling the bacteria may cause an infection of the lungs with chest pain and coughing.\n\nTularemia can be effectively treated with antimicrobials. Should you have any of these early signs, seek medical attention as soon as possible. Untreated tularemia can lead to hospitalization and may be fatal if not diagnosed and treated appropriately.\n\nGardeners, landscapers, mowers, outdoor workers, and others participating in leisure activities outside are advised to:\n- wear gloves when gardening or planting trees, and always wash hands before eating or putting hands to mouth, nose, or eyes;\n- wear a dust mask when mowing or blowing vegetation, or excavating or tilling soil;\n- wear an insect repellent effective against ticks, biting flies, and mosquitoes (DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 are good choices);\n- wear shoes, rather than going barefoot, on grassy lawns, especially if dead rabbits or rodents have been seen in the neighborhood;\n- never touch dead animals with bare hands\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail sincerely thanks veterinarian Dr Bob Peterson (<bpeterson@hqrllc.com>) who also contributed this report.\n\nThe state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/821.

This represents a substantial increase in the annual mean number of 4 (975 percent increase), 7 (200 percent), 7 (186 percent) and 2 (70 percent) cases, respectively, reported in each state during 2004-2014.\n\n'Patients ranged in age from 10 months to 89 years (median = 56 years); 74 were male. The most common clinical presentations of tularemia were respiratory disease (pneumonic form, [n = 26]), skin lesions with lymphadenopathy (ulceroglandular form, [n = 26]), and a general febrile illness without localizing signs (typhoidal form, [n = 25]). Overall, 48 persons were hospitalized, and 1 death was reported, in a man aged 85 years. Possible reported exposure routes included animal contact (n = 51), environmental aerosolizing activities (n = 49), and arthropod bites (n = 34); a total of 41 patients reported 2 or more possible exposures.\n\n'Although the cause for the increases in tularemia cases in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming is unclear, possible explanations might be contributing factors, including increased rainfall promoting vegetation growth, pathogen survival, and increased rodent and rabbit populations. Increased awareness and testing since tularemia was reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in January 2000 is also a possible explanation for the increase in the number of cases in these 4 states. Health care providers should be aware of the elevated risk for tularemia within these states and consider a diagnosis of tularemia in any person nationwide with compatible signs and symptoms. Residents and visitors to these areas should regularly use insect repellent, wear gloves when handling animals, and avoid mowing in areas where sick or dead animals have been reported.'\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "\n\nGardeners, landscapers, mowers, outdoor workers, and others participating in leisure activities outside are advised to:\n- wear gloves when gardening or planting trees, and always wash hands before eating or putting hands to mouth, nose, or eyes;\n- wear a dust mask when mowing or blowing vegetation, or excavating or tilling soil;\n- wear an insect repellent effective against ticks, biting flies, and mosquitoes (DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 are good choices);\n- wear shoes, rather than going barefoot, on grassy lawns, especially if dead rabbits or rodents have been seen in the neighborhood;\n- never touch dead animals with bare hands\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n Infection can also arise from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies); by exposure to contaminated food, water, or soil; by eating, drinking, putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth before washing after outdoor activities; by direct contact with breaks in the skin; or by inhaling particles carrying the bacteria (through mowing or blowing vegetation and excavating soil).

It is a disease that both people and animals can get through tick and fly bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nTularemia is rare in Minnesota, between 0 and 3 cases are identified in people and 0 to 5 cases are identified in animals annually. To date this year [2016], the 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats -- all in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metropolitan area.\n\nCats are the most commonly affected domestic animal in Minnesota; outdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at highest risk. Infected cats often have a high fever, mouth ulcers, depression, and loss of appetite. Dogs rarely show signs, but can have a skin abscess at the site of infection, loss of appetite, and fever.\n\nSigns and symptoms of tularemia in people usually involve fever, swollen lymph nodes, and skin or mouth ulcers. Tularemia is treatable with antibiotics. Symptoms may also include skin or mouth ulcers, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, cough, and weakness. It cannot be transferred person to person. People who have had contact with animals such as wild rabbits and have symptoms consistent with tularemia, should consult their healthcare provider and notify the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nAccording to Jeff Bender, DVM, MS and professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine, tularemia can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild animals, wearing gloves when picking up dead animals, and using insect repellent to reduce the chance of tick and fly bites. Cat owners are encouraged to keep their cats indoors. Outdoor cats, as in the recent cases are often hunters, and are at increased risk for tularemia.\n\nPet owners' who have concerns that their pet has been exposed, should contact their veterinarian.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram-negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram-negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of _Francisella_ has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be as high as 30 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and occurs in both the Old and New Worlds.\n\nEpidemiology and transmission\n-----------------------------\nAmong domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk because of predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, whereas cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domesticated animals. Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly). Animal hosts of _F. tularensis holarctica_ are lagomorphs, beaver, muskrat, voles, and sheep. Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western USA (for example, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.\n\nClinical findings\n-----------------\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. The most severely and commonly affected livestock species are sheep. Type A tularemia is particularly pathogenic for lagomorphs, and cats and nonhuman primates have been reported to be infected. The clinical presentation depends on host species, subspecies of the bacteria, and route of infection. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. Cats may also develop ulceroglandular or oropharyngeal disease, presumably through exposure to infected prey items. Clinical signs include increased pulse and respiratory rates, coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 per cent mortality.\n\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. The infective dose required to transmit this pathogen is extremely low; thus, risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant, and special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. In some jurisdictions, tularemia in animals is reportable to public health authorities.\n\nTreatment and control\n---------------------\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment is important to minimize risk of fatality. Because of the substantial sylvatic (wildlife and tick) component of the _Francisella_ life cycle, control is limited to reducing arthropod infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCan I get tularemia?\n--------------------\nYes. Humans can get tularemia by direct contact with infected animals, inhaling (aerosol) the bacteria in contaminated environments, eating (oral) contaminated food or water or from the bite of an infected insect (vector). Signs usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure. Disease varies depending route of exposure to the bacteria. Initially flu-like signs, such as fever, chills, nausea, headache, and joint pain occur. Glands (or lymph nodes) may become swollen and painful and may break open and drain pus.\n\nOther signs include skin rash, sore throat, or swelling of the eyes. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\nHow can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n-------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nHow can I protect myself from tularemia?\n----------------------------------------\nAvoid contact with wildlife, especially sick animals. Do not handle dead wildlife without gloves. Wash your hands after touching any animal and especially before you eat. When outside, wear insect repellents that contain DEET. Cook all meats and foods thoroughly. Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Only drink water from a safe source.\n\nIn short: Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted (borrowed from my colleague, Mod.LL).\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/tularemia/overview_of_tularemia.html and http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16848.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk.

A 2nd cat has been diagnosed with the infectious disease.\n\nTularemia, also known as 'rabbit fever,' is a naturally occurring disease found in wildlife, specifically in rabbits, squirrels, and rodents. People and animals can get the disease from fly or tick bites or contact with infected animals.\n\nThe disease is rare in Minnesota. So far this year [2016], 3 cases have been identified in a cottontail rabbit and 2 cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] metro area. Usually, zero to 5 animal cases happen annually.\n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk.

The disease was present based on observations during a necropsy performed today [28 May 2016] by ADF&G [Alaska Department of Fish and Game] wildlife veterinarian, Dr Kimberlee Beckmen. In addition, a Fairbanks veterinarian reported a suspected case of tularemia in a dog from the Chena Hot Springs area last week. The dog was found eating a hare 2 days prior to becoming severely ill with fever.\n\n'Outbreaks of tularemia in dogs and cats that come in contact with sick hares occur in the Fairbanks North Star Borough every May and June,' said Dr Beckmen, 'but this year's [2016] cases are about 2 weeks earlier than usual'. Tularemia is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in the Interior between Memorial Day [last Monday in May] and Labor Day [first Monday in September] because it is spread by ticks which are active during the summer.\n\nLast summer [2015], a North Pole man became ill after skinning an infected hare. In 2015, Colorado saw the largest outbreak in state history with 11 human cases in May alone and New Mexico also documented a significant outbreak of human cases.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed. The commonest signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by hare and squirrel ticks that have always been present on wildlife in Alaska. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. 2 species of dog ticks have become established around urban areas in Alaska and are also capable of spreading the disease.\n\nWhile tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare. Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\n'Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Do not allow your pets to roam free or have access to sick hares. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,' said Dr Beckmen.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth. Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. Double-bag and dispose of dead hares in the trash or bury where dogs and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alaska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nIt seems a bit early for the tularemia season. This article mentioned that it is only 2 weeks ahead yet there have been other earlier reports indicating there were wildlife cases.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and people. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released.\n\nEtiology\n--------\nThe causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It can be cultured readily on blood supplemented with cysteine but must be differentiated from other Gram negative bacteria on blood agar. The taxonomic status of francisella has been revised and debated, but recent consensus establishes the subspecies _F. tularensis tularensis_, associated with type A tularemia, _F. tularensis holarctica_, which causes type B tularemia, and a 3rd type, C, associated with _F. novicida_, which has low virulence and is less common than the other 2.

MJ]\n\n******\n \n\nEtiology\n Important wild animal hosts for _F. tularensis tularensis_ include cottontail and jackrabbits, whereas the most common vectors are the ticks _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey. \nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague and pseudotuberculosis) or acute pneumonia. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefer to live on hares and rodents, but will occasionally bite dogs, cats, or people. Dogs and cats that go out of doors can be treated with a veterinary product that will kill ticks within 24 hours so that disease transmission doesn't occur from ticks feeding on pets,' said Dr Beckmen. \n\n'Although cases of tularemia in humans are rare, they can be avoided by adhering to safety precautions. Among domestic animals, sheep are the commonest host, but clinical infection has also been reported in cats, dogs, pigs, and horses. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. \n\nTularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another category -------------------------------------------\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. http://www.fox9.com/news/146841554-story\n\n\nThere are now 3 confirmed animal cases of tularemia, also known as 'rabbit fever' in Minnesota, according to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. If the lungs become infected, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and severe pneumonia can occur\n\n Thoroughly wash any scratches, bites, or wounds made by pets or wildlife immediately with soap and water, and seek medical attention, especially if fever, redness, swelling or flu-like symptoms appear afterward. How can I protect my animal from tularemia?\n \n\nOutdoor cats that hunt rabbits are at the highest risk. Sheep and cats may be subclinically infected or develop bacteremia, fever, and respiratory infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted as a precaution to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. [2] Alaska: canine, lagomorph (hare)\n Ticks, flies, fleas, and exposure to contaminated water sources are all associated with transmission of this subspecies, which has also been found to persist naturally in a water-associated amoeba. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "tuberculosis", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-05-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-09-25 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-05-25 00:00:00", "2016-05-28 00:00:00", "2016-05-11 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Montana", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Fairbanks", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hot Springs", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Dakota", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Minneapolis", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "California", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Oklahoma", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mod", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Alaska", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "alaska", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3865365", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - Denmark: (HS) hare, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3865365", "date": "2015-12-15 19:56:22", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - DENMARK: (CAPITAL) HARE, OIE\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 15 Dec 2015\nSource: OIE, WAHID weekly disease information 2015; 28(51) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19353\n\n\nTularemia, Denmark\n----------------------\nInformation received on 15 Dec 2015 from Dr Per Starcke Henriksen, Chief Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Glostrup, Denmark\n\nSummary\nReport type: Immediate notification (Final report)\nDate of start of the event: 17 Nov 2015\nDate of confirmation of the event: 11 Dec 2015\nReason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 23 Nov 2012\nManifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: _Francisella tularensis_\nNature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)\nThis event pertains to the whole country.\n\nSummary of outbreaks\nTotal outbreaks: 1\n\nOutbreak 1: Almindingen, Bornholm, East\nDate of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2015\nOutbreak status: Resolved (11 Dec 2015)\nEpidemiological unit: Forest\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\nBrown hare (European hare): Leporidae (_Lepus europaeus_) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0\n\nAffected population: A wild European hare found dead near Ekkodalen in Almindingen on Bornholm.\n\nEpidemiology\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive\n\nEpidemiological comments: In relation to tularemia, Denmark is assumed to be a low endemic area of _F. tularensis holarctica_ (type B).

Four subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. tularensis (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp. holarctica (type B) is much more widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. mediasiatica and _F. tularensis_ subsp. novicida, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed.\n\nWith rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa. A single human case, caused by _F. tularensis novicida_, was acquired in Australia.\n\n_F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.\n\nHumans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass.

Officials at the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department are urging people to take precautions to avoid contracting the disease.\n\nThe disease causes symptoms that range from sore throat to diarrhea, and swollen and painful lymph glands. If the bacteria are inhaled, people can suffer chills, headaches, joint pain and pneumonia.\n\nAn unusually high number of cases have occurred in Wyoming this year. So far in 2015, 16 cases have been reported in Wyoming, well above the state's average of 1 or 2 cases a year. A man from Big Horn County died from the disease.\n\nThe unidentified Laramie County man was diagnosed with tularemia in the last week or so, according to Kim Deti, spokeswoman for the Wyoming Department of Health. She wrote in an email Wednesday, 23 Sep 2015, that she did not know the man's medical condition, but she did not think he was hospitalized.\n\nHigher numbers of cases of the disease have been reported in Colorado too. In Weld County, Colorado, 5 people have been infected with the disease so far in 2015, according to Eric Aakko, public information officer for Weld County's Department of Public Health and Environment. No one in the county has died from it, he wrote. The county typically sees zero cases or one case a year.\n\nThe local health department wants people to be alert, deputy director of City-County Health Gary Hickman said. He also is the director of the agency's environmental health division. '(Tularemia) is around all the time,' Hickman said. The disease has a tendency to peak when rodent populations are up, which is what has happened this year. 'We are in a big year with rodent populations,' he said.\n\nTularemia, also called rabbit fever and deer fly fever, often affects rabbits, hares and rodents. It has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs. People can get tularemia if they are bitten by infected ticks, deer flies or horseflies. The disease can be transmitted if people handle infected animals, through ingestion, contact with untreated and contaminated water, or with meat that is not properly cooked, the city-county agency's release said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Nebraska\nDate: Fri 18 Sep 2015\nSource: Beatrice Daily Sun [edited]\nhttp://beatricedailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/state-seeing-increase-in-tularemia-cases/article_2dfdd5c9-8c0d-53d6-af60-853243df9207.html\n\n\nIn 2015, a disease called tularemia has been widely reported in Nebraska and neighboring states. 18 cases have been reported to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services so far in 2015 which represents a 25-year high.

It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, insects, soil and water. Rabbits, rodents and hares are especially susceptible. Tularemia can be transmitted to people through insect bites, skin contact, contaminated food or water, or inhaling contaminated particles.\n\nTularemia can cause a wide range of symptoms including certain flu-like symptoms, an open sore and swelling at the site of a tick bite or swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms usually appear 3-5 days after exposure to the bacteria, but can take up to 14 days to appear.

This is the 1st human case of tularemia in the Sudbury and District Health Unit's service area since 2003, said a press release. It is believed that the individual became infected through contact with wild game.\n\nTularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. It is naturally occurring in Ontario wildlife populations, especially in rabbits, hares, voles, muskrats, beavers, and squirrels and in ticks and small domestic animals.\n\nHumans can become infected through several routes, including:\n- bites or licks of an infected animal\n- handling or cleaning the carcass of an infected animal, especially the skin or meat\n- eating inadequately cooked wild game\n- inhalation or exposure beneath the skin to contaminated soil\n- drinking contaminated water\n- bites of an infected tick or deer fly\n\nHunters are at higher risk of exposure because of the handling of wild game carcasses.

It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States, an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation, as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as acanthamoeba), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In 1 case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of 1 to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity), and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29468.]", "summary": "\n\nHumans can become infected through several routes, including:\n- bites or licks of an infected animal\n- handling or cleaning the carcass of an infected animal, especially the skin or meat\n- eating inadequately cooked wild game\n- inhalation or exposure beneath the skin to contaminated soil\n- drinking contaminated water\n- bites of an infected tick or deer fly\n\nHunters are at higher risk of exposure because of the handling of wild game carcasses. \n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation, as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as acanthamoeba), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection in this case are not stated nor is the animal suspected to be the reservoir.

It is caused by a bacterium found in animals (especially rodents, rabbits and hares), and is passed to both domestic animals and people.\n\n'It's not unusual to see 1-2 cases of tularemia in animals annually in Yavapai County. The state only averages one human case of tularemia per year,' says Stephen Everett, Epidemiologist for Yavapai County Community Health Services (YCCHS).\n\nPeople and pets who spend time outdoors can contract tularemia if they are bitten by infected deerflies, ticks, or other insects, or by handling infected rodents or rabbits. Family pets with outdoor roaming privileges can carry ticks into the home and may expose humans to tick-borne illnesses. Rarely, tularemia can spread to humans through contaminated food or water or by inhaling the airborne organism. It is not known to spread from person to person.\n\n[Byline: David McAtee]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley\n\n['The causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has also been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from 1 life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

Some years, such as in 2012 and now 2015, there is a larger outbreak of disease in hares and humans, usually late in the summer season.\n\nSince July this year [2015], an unusually high number of dead mountain hares (_Lepus timidus_) have been noted in the coastal area of northern Sweden, in the counties of Norrbotten and Vasterbotten. In the past month, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (http://www.sva.se) has received over 120 reports of single or multiple dead hares from this area, with a focus around the city of Lulea [map at http://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/europe/sweden/].\n\nTen hares submitted so far to SVA from the area were all positive for tularemia in the PCR-analysis. A high number of human cases of tularemia have also been registered in the same region (ref. Public Health Agency of Sweden).\n\nSVA performs wildlife disease surveillance and has research projects regarding tularemia in wildlife, so the public is encouraged to report sick or dead hares or rodents to SVA. Also, in neighboring areas of northern Finland (Uleaborg area), the veterinary institute EVIRA reports many cases of tularemia (http://www.evira.fi).\n\n--\nErik Agren\nVeterinary Officer, Department of Pathology and Wildlife Diseases, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden\n<erik.agren@sva.se>\n\n[According to Sweden's reports to the OIE, the most recent outbreak of tularemia in domestic animals (rabbits) was recorded in 2006. No information on infections in wild animals (hares) has been reported in the annual reports to the OIE.\n\nDuring the last 5 years, tularemia has been ranked 3rd among the 10 zoonoses diagnosed in humans, as reported to the OIE, with the following figures (human cases):\n2010 - 484; 2011 - 350; 2012 - 590; 2013 - 118; 2014 - 150.\n\nThe full list of zoonoses in Sweden for 2014 is presented for comparative assessment (no deaths reported in 2014):\n\nCampylobacteriosis - 8288\nSalmonellosis - 2213\nTularemia - 150\nListeriosis - 125\n_Escherichia coli_ O157 - 56\nEchinococcosis/hydatidosis - 21\nBrucellosis - 16\nAvian chlamydiosis - 12\nLeptospirosis - 6\nQ fever - 2\nTrichinellosis - 1\nBotulism - 1\n\nThe following [edited] summary on tularemia in animals is derived from OIE's manual (chapter 2.1.18, updated 2008):\n\n'Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by _Francisella tularensis_. The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 C [98.6 F]. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.\n\nTwo types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs [rabbits & hares] in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _Francisella tularensis subsp. palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia. It may be water- or arthropod-borne, is less virulent to humans and rabbits, and does not ferment glycerol.\n\nIn addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites, by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.\n\nThe disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes. On post-mortem examination, lesions may include caseous necrosis of lymph nodes and multiple greyish-white foci of necrosis in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and lungs. The spleen is usually enlarged. It is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism. Special precautions, including the wearing of gloves, masks and eyeshields are, therefore, recommended when handling infective materials. The facility should meet the requirements for Containment Group 3 pathogens.'\n\nWe are grateful to Dr Agren for the submission of the current information from North Sweden. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/108.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Trichinellosis - 1\nBotulism - 1\n\nThe following [edited] summary on tularemia in animals is derived from OIE's manual (chapter 2.1.18, updated 2008):\n\n'Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by _Francisella tularensis_. \n\nDuring the last 5 years, tularemia has been ranked 3rd among the 10 zoonoses diagnosed in humans, as reported to the OIE, with the following figures (human cases):\n2010 - 484; 2011 - 350; 2012 - 590; 2013 - 118; 2014 - 150.

Approximately 125 cases have been reported annually in the USA during the last 2 decades (2). As of 30 Sep 2015, a total of 100 tularemia cases were reported in 2015 among residents of Colorado (n = 43), Nebraska (n = 21), South Dakota (n = 20), and Wyoming (n = 16) (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). This represents a substantial increase in the annual mean number of 4 (975 percent increase), 7 (200 percent), 7 (186 percent) and 2 (70 percent) cases, respectively, reported in each state during 2004-2014 (2).\n\nPatients ranged in age from 10 months to 89 years (median = 56 years); 74 were male. The most common clinical presentations of tularemia were respiratory disease (pneumonic form, [n = 26]), skin lesions with lymphadenopathy (ulceroglandular form, [n = 26]), and a general febrile illness without localizing signs (typhoidal form, [n = 25]). Overall, 48 persons were hospitalized, and 1 death was reported, in a man aged 85 years. Possible reported exposure routes included animal contact (n = 51), environmental aerosolizing activities (n = 49), and arthropod bites (n = 34); a total of 41 patients reported 2 or more possible exposures.\n\nClinical presentation and severity of tularemia depends on the strain, inoculation route, and infectious dose. Tularemia can be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals (e.g., rabbits or cats); ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; inhalation from aerosolization (e.g., landscaping, mowing over voles, hares, and rodents, or other farming activities); or arthropod bites (e.g., ticks or deer flies) (1,3). Human-to-human transmission has never been demonstrated (1,3).\n\nInfected persons can develop a range of symptoms that display several clinical forms. These include fever and chills with muscle and joint pain (typhoidal), cough or difficulty breathing (pneumonic), swollen lymph nodes with or without skin lesions (ulceroglandular or glandular), conjunctivitis (oculoglandular), pharyngitis (oropharyngeal), or abdominal pain with vomiting and diarrhea (intestinal) (2,3). Symptoms typically begin within 3-5 days of exposure, but can take up to 14 days to appear. Case fatality rates range from less to 2 percent to 24 percent, depending on the strain (1-3). Streptomycin is considered the drug of choice on the basis of historical use and Food and Drug Administration approval; however, it sometimes can be difficult to obtain and is associated with frequent ototoxicity (3). Gentamicin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin are also used (2,3).\n\n_F. tularensis_ is commonly isolated in culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction from patients' blood specimens, but can also be identified in specimens from skin lesions, spinal fluid, lymph nodes, and respiratory secretions (2). In addition, a serologic diagnosis can be made by demonstrating a fourfold increase between immunoglobulin G titers from patients in the acute and convalescent stages of infection. Specimens suspected of containing _F. tularensis_ should be handled at biosafety level 2 at a minimum. Biosafety level 3 containment is recommended when handling live cultures (2,3).\n\nAlthough the cause for the increases in tularemia cases in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming is unclear, possible explanations might be contributing factors, including increased rainfall promoting vegetation growth, pathogen survival, and increased rodent and rabbit populations. Increased awareness and testing since tularemia was reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in January 2000 is also a possible explanation for the increase in the number of cases in these 4 states (4). Health care providers should be aware of the elevated risk for tularemia within these states* and consider a diagnosis of tularemia in any person nationwide with compatible signs and symptoms. Residents and visitors to these areas should regularly use insect repellent, wear gloves when handling animals, and avoid mowing in areas where sick or dead animals have been reported.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The rabbits didn't have contact with any people.\n[Apart from those who picked them up for testing. - Mod.JW]\n\nThey were found in the Pueblo West area on the following streets [i.e., in the city of Pueblo, in Pueblo County]:\nLinden Avenue\nKirkwood Drive\nSiesta Drive\nSpalding Avenue\nBeardsley Place.\n\nThe Pueblo Health Department says there have been widespread die-offs throughout Pueblo West. They're advising everyone in the area.\n\nRabbit fever is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by handling sick or dead animals what are infected. People can also get it if they are bitten by an infected insect.\n\nHere's important information the Pueblo County Health Department shared.\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics, therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows signs of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\n\nRecommended precautions include:\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\n- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.\n- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.\n- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.\n\nIf you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps:\n- Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits.\n- Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165 deg F or higher.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has also been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from 1 life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

Two of the rabbits were sent to the Game and Fish's Wildlife Diseases Laboratory, and both tested positive for tularemia.\n\nTularemia is fairly common in rodents and rabbits and occasionally spills over into other host species, including humans. It occurs almost every year somewhere in Wyoming but is not cause for alarm. Wheatland Game Warden David Ellsworth said that like most other wildlife diseases, tularemia is more likely to occur during periods of high populations, which cottontail rabbits are experiencing now.\n\nAccording to the Wyoming Department of Health, humans typically become infected through the bites of ticks and deerflies but may also become infected by handling infected animal carcasses, eating or drinking contaminated food or water, or by inhaling infected aerosols. Dogs and cats can also contract tularemia by eating infected animals, drinking contaminated water or through tick and deer fly bites. With small game seasons coming up in the fall, Ellsworth cautions hunters to avoid harvesting rabbits that appear sick, use gloves when handling harvested game, and cook game thoroughly before consumption. Tularemia is active during periods of warm weather when insect vectors are present, but the disease generally dies off after a hard frost.\n\nTularemia epidemics are not uncommon and may result in extensive rabbit mortalities, but most cases involve just a few to several deaths in isolated populations.\n\nSeveral dead prairie dogs and other rodents at Devil's Tower National Monument have also tested positive for tularemia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the affected area can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/awKC. - Mod.PMB\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/251.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n According to the Wyoming Department of Health, humans typically become infected through the bites of ticks and deerflies but may also become infected by handling infected animal carcasses, eating or drinking contaminated food or water, or by inhaling infected aerosols.

'Tularemia is a fairly uncommon but potentially severe disease that can be fatal,' said Dr. Lon Kightlinger, state epidemiologist for the Department of Health. 'People can be exposed when they come in contact with infected insects and animals, particularly rabbits, rodents and cats.'\n\n6 of South Dakota's cases were adults over the age of 50 and 1 was a child under 5. 5 of the 7 were hospitalized. Kightlinger noted that 1 of the cases had direct contact with a pet cat that tested positive for tularemia.\n\nSometimes called rabbit fever, tularemia most commonly results in a sore developing where the bacteria enter the body, accompanied by swelling of the lymph nodes. In severe cases, it can cause fever and a pneumonia-like illness, which can be fatal.\n\nTo reduce the risk of tularemia, Kightlinger encouraged people to use insect repellants when outside with animals and to take precautions such as wearing gloves and double-bagging when handling and disposing of dead animals. Animal owners, particularly cat owners, should watch their animals for signs of illness and contact their veterinarian as soon as possible if unusual signs develop. Using tick and insect repellants on pets and livestock also helps prevent transmission of tularemia and other vector-borne diseases. Cat owners should consult their veterinarians about appropriate repellants as some labeled for use on dogs may be toxic for cats.\n\n'Especially during this season of camping and outdoor recreation, people, including Rally-goers, should avoid or take special precautions with rabbits, prairie dogs, gophers and voles,' said Kightlinger.\n\nOther states in the region, including North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado are also reporting increased cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.\n\nTularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats.

In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease.

This does not mark an outbreak in Alaska, but some states in the Lower 48 are seeing multiple cases this year [2015].\n\nThis is the 1st human case in Alaska since 2009, although there have been cases of hares diagnosed with the disease in recent years. Tularemia occurs sporadically in Alaska, and this marks the 30th case in 70 years. Interior Alaska accounts for about half the total cases, and Southeast Alaska has seen only 1 case.\n\nTularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. The disease has been documented for thousands of years under a variety of names, but the tularemia bacterium was identified by American pathologists in 1912 and named for Tulare County, California. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed.\n\nThe most common signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes. Most human infections become apparent after 3 to 5 days.\n\nHares are the primary host and the disease is spread by ticks. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefers to live on hares, but will occasionally bite pets or people. It is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in Interior Alaska between Memorial Day [last Monday of May] and Labor Day [1st Monday in September] because the ticks are active during the summer.\n\nAlthough tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare.\n\nInterior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.\n\nIn June 2009, a Fairbanks woman wrestled with her dog to take a dead hare from its mouth. She had a splinter in her right index finger and it became infected with the bacteria. A lesion developed a few days later. Within a week she developed a fever of 104 [deg F; 40 deg C] and she was in and out of the hospital for almost a month. A 2nd case was reported the same month -- also a woman who developed a skin lesion after her dog brought home a dead hare.\n\nIf your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash your hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth.\n\n[Byline: Riley Woodford]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.\n\nTularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America.

According to their press release, tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease associated with various animal species. It frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs.\n\nHumans can be infected with the bacteria through many different sources including through the bite of an infected insect, usually a tick or deerfly, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or by inhalation of the bacteria.

'Tularemia is always a concern but is not common. To see this activity is concerning.'\n\nMurphy said tularemia can be a serious disease and, in rare cases, deadly. Tularemia symptoms can include fever, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, skin ulcers and diarrhea. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough and progressive weakness and pneumonia.\n\nRecommendations to help avoid tick-related diseases include:\n- Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to see ticks crawling on clothing.\n- Tuck pant legs into socks.\n- Apply insect repellents such as those containing 20 percent or more DEET and/or picaradin.\n- Upon return from potentially tick-infested areas, search self and children for ticks and remove if found.\n- Check pets for ticks; use tick control products recommended by veterinarians.\n\nAdded precautions to help reduce tularemia risk include:\n- Avoid bathing, swimming or working in untreated water and avoid drinking untreated water.\n- Avoid handling rabbits, squirrels or other animals that appear sick.\n- Wear rubber gloves when skinning animals, especially rabbits and squirrels; skin animals in a well-ventilated area.\n- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling sick or dead animals.\n- Cook meat thoroughly before eating, especially rabbit and squirrel.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the latest report on tularemia in the USA (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/state.html), between 2004 and 2013 Wyoming reported no more than 4 human cases per year.\n\nTularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter.

The health status of the 3 individuals is not known.\n\nIn addition, 2 North Dakota zoos have reported tularemia in animals. A squirrel from the Roosevelt Zoo in Minot tested positive, while 2 primates from the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck contracted the disease. Zoo officials are taking precautions to protect their animals, staff and visitors from the disease. Visiting a zoo does not pose an increased risk to the general public. However, people are advised to follow guidelines posted by the zoo against touching animals, and to avoid direct contact with wild animals, such as rabbits and rodents, which are known carriers of tularemia.\n\nTularemia, also known as 'rabbit fever' or 'deer fly fever,' frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs. People may acquire tularemia when bit by infected ticks, deer flies or horse flies. It can also be transmitted by handling infected animals, or through ingestion or contact with untreated, contaminated water or insufficiently cooked meat.\n\nThe symptoms of tularemia in humans vary depending on how the infection was acquired, and generally appear 1 to 14 days after exposure. 'Symptoms of tularemia may include fever, chills, headache, muscle ache, diarrhea, sore throat and cough. When a person is bitten by an infected tick or deer fly or handles an infected animal, an ulcer may appear where the bacteria entered the skin, and lymph nodes may also become swollen and painful,' said Laura Cronquist, epidemiologist with the NDDoH (North Dakota Department of Health).

The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms.\n\nThe causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

The case was confirmed at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division. 2 earlier cases of tularemia were reported in a 39-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman from Bernalillo County. They have also recovered. The Department suspects the 3 individuals in Bernalillo County contracted tularemia through deer fly bites.\n\nAnother 3 cases in the state occurred in a 35-year-old woman from Sandoval County, a 59-year-old woman from San Juan County who was bitten by her infected cat, and a 51-year-old man from Los Alamos County. These individuals were hospitalized but have recovered. There have also been 43 cases of tularemia in 2015 in dogs and cats, with pets from Bernalillo, Los Alamos, Santa Fe, Taos, and Torrance counties.\n\n'Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets so I would encourage people around the state to follow precautions similar to reducing risk to plague,' said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. 'People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals such as rabbits or rodents or are bitten by infected ticks or deer flies.'\n\nTularemia is a potentially serious illness in people that occurs in many parts of the USA. It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits, and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick and they can give the disease to people. Other possible, but much less likely, exposures are through contact with infected soil or water or by inhaling the bacterium.\n\nSymptoms of tularemia in people usually develop 3 to 5 days after exposure but onset can vary from one to 14 days. Tularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscles aches, and joint pain. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.\n\n'The rabbit population has increased dramatically in many areas of the state this summer [2015] due to abundant rainfall and vegetation, and a lot of them have been getting sick and dying from tularemia,' said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. 'This has led to an increase in both human and pet cases of tularemia with various types of exposures, including bites from infected insects, bites from infected cats, handling of infected rabbit carcasses, etc.'\n\n'The City of Albuquerque maintains a surveillance program for tularemia in wild animals,' said Dr Paul Smith, Manager of the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department Urban Biology Division. 'We encourage people to report dead animals that have not died from obvious trauma by calling 311 so that we can collect them for testing.'\n\nIn 2014 there were 5 human cases of tularemia in New Mexico, a 65-year-old woman from Bernalillo County, a 78-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman both from San Juan County, a 66-year-old man from Lincoln County, and a 69-year-old woman from Sandoval County.

'Tularemia is always a concern but is not common. To see this activity is concerning.'\n\nLaegreid said his office has not received any other confirmed cases in Washakie County, regarding domestic and wild animals. 'Historically it's been around but there have been none in the past 5 years,' Mandy Thoet, veterinarian at Cloud Peak Veterinary Services in Worland, said. 'It is zoonotic (can pass to humans), that's why there is a concern,' she said.\n\nEcho Study of Tharp Veterinary Clinic in Worland said the cat that tested positive was treated at the clinic and was from Ten Sleep.

Tularemia is a bacterial infection that can spread to humans who handle hares or other animals or through dogs or cats that come into contact with infected ticks or by aerosol. Human cases of tularemia are increased this summer of 2015 in Colorado with 11 cases, the largest number in state history to this point of the year. New Mexico also reported human tularemia cases this year. In the North Pole case, the man became sick after skinning a hare.\n\nAccording to the CDC, human tularemia cases in the USA were reported twice as often in the 1950s than in recent years. Between 1990 and 2013, the most recent year with data available, there were fewer than 200 reported human cases per year. In humans, tularemia usually causes a fever, which can be as high as 104 degrees. Other symptoms can include a skin ulcer at the site of the infection and swollen lymph glands.\n\nIn hares, signs of tularemia include slow movement, which makes the hares easier for pets to catch. Infected hares sometimes have enlarged spleen and livers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_ , is a non-sporulating, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 percent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [extraordinary daytime urinary frequency] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. In this case, it is expected that the person had ulceroglandular tularemia after introduction of the bacterium into an obvious or subtle skin cut. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/206.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease.

The organism commonly occurs in rabbits and rodents, and can kill large numbers of rabbits quickly, authorities said.\n\nHuman symptoms include chills, fever, severe headache, and occasionally skin lesions. Disease transmission can occur from the bite of an infected tick or deer fly, or from close contact with an infected [animal].\n\n'The rain and increased vegetation we have seen over the last several months has provided extra food and harborage for rodent and rabbit populations,' said Dr Paul Smith, a manager for the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, in a statement. 'A larger number of rodents and rabbits often leads to more occurrences of both tularemia and plague.'\n\nThere have been no human cases of plague or tularemia so far in Bernalillo County in 2015, [but] 5 dogs and 1 rabbit have been confirmed with tularemia infection.\n\n'Dogs and cats can become infected with plague and tularemia through hunting rodents and rabbits or by exposure to their fleas or ticks.' said Dr Mark DiMenna, Deputy Director for the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department. 'People are often exposed when their pets bring these infected fleas or ticks into the house or through direct contact with the sick or dead rodent.'\n\nAuthorities offered the following tips to reduce the risk of plague and tularemia:\n- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting\n- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea and tick control product on your pets\n- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles\n- Don't allow children or others to handle sick or dead wildlife\n- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian\n- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever\n- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home\n- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it\n- Avoid mowing over dead animals\n- Bernalillo County citizens living east of Tramway Blvd. should report sick or dead rodents and rabbits to 311. Rodents or rabbits with obvious signs of injury (gunshot wounds, bite wounds, etc.) do not need to be reported.\n\nFor more information about plague and tularemia visit the Environmental Health website at http://www.cabq.gov/environmentalhealth/urban-biology\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6643.

Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.\n\nControl is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.\n\nUse of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

The victim, who lives in northern Larimer County, was infected while planting trees or gardening. Soil can be contaminated by bacteria from the droppings or urine of sick animals and bacteria can enter the skin through tiny cuts or abrasions, according to the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment.\n\nOfficials said there's been a recent die-off of rabbits in the neighborhood, which suggests a possible tularemia outbreak among the animals in that area. 'These bacteria can persist in the soil or water for weeks, and it takes very few bacteria to cause an infection,' Katie O'Donnell said in a news release to the community.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, residents in Larimer, Broomfield, Weld and Boulder counties were diagnosed with tularemia.\n\n[byline: Deb Stanley]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Colorado saw 15 human cases of tularemia reported in 2014, 5 times the annual average for the state. Tularemia-related small-mammal die-offs were reported in at least 27 Colorado counties.\n\nThe manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection are not stated.\n\nTularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States, an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation, as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as acanthamoeba), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of 1 to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza [inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity], and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur.

'Historically, we see cases of tularemia in hunters, and the disease is so widespread in 2014, we want to make sure our hunters understand the risks.'\n\n'In the last 10 years Colorado has averaged 3 human cases of tularemia a year,' Dr. House said. 'So far in 2014 we have had 11, and additional suspected cases are under investigation.'\n\nLocal health departments have received numerous reports of rabbit and rodent die-offs across the state in 2014. Animals from 12 counties tested positive for tularemia, a bacterial disease that can affect small game animals. It commonly causes illness and death in rabbits and rodents such as squirrels. People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals or are bitten by ticks or deer flies.\n\nPeople also can be exposed to tularemia by touching contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water or inhaling bacteria. Hunters are most at risk when skinning game and preparing and consuming the meat.\n\nHunters should:\n- Harvest only small game that looks and acts healthy. Beware of lazy rabbits!\n- Avoid hunting in areas where dead small game has been found.\n- Wear gloves when handling small game animals, and wash your hands after removing your gloves.\n- Cook all game meat thoroughly to 160-170 F.\n- Notify your public health department or local wildlife office if you notice sick or dead rabbits or rodents.\n- Symptoms of tularemia include abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, vomiting, dry cough and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms are skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or pneumonia. Tularemia often is overlooked as a diagnosis because it is rare, and the symptoms are similar to other diseases. 9/11 people infected with tularemia this year were hospitalized for treatment.\n- Anyone who becomes ill after exposure to a sick or dead animal, or after spending time in areas where sick or dead wild animals have been seen, should talk to a health care provider about the possibility of tularemia.\n- Tularemia is treatable with antibiotics.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares.

Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially [Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. - CopyEd.MSP], which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress [skin], prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people.

MMWR 2013; 62(47); 963-6 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6247a5.htm) indicate that a total of 1208 cases of tularemia were reported during 2001-2010. The median number of cases per year was 126.5, with a range of 90-154 cases per year. Of these 1208 reported cases, 64 percent were categorized as confirmed and 35 percent as probable. Median age of patients was 39 years (range: 1-92 years), and 68 percent were male. Average annual incidence was 0.041 cases per 100 000 persons. By age group and sex, annual incidence was highest among children aged 5-9 years (0.071) and among men aged 65-69 years (0.11). Cases were reported from 47 states. Six states accounted for 59 percent of reported cases: Missouri (19 percent), Arkansas (13 percent), Oklahoma (9 percent), Massachusetts (7 percent), South Dakota (5 percent), and Kansas (5 percent). Among the 10 states with the highest incidence of tularemia, all but Massachusetts were located in the central or western USA. Certain strains of _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies _tularensis_ (also known as type A) are associated with more severe disease and a greater risk for death. Mortality is less than 2 percent overall but ranges up to 24 percent depending on the strain.\n\nAs a category A bioterrorism agent, despite not being transmissible from person-to-person, in a fact sheet on tularemia (http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/tularemia/tularemia.html), WHO has estimated that 50 kg (110 lb) of tularemia bacteria released into the air over a city of 5 million people would cause very serious problems. WHO believes such an attack would cause about 250 000 cases of severe illness, and 19 000 deaths, a case fatality rate of about 7 percent.\n\nMortality is highest related to primary pneumonic disease or septicemia (typhoidal) with secondary pneumonia presentations, and a state such as Illinois with a low incidence of disease might contribute to mortality as it may not be considered early. - Mod.LL]\n\n[In domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant.

Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia, where the organism circulates between arthropod vectors and various mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the southcentral and western USA (eg, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods.

In sheep and most mammals, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nLesions\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Enlargement of the liver, spleen, lung, and lymph nodes is common. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. Risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant; special procedures and facilities are essential.\n\nDiagnosis\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis (see Tick Paralysis) should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted in order to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection.\n\nTreatment and Control\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment should prevent death loss. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Efforts are currently underway to develop a safe and effective vaccine.

In sheep and most mammals, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. \n\nNatural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia, where the organism circulates between arthropod vectors and various mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (eg, cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted in order to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1208-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Summit County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tularemia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oklahoma", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Kansas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Arkansas", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Montana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Dakota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2798680", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - USA (07): (CO)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2798680", "date": "2014-09-23 19:38:28", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA (07): (COLORADO)\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 23 Sep 2014\nSource: 7 News Denver [edited]\nhttp://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/tularemia-spreads-to-4th-colorado-country-now-in-weld-boulder-broomfield-and-larimer-counties\n\n\nTularemia, also known as rabbit fever, has spread to a 4th Colorado county.

He's believed to have been exposed to tularemia at a family picnic after he was bitten by a tick. He was taken to Children's Hospital with a high fever and put on antibiotics. 'It [the temperature] got higher and higher so I took him in to the ER and once I got there they basically told me, 'Your baby's really sick and he's not leaving.

There are usually only 4 cases a year in Colorado but that has quadrupled in 2014 because heavy rain has fueled vegetation and given rabbits more places to live.

Humans can also get infected if they are bit by an infected tick or deer fly, by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, and by inhaling airborne bacteria.\n\nThe Larimer County Department of Health and Environment issued an alert to residents of Hahn Acres, Linden Park, Paragon Estates, and homes in the Paragon Point subdivision along Southridge Greens Blvd. after a wild rabbit was found with tularemia.\n\n'There has been a die-off of rabbits in the area over the past few weeks, but until an animal was tested today, the cause of the die-off was unknown,' officials said.\n\nTypical signs of infection in humans are fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Eating or drinking food or water containing the bacteria may produce a throat infection, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Officials said tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics.\n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows symptoms of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to the veterinarian promptly.\n\n[Byline: Deb Stanley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially [Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. - CopyEd.MSP], which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/52400.htm.\n\nColorado may be located on the interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1298 - Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. \n\nHealth officials said tularemia is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by the handling of sick or dead animals infected with tularemia. \n\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites.

The woman was hospitalized but has recovered and gone home. 'We will be following up with a case investigation later this week in an effort to prevent future infections,' says Dr. Paul Smith, Urban Biology Division manager for the City of Albuquerque's Environmental Health Department.\n\nThere have also been 7 pet cases of tularemia in 2014, 4 dogs and 3 cats from Santa Fe, Bernalillo, and Los Alamos counties.\n\n'Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets, so I would encourage people around the state to follow precautions similar to reducing risk to plague,' said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. 'Don't handle sick or dead rodents; don't allow pets to roam and hunt; get an appropriate tick and flea control product for pets, and take sick pets to a veterinarian. Since tularemia can be fatal in a small percentage of cases, it should be treated with antibiotics following an evaluation by a physician.'\n\nTularemia is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick, and they can give the disease to people. Symptoms of tularemia in people usually develop 3 to 5 days after exposure, but onset can vary from 1-14 days.\n\nTularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection, including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscle aches and joint pain. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria, and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.\n\n'Many areas of the state have seen a large increase in the rabbit population this year [2014], and now some of those rabbits are getting sick and dying from both tularemia and plague,' said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. 'Oftentimes, there is a rabbit or rodent die off in an area due to tularemia, and deer flies or ticks can become infected from these animals and then pass it on to pets or people when they bite them.'\n\nPeople can get tularemia in different ways: handling infected animal carcasses; being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect; eating or drinking contaminated food or water or by breathing in the bacteria. Dogs and cats are usually exposed to tularemia when they are allowed to roam and hunt sick rodents and rabbits or when bitten by an infected tick.\n\nIn 2013, there were 4 human cases of tularemia identified in New Mexico, a 45-year-old man from Santa Fe County, an 88-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 62-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, and a 75-year-old woman from San Juan County. Three of the human cases were hospitalized, and all recovered.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection and the potential source of the infection are not stated.\n\nTularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States, an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness.\n\nThe number of reported cases of tularemia in the USA as reported by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/year.html) has dropped from over 900 cases in 1950 to about 100 cases per year over the past 2 decades, although in the early 1980s, there was a several-year blip of numbers around 300.\n\nState-specific statistics from CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/state.html) for 2001-2010 report a total of 55 cases from New Mexico for an average of 2.2 per year. The highest number in a year was 7. During the decade 2003-2012, the states with the most cases were Missouri (236), Arkansas (198), and Oklahoma (123). - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233.]", "summary": "\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols.

In 2013, there were 4 human cases of tularemia identified in New Mexico, a 45-year-old man from Santa Fe County, an 88-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 62-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, and a 75-year-old woman from San Juan County. The number of reported cases of tularemia in the USA as reported by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/year.html) has dropped from over 900 cases in 1950 to about 100 cases per year over the past 2 decades, although in the early 1980s, there was a several-year blip of numbers around 300. \n\n'Many areas of the state have seen a large increase in the rabbit population this year [2014], and now some of those rabbits are getting sick and dying from both tularemia and plague,' said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian.

' \n\nThere have also been 7 pet cases of tularemia in 2014, 4 dogs and 3 cats from Santa Fe, Bernalillo, and Los Alamos counties. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria, and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat. \n\nTularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection, including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscle aches and joint pain. Dogs and cats are usually exposed to tularemia when they are allowed to roam and hunt sick rodents and rabbits or when bitten by an infected tick. \n\nTularemia is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares. The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [10 Jul 2014] a laboratory confirmed case of tularemia in a 65-year-old woman from Bernalillo County. \n\nState-specific statistics from CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/state.html) for 2001-2010 report a total of 55 cases from New Mexico for an average of 2.2 per year.

The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, 0.2-0.5 micrometre x 0.7-1.0 micrometre, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 degrees C. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.\n\nTwo types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.\n\nThe disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes.\n\nIt is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism. For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2012, Chapter 2.1.18 'Tularemia' at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_TULAREMIA.pdf\n(adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).\n\nOIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to tularemia are spelled out in chapter 8.15 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.15.htm.\n\nAccording to the most recent 6-month OIE report, tularemia was reported as present in 6 countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, and Switzerland). In addition, Spain and the United States have reported the disease limited to certain zones. In 82 countries the disease has never been reported, and in 40 the disease was reported absent in this period. On the other hand, most countries have not specified surveillance for tularemia, some maintain 'general surveillance' and very few maintain 'targeted surveillance' countries (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).\n\nA map showing the distribution of disease in domestic and/or wild species can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseasedistributionmap. (Note: at both WAHID links, to view the information on tularemia, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).\n\nAlthough Tularemia had not been reported in the Netherlands since 1953, this event should not come as a surprise since the disease is present in the surrounding countries such as Germany, France and Belgium. The Dutch province of Limburg is situated in south Netherlands, bordering Germany and Belgium. The Dutch source 'Groene Ruimte', cited at the end of the commentary, says: 'The bacterium has been recently demonstrated in 3 percent of hares found dead in northern Germany. It is spread over France. The last case in Belgium, a hare, was reported in 2011' (http://www.groeneruimte.nl/nieuws/artikel.html?id=151747). - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/8l5l.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Outbreak statistics:\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nBrown hare (European hare): Leporidae (_Lepus europaeus_) / ** / ** / 100 percent / **\n No other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\nCentral Veterinary Institute (CVI), Lelystad (national laboratory) / Brown hare (European hare) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 4 Sep 2013/ Positive\n\nFuture reporting: The event is resolved.

Predators and scavengers, including dogs and cats, that bite into a sick or dead hare can become infected. People who handle infected hares can also contract the disease.\n\nThe disease also can be spread by ticks found on hares and water contaminated with a dead animal.\n\n'Hares die of this infection every spring and summer in the Interior,' Beckmen said.\n\nA local resident brought a sick hare with many ticks to a Fairbanks veterinary clinic last week. Tests conducted by a diagnostic lab in Colorado confirmed the presence of the bacterium that causes tularemia. Tularemia can be fatal in humans if an infected person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics. However, human cases in Alaska are rare and only one case about every 2 years is reported. The most common symptoms in humans include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, fever, flu-like illness, diarrhea, or pneumonia.\n\nMore commonly, dogs or cats are infected with the disease after they've encountered a sick or infected hare. Pets that become infected may show fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and swollen lymph glands. Infected animals can be treated with antibiotics but it's important to do so quickly, Beckmen said, because tularemia can be contracted through the bite of an infected pet.\n\nBeckmen encouraged anyone who sees a sick hare to contact ADFG at 459-7206 to report it. Signs that a hare is infected include lack of fear of people, lethargy, and sudden death.\n\nPeople who need to touch a dead hare can protect themselves by using gloves or a plastic bag and washing their hands afterward. Dead hares should be double bagged and disposed in the trash or where pets and scavengers cannot get to them.\n\nPeople are also advised not to drink untreated water from areas where there are beavers and muskrats.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_ , is a non sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 percent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as, cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/52400.htm.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Alaska may be found at http://healthmap.org/r/7t0w. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk.

So far, 2 people in the area were affected by tularemia. The latest is your typical 9 year old kid who loves the outdoors and this summer has been no exception.\n\n'The 1st week of June 2013, he did a fishing camp at the school so he was around the lakes and river near North Platte. So every day I said 'Let's check for ticks.' I grew up camping and knew that was kind of the standard thing,' said the mother who then removed 3 ticks from her son but one of the bite sites seemed to heal.\n\n'A couple days later it started hurting on my neck,' said the boy. 'He was getting tireder and tireder and more and more neck pain. It got to the point where he was so stiff he wasn't even moving his neck like it was broken or something,' said the father.\n\nThey went to the hospital where the boy was diagnosed with an uncommon infection called tularemia that can be transmitted through animals by ticks. 'It's mostly rodents and rabbits are probably the main reservoir but other rodents can carry the bacteria,' says Eduardo Freitas, MD, an infectious diseases physician.\n\nTick and deer fly bites are one of the most common ways the disease is transmitted [but it can also be transmitted] through skin contact with infected animals, ingestion of infected water, and inhaling infected dust contaminants. And while it is contagious between animals and humans, 'it is not spread from human to human,' Freitas says.\n\nEven though there are 2 confirmed cases in the area and several statewide, physicians aren't worried yet. 'They are still within the expected numbers; unless this changes over the next few weeks and then we'll be more alarmed,' Freitas says.

The rabbit was collected in the 1000 Block of West Saginaw Drive after it had contact with a child.\n\n'Tularemia is similar to plague. It is typically found in animals, especially rabbits,' said Scott Cowan, program manager of the Disease Prevention and Emergency Preparedness Division at the Pueblo City-County Health Department. 'Tularemia can be passed to humans or animals through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies, and by handling infected, sick, or dead animals,' said Cowan. The disease can also be passed to people or animals if they eat meat or drink water infected by the bacteria.\n\n'It is very important not to pet or come in contact with wild animals,' stated Cowan. He explained, 'A child petted this rabbit before the rabbit died, potentially exposing the child to the bacteria. The child currently has no symptoms of tularemia and is on a fever watch.'\n\nTularemia is a potentially serious illness that occurs naturally in the United States. It is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ found in animals (especially rodents, rabbits, and prairie dogs).\n\nPeople can get tularemia multiple ways:\n- being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect\n- handling infected animal carcasses\n- eating or drinking contaminated food or water\n- breathing in the bacteria, _F. tularensis_\n\nTularemia is not spread from person to person. People who have tularemia do not need to be isolated. People who have been exposed to the tularemia bacteria should be treated as soon as possible. The disease can be fatal if it is not treated with the right antibiotics.\n\nSymptoms of tularemia usually occur 3-5 days after exposure and may include:\n- sudden fever\n- chills\n- headaches\n- diarrhea\n- muscle aches\n- joint pain\n- dry cough\n- progressive weakness\n\nPeople can also develop pneumonia and may have the following symptoms: chest pain, bloody sputum, trouble breathing and they even sometimes stop breathing.\n\nOther symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria. These symptoms can include ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.\n\nThe Pueblo City-County Health Department recommends the following to protect against the disease:\n- Avoid all contact with wild rabbits, squirrels and rodents; do not feed or handle them.\n- Avoid ticks. The best protection for pets, especially cats, is to keep them indoors. If outdoors with your pets, protect them with a flea collar; keeping them out of heavily wooded areas can provide additional protection, as these areas are ideal for ticks to live.\n- Stay out of areas wild rodents inhabit. If you enter areas with wild rodents, wear insect repellent containing DEET or treat clothing with repellent containing permethrin.\n- Prevent your pets from hunting or eating wild rodents, especially rabbits.\n- Never touch sick or dead animals with your bare hands. If an animal must be moved, use a long-handled shovel to place it in a garbage bag, and place the bag in an outdoor garbage can.\n- Avoid drinking unpurified water from streams or lakes and prevent your pets from doing the same.\n- See a physician if you become ill with a high fever and/or a swollen lymph node. Tularemia is a treatable illness when diagnosed early.\n- See a veterinarian if you pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.\n\n'It is important for pet owners keep their animals from roaming outside, as they can be exposed to tularemia when hunting rabbits and/or prairie dogs,' stated Cowan. 'Do not let your pets roam; do not let them eat dead animals; protect your pets with a flea and tick collar, and keep an eye on their health and take then to the veterinarian if clinical signs develop.'\n\nNote any change in the behavior of your pets especially cats, as well as notice activity of rodents, rabbits, and prairie dogs or livestock, and consult a veterinarian if your pet develops unusual signs.\n\nThis is the 1st identified case of tularemia in animals in Pueblo County this year [2013]. No human cases of tularemia have been reported this year.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially [Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. - CopyEd.MSP], which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review.

Since the middle of April 2013, there have been 4 cases in people and 6 cases in dogs and cats. The human cases include a 45-year-old man from Santa Fe County, an 88-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 62-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, and a 75-year-old woman from San Juan County. 3 of the human cases were hospitalized and all have recovered and gone home. Onset of illness in the most recent case was 15 Jun 2013. The pet cases include 2 cats and a dog from Santa Fe County, a dog from Sandoval County, a dog from Los Alamos County, and a cat from Torrance County. They have all recovered.\n\n'I would encourage people in the mentioned counties and around the state to follow the same precautions they would to avoid plague,' said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. 'Don't handle sick or dead rodents, don't allow pets to roam and hunt, get an appropriate tick and flea control product for pets, and take sick pets to a veterinarian. Since tularemia can be fatal in a small percentage of cases, it should be treated with antibiotics following an evaluation by a physician.'\n\nTularemia is a potentially serious illness in people that occurs naturally in the USA. It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits, and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick. Symptoms of tularemia in people usually develop 3 to 5 days after exposure but onset can vary from 1 to 14 days. Tularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscles aches, and joint pain. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.\n\n'The recent human cases in New Mexico had various exposures to tularemia, including skinning a rabbit with bare hands, receiving a bite from a sick cat, cleaning out a water trough with a dead rabbit in it, and being bitten by a deer fly or a tick on the lower leg,' said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. 'Oftentimes there is a rabbit or rodent die-off in an area due to tularemia and deer flies or ticks can become infected from these animals and then pass it on to pets or people when they bite them.'\n\nPeople can get tularemia in different ways: handling infected animal carcasses; being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect; eating or drinking contaminated food or water or by breathing in the bacteria.

The counties mentioned can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/new-mexico.shtml.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that is occasionally seen in dogs. It is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. It is associated with multiple animal species, including humans, and can be acquired from through contact with infected animals, infected wounds or soil. It is also commonly know as rabbit fever for its mode of transmission, even while it can infect several types of animals and be transmitted via any infected animal, as such, the bacteria can also be acquired by ingestion of contaminated water, or through contact with infected soil, where the organism can remain in an infectious state for up to several months.\n\nInfection is often caused by ingestion of an infected mammals' tissue, such as when a dog/cat hunts a small animal, bird or reptile, through water, or by tick, mite, flea or mosquito bite -- all of which can carry and transmit the bacteria. The bacterium may also infect a cat or dog through its skin, or by entering its airways, eyes, or gastrointestinal system.\n\nClinical signs seen in domestic pets include: sudden onset of fever, lethargy, dehydration, lack of appetite (anorexia), enlargement of the lymph nodes, tender abdomen, enlargement of spleen or liver, white patches or ulcers on the tongue, and jaundice which may be indicated by yellow eyes.\n\nRabbits and other wild rodents are the primary species affected. Tularemia can also affect beaver and muskrats. Livestock and pets including pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish and birds can also get tularemia. Sheep are especially susceptible. Cattle rarely get the disease.\n\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/tularemia_F.pdf. - Mod. TG]\n\n[_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat.

It also has raised questions about the impact of drought, overpopulation and habitat destruction on wildlife. Officials say there are no reports of human illness.\n\nWhat is known for sure is that 7 of the beavers that thrived in and along McCullough Creek in the park died in the last year [2012]. The cause is less certain.\n\n'There is no conclusive evidence,' researcher Nohra Mateus-Pinilla said, 'but it appears that the only thing that could have caused the die-off is an outbreak of tularemia.' She emphasized that tularemia bacteria are common. 'They are present in rabbits and squirrels,' she said. 'They are part of the natural ecosystem.'\n\nMateus-Pinilla, a wildlife veterinary epidemiologist at the Illinois Natural History Survey, said it is possible that severe drought exacerbated the outbreak, with low water levels forcing beavers and other animals to live in closer quarters. Continuing destruction of wildlife habitat has a similar effect, she said.\n\nDerek Liebert, project manager at the Urbana Park District, said a wildlife biologist suggested to him that if tularemia is in fact the cause, the die-off may be a corrective measure for a population that grew too large.\n\nThe Champaign-Urbana Public Health District issued an alert notifying residents of tularemia in the area. The alert cited a Meadowbrook beaver diagnosed with clinical symptoms of tularemia and an unrelated 2011 outbreak among 5 pet cats in Champaign, Urbana and Savoy.\n\nHealth district planning director Awais Vaid said people should not let their pets roam and should take them to a veterinarian if they exhibit symptoms such as loss of appetite or difficulty with movement. People who see sick animals in the wild or along trails should not approach them, Vaid said, not only because of the risk of tularemia but of rabies.\n\nThe park district warns Meadowbrook users to keep pets leashed and to stay on trails in the park. Mateus-Pinilla reinforced local government warnings about allowing domestic animals to roam or run unleashed.\n\n'Then you are bringing them into your house, where there is direct contact. That is more serious,' she said.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, tularemia is common among wild rodents and can be transmitted to other animals and humans through direct contact and by ticks, biting flies and other insects. In humans, tularemia bacteria can cause illness ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening.\n\nLiebert said the 1st dead beaver was found in January 2012. It was taken to the University of Illinois veterinary diagnostic laboratory, where tests were conducted, with inconclusive results. Then in June and September, 2 adult beavers were found dead but were too decomposed to be necropsied, he said.\n\nThe biggest spate of deaths occurred in October [2012], when 3 beavers were found, 2 of which were necropsied. In November, a 7th beaver was found. Liebert said the most recent sighting of a live beaver, a single individual, occurred 19 Dec 2012.\n\nThe effort to isolate the cause of the deaths was hampered by several circumstances, Mateus-Pinilla said. One is that decomposition sets in rapidly, and sometimes there is not much a pathologist can do because of the condition of the body. The 'gold standard' for a confirmed diagnosis, Mateus-Pinilla said, is the ability to grow a culture of the suspect bacteria. The Meadowbrook beavers were tested for several pathogens, including tularemia, salmonella, leptospira and canine distemper. No tests resulted positive.\n\nHowever, investigators were able to rule out toxins, such as from run-off, and also found evidence pointing to tularemia, even if it did not amount to a confirmed diagnosis.\n\nMateus-Pinilla said salmonella and leptospira were eliminated, for example, because salmonella would not have caused a die-off, and leptospira is associated with lesions not found in the necropsies. But investigators did find certain changes in the lungs typical of tularemia. In the end, Mateus-Pinilla said, what signs there were pointed to tularemia.\n\nMateus-Pinilla said it is unlikely that the habitat provided by the park itself was to blame. Indeed, she said, the fact that beavers were thriving there 'tells us it was a suitable habitat.' Unfortunately, she said, the die-off 'also tells us that natural habitats are more and more disturbed, forcing the beavers to be in a more dense population.'\n\nHuman attraction to nature puts people in closer contact with wildlife diseases, she added. 'We want to put our house in the woods,' and as a result 'we are getting closer to diseases that we wouldn't find in the middle of New York City.'\n\nMateus-Pinilla sees an opportunity for independent research through close monitoring of future colonies at Meadowbrook.\n\n'I would love to see it happening,' she said. The Meadowbrook beavers are 'close to one of the biggest wildlife research institutions in the United States. We have the resources, and we have the students.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia is caused by the gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.

Dr Tom Safranek, Nebraska's state epidemiologist, said 6 cases of the disease have been confirmed in the state this year [2013]. A 4 year old in North Platte is one of them.\n\nThe girl spent Memorial Day weekend [25-27 May 2013] swimming in Birdwood Creek and the Interstate lakes near Hershey. Afterward, her mother noticed a tick on the left side of her daughter's neck. She pulled the bug off and forgot about it. Soon after, the young girl developed a rash and fever and complained of neck pain. The lymph nodes behind her ear and by her clavicle swelled.\n\nThe mother, a registered nurse, became concerned that her daughter might have meningitis. She took her to Great Plains Pediatrics in North Platte, where another tick was found in the girl's hairline near her left ear. 'The tick wasn't imbedded completely, but it was evident it had been there for a while,' the mother said. 'The site was infected. There was a red, swollen area about 3 inches [7.5 cm] wide that was hot to the touch.' Cultures were done, and the girl was put on an antibiotic and sent home. When she started complaining about a sore throat a few days later, her mother took her back to the pediatrician's office.\n\n'By then, she had pustules on the roof of her mouth and her throat was swollen,' the mother said. 'The areas where both ticks had bitten her were even more inflamed, and the skin around them was peeling.' More cultures were performed and the girl was put on another antibiotic, which caused an allergic reaction. Ultimately, the girl was taken to the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha.\n\nOn 6 Jun 2013, the girl was diagnosed with tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever. Because of the mother's nursing background, officials at the children's hospital agreed to let her treat her daughter at home with IV Gentamicin 3 times a day for 9 days, with resolution occurring.\n\nAccording to Safranek, tularemia can be life threatening. Caused by bacteria, it can attack the skin, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, and other internal organs. Safranek said the disease is most common in mammals, especially rodents and rabbits.\n\nSafranek said that the biggest problem with both tularemia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, another tickborne disease, is that they are so uncommon they are often overlooked. 'Doctors often misdiagnose them and prescribe the wrong antibiotics to treat them,' Safranek said. 'The good news is they are preventable.' He said people should use care when handling dead animals, wear insect repellent and do frequent tick checks because the transmission rate is low if ticks are removed quickly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.\n\nTularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus.

In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness.\n\nIn this case, it was not stated what body fluids were culture positive for the organism but oropharyngeal involvement seemed prominent. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/7oVU.]", "summary": "\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols.

The etiologic agent, _Francisella tularensis_, is highly infectious and can be transmitted through arthropod bites, direct contact with infected animal tissue, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, and ingestion of contaminated food or water (1). _F. tularensis_ has been designated a Tier 1 select agent because it meets several criteria, including low infectious dose, ability to infect via aerosol, and a history of being developed as a bioweapon (2). This report summarizes tularemia cases reported to CDC during 2001-2010 via the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and compares the epidemiology of these cases with those reported during the preceding decade. During 2001-2010, a total of 1208 cases were reported (median: 126.5 cases per year; range: 90-154). Incidence was highest among children aged 5-9 years and men aged greater than 55 years. Clinicians and public health practitioners should be familiar with the current epidemiology and clinical features of tularemia to identify and adequately treat individual cases and recognize unusual patterns that might signal an outbreak or bioterrorism event.\n\nIn humans, _F. tularensis_ causes distinct clinical syndromes depending on the route of exposure. Percutaneous inoculation typically produces ulceroglandular tularemia, characterized by a cutaneous ulcer at the site of inoculation and tender regional lymphadenopathy. A less common presentation after percutaneous inoculation is glandular tularemia, in which patients develop regional lymphadenopathy without ulcer. Inhalation of _F. tularensis_ can result in a primary pneumonia, whereas ingestion causes oropharyngeal disease consisting of tonsillitis or pharyngitis with cervical lymphadenopathy. Other forms of tularemia include oculoglandular (infection of the eye) and typhoidal (fever without localizing signs) (3). Certain strains of _F. tularensis_ subspecies _tularensis_ (also known as type A) are associated with more severe disease and a greater risk for death (4,5). Mortality is less than 2 percent overall but ranges up to 24 percent depending on the strain (1,4).\n\nFor national surveillance purposes, a confirmed case of tularemia is defined as clinically compatible illness with either a 4-fold or greater change in serum antibody titer to _F. tularensis_ antigen or isolation of _F. tularensis_ from a clinical specimen. A probable case is defined as clinically compatible illness with either a single elevated antibody titer to _F. tularensis_ antigen or detection of _F. tularensis_ in a clinical specimen by fluorescent assay (6). In this report, incidence is calculated using 2005 census population estimates.\n\nA total of 1208 cases of tularemia were reported via NNDSS during 2001-2010. The median number of cases per year was 126.5, with a range of 90-154 cases per year. Of these 1208 reported cases, 64 percent were categorized as confirmed and 35 percent as probable (Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Median age of patients was 39 years (range: 1-92 years), and 68 percent were male. Average annual incidence was 0.041 cases per 100 000 persons. By age group and sex, annual incidence was highest among children aged 5-9 years (0.071) and among men aged 65-69 years (0.11) (Figure 2). Race was recorded for 887 patients (73 percent). Among these, 86 percent were white, 9 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 3 percent were black. Ethnicity was recorded for 718 patients (59 percent), of whom 5 percent were Hispanic. The highest annual incidence by race was among American Indians/Alaska Natives (0.3 per 100 000 persons).\n\nCases were reported from 47 states (Figure 3). Of those, 6 states accounted for 59 percent of reported cases: Missouri (19 percent), Arkansas (13 percent), Oklahoma (9 percent), Massachusetts (7 percent), South Dakota (5 percent), and Kansas (5 percent). Among the 10 states with the highest incidence of tularemia, all but Massachusetts were located in the central or western United States (Table).\n\nTularemia cases were reported from 505 American counties (16 percent) during 2001-2010. County of residence was available for 1198 patients (99 percent), although in some cases this might not have been the county of exposure. Among these, 53 percent of patients resided in counties classified as rural by CDC National Center for Health Statistics' Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties (7), although rural counties accounted for only 17 percent of the US population in 2006. The county with the highest annual incidence was Dukes County (Martha's Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands), Massachusetts (67 cases; 43 per 100 000 persons). Cases in Dukes County were reported consistently during the 10-year period (range: 2-16 cases per year), with substantial increases in 2005 (11 cases), 2006 (10 cases), and 2008 (16 cases). Additional counties with high incidence rates were Buffalo County, South Dakota (6 cases; 29 per 100 000), and Shannon County, South Dakota (24 cases; 18 per 100 000).\n\nThe majority of cases (77 percent) occurred during May through September, consistent with peak arthropod activity and increased outdoor human activity. However, seasonal patterns varied by region. In the New England states, no cases occurred in the nonpeak winter months of December through March. In contrast, 20 percent of cases in the South Atlantic states, 15 percent in the East South Central states, and 14 percent in the Pacific states occurred from December through March.\n\nThe total number of cases reported during 2001-2010 was similar to the number reported during the 10-year period 1991-2000 (1208 versus 1216, respectively). Nevertheless, notable changes occurred in the number of cases reported from some individual states: Montana (72 percent decrease), Arkansas (42 percent decrease), South Dakota (29 percent decrease), Massachusetts (155 percent increase), Nebraska (120 percent increase), and Oklahoma (35 percent increase) (8).\n\nEditorial Note:\nDuring 2001-2010, the number and demographic features of reported tularemia cases were similar to those reported during the preceding decade. Nevertheless, several differences were noted between the 2 periods. The geographic distribution of reported cases was slightly less concentrated in the central states during 2001-2010, with a greater proportion of cases reported from the Northeast and the Pacific states of Washington and California than in previous years. In addition, 4 states that had not reported cases during 1991-2000 (Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, and West Virginia) reported cases during 2001-2010. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the change in distribution was caused by alterations in reporting patterns, vector distribution, human behavior, or other factors.\n\nSeasonal variations by region are likely attributable in part to climate differences, because states with milder climates have longer arthropod activity and thus extended periods of risk. Seasonal variations might also reflect, to some extent, hunting activities that can occur year-round, in contrast to landscaping and other outdoor recreational activities that are concentrated in the summer months. Hunting can result in human exposure to tularemia through direct contact with infected animals and ingestion of infected meat. Hunting of rabbits, which typically occurs in the fall and winter, might explain the higher proportion of winter cases in South Atlantic and East South Central states, where small game hunting is common (9).\n\nIn a previous surveillance report for the period 1990-2000, CDC recommended improving surveillance by increasing documentation of laboratory confirmation and collecting more detailed epidemiologic and clinical data (8). Documentation of laboratory confirmation has indeed improved; during 1990-2000, only 65 percent of case reports included documentation indicating whether they met the probable versus confirmed case definition, compared with 99 percent during 2001-2010. Although the amount of epidemiologic and clinical data collected through NNDSS has not changed, CDC does regularly request additional patient information from health departments to better characterize the disease.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations: 1st, the tularemia cases described in this report might not be fully representative of all cases diagnosed in the United States because case ascertainment and reporting might be incomplete and differ by state; 2nd, missing data and small numbers limit statistical comparisons and interpretation.\n\nTularemia is not a common disease, but it continues to cause approximately 100 reported human cases annually in the United States and is a serious and potentially fatal disease. Although outbreaks do occur (10), the majority of reported tularemia cases in the United States are sporadic. Clinicians should consider tularemia in patients with a compatible clinical profile, particularly in children and elderly males with acute fever and regional lymphadenopathy. This report shows that the distribution of tularemia might be gradually changing; therefore, tularemia should be considered even in areas where it has rarely been reported.\n\nState and local public health departments are encouraged to report tularemia cases in a timely manner and provide additional patient information, including exposure history, clinical syndrome, and outcome, to CDC when possible. Because the threat of bioterrorism remains, clinicians and health departments should remain vigilant; for example, an urban cluster of tularemia cases among persons without a common natural exposure could be the 1st sign of a bioterrorism attack.\n\nReferences\n------------\n1.

A substantial number of the cases are pneumonic, occurring in landscapers and gardeners, related to the aerosolization of infective bacteria.\n\nTelford and colleagues (1) have investigated the genetic diversity of _F. tularensis_ obtained from Martha's Vineyard ticks. Between 2001 and 2003, 0.7 per cent of 4246 dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) harbored the tularemia bacillus, and there was a degree of genotypic diversity suggestive of long-standing enzootic transmission of the infection on the island. The authors review information regarding the island's tularemia, which appears to have been a relatively recent introduction into Massachusetts. They state that prior to 1937, only one case of the infection was recognized, related to contaminated rabbit meat from the Midwest USA. In 1937, however, more than 20 000 cottontail rabbits from the Midwest states of Missouri and Kansas were introduced into the Massachusetts mainland and Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket for sporting purposes (2). Cases began to occur starting several years later.\n\nAnother interesting observation relates to tularemia's role in the search for evidence of bioterrorism using air sensor detectors of the BioWatch program. At least 3 episodes of air screening positivity for tularemia occurred during this decade in Saint Louis, Missouri; Washington, DC; and Houston, Texas; no human cases occurred during those episodes and all 3 likely not related to any deliberate event.

It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) and rodents, especially microtine rodents such as voles, vole rats, and muskrats, as well as in beavers. In addition, a wide variety of other mammals, birds, amphibians, and invertebrates have been reported to be infected.\n\nTularemia occurs endemically in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease can occur as epizootic outbreaks in many countries in North America and Europe, while it occurs only as sporadic cases in some other countries in Europe and Asia. It is rarely reported from the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. Several epizootic outbreaks have been reported as a result of importation of subclinically infected lagomorphs.\n\nThe clinically most relevant 2 types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of culture characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence. _Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is mainly associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is primarily transmitted by ticks or biting flies, or by direct contact with infected lagomorphs. It is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) and voles in northern North America, and in lagomorphs (hares) and rodents in Eurasia. It is primarily transmitted by direct contact or by mosquitoes, but may be transmitted through inhalation or through infected water or food. It is less virulent for humans and domestic rabbits and does not ferment glycerol.

Specialists from Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Health are in the area.\n\nTularemia is a dangerous infection characterized by intoxication, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Tularemia is most common in rural areas. Human infections are rare in the city and are associated with infected products or animals. Often, the sources of infection are common field and house mice, water rats, rabbits, muskrats, hamsters, and other rodents.\n\nTularemia infection can occur through contact with sick rodents or their droppings, by consumption of contaminated food or water, from infected secretions from rodents, via airborne dust when processing contaminated cereals and fodder, and by mosquitoes.\n\nOne of the characteristics of tularemia is an almost 100 percent susceptibility to the disease regardless of age. There is no person-to-person transmission, and persons who have had the disease acquire immunity to it.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview Pedigree English Longhorns\nGut Laach\n52385 Nideggen\nGermany\n<cvlonghorns@aol.com>\n\n[The manifestations of tularemia in the reported cases are not specified.

'Specialists went to visit all places where a sick person stayed.'\n\nAllegedly, the sick person previously resided in the village of Kezhma, which was partially flooded by water filling the Boguchany Dam. The other day he came to town on personal business. There, his dog caught a muskrat and brought it to him. He butchered the muskrat and fed the dog. Some time later, the man had fever and boils.\n\nThe sick man told the Krasnoyarsk bloggers, he suspects that this all happened because of poor cleaning of the reservoir bed.

On his way back home to Aban, the man found himself sick with typical anthrax symptoms, and 5 days later he was hospitalized in the infectious ward of the Kan hospital. Moreover, according to published information, analysis sent to Krasnoyarsk, confirmed the diagnosis of anthrax.\n\nThe Ministry of Health of the Krasnoyarsk Region confirmed the admission and isolation of all the patient's contacts; however, it was too early to draw conclusions about the diagnosis -- the final results of the examination will be available only in 3 weeks -- and the preliminary analysis of anthrax was not confirmed. The man's disease looks like a lung infection -- tularemia, which is treated with antibiotics. The patient is currently doing well.\n\nIn this case, epidemiologists emphasize that the probability of contracting anthrax from muskrats is extremely low, as rodents are extremely resistant to this disease. In addition, the Ministry of Health added that, even if the diagnosis of anthrax is confirmed, it is in the lightest skin form, which is also treated with antibiotics.\n\nNonetheless, all medical services of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, particularly in Kezhemsky, Boguchany, Abanskom areas, have been given special instructions and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of such patients.\n\nIn addition, experts have yet to identify the epidemic source of the infection, so they have to go through the entire routes of the sick person and collect samples.\n\nResponding to the suggestion that the source of infection could be an unprocessed animal burial site at the bottom of the Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) reservoir, the representative of the Rospotrebnadzor in Krasnoyarsk region assured that the Irkutsk Anti-Plague Institute sanitized all known animal burial sites in accordance with the current regulations.

The mechanism of action of ustekinumab would suggest it may impair specific host intracellular defences against _Francisella tularensis_, and thus tularaemia should be a clinical consideration if patients exposed to IL12/23 inhibitors present with compatible illness, even with only a geographic exposure history.\n\nCase: A 61-year-old man from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was blood culture positive for _F. tularensis_, after admission to hospital for pneumonia, sepsis, and gastroenteritis on 17 Jun 2012. He experienced a subacute onset of weakness, shortness of breath, and cough, with development of vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss for 6 weeks prior to admission. There were no rashes, lymphadenopathy, or obvious fever. While at his lake property in Northern Alberta he had an acute deterioration and at hospital admission was febrile at 39.2 deg C [102.6 deg F], and both chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest revealed a right middle lobe lateral segment opacity, small right pleural effusion, and reactive lymph nodes.\n\nHis laboratory work showed a progressive lymphocytosis over his stay and he had a mild acute kidney injury at initial assessment, which normalized over his hospital stay. A blood culture obtained on 16 Jun 2012 became positive after 4 days of incubation, with gram negative coccobacilli subsequently confirmed to be _F. tularensis_ susceptible to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and gentamicin. His therapy was changed to high dose ciprofloxacin to complete 3 weeks total of antimicrobial therapy. He has been followed clinically with no evidence of relapse to date.\n\nThe patient has a relevant medical history of chronic alcohol use and formerly severe psoriasis, on Stelara (ustekinumab) for the past 2.5 years, with prior use of an anti-TNF [anti-tumor necrosis factor] agent. Epidemiologically, the patient spends 3 days per week at his lake property, which was his only evident risk history in terms of acquiring _F. tularensis_ infection. He hadn't gone hunting for 20 years, doesn't fish or trap, and he had no exposure to rodents or lagomorphs in the wild. There are wild hares around this property but he does not recall any exposures to live or dead hares when mowing his yard.\n\nTularaemia is reported to occur in wild animals in all jurisdictions in Canada except the Yukon and Nunavut, most frequently in beaver, muskrat, and snowshoe hares. Worldwide, this zoonosis occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, with foci throughout North America, Europe, and northern Asia.\n\nReviewing the pathophysiology of tularaemia in view of this patient immunomodulating therapy, there are data suggesting that TNF-alfa, Il-10, Il-12, and gamma interferon are important in evoking an early T-cell independent host defence, as well as driving an expansion of a protective TH1 cell response. This intracellular organism is known to be phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages, and then it escapes the phagosome and replicates in the cytosol. Host cell response in the in vitro setting suggests significant upregulation of IL-23 as well as IL-12 production early in infection, suggesting that IL-23 and IL-12 play important roles in these host defence events.\n\nTherefore, it would appear to be very likely that ustekinumab is a significant risk factor for infection after what would appear to be a trivial exposure to _F. tularensis_. The patient indicated a strong preference to remain on his therapy, given significant quality-of-life issues related to his psoriasis in the past. In consultation with his dermatologist, his medication was stopped and alternate psoriasis therapy offered.\n\nClinicians should be aware of this potential association when evaluating infections in patients on IL 12/23 inhibitors, as beta-lactam based therapies commonly used for empiric therapy of sepsis would not be effective, and culture results can be delayed. The only currently licensed medication with this mechanism is ustekinumab, which is indicated in psoriasis, and is under evaluation for Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis.\n\n(This case is also being submitted for publication, and was reported to the manufacturer of the drug.)\n\n--\nDr Lynora Saxinger\nAssociate Professor, Division of Infectious Diseases\nDepartments of Medicine and Medical Microbiology and Immunology\nUniversity of Alberta Hospital\nEdmonton\nCanada\n<lynora.saxinger@ualberta.ca>\n\n[Many cases of tularemia involve lymph node infection with (ulceroglandular) or without (glandular) a local skin infection draining to the lymph node.

The disease, also known as 'rabbit fever,' was confirmed by the state laboratory after testing a dead rabbit this past week.\n\n'We usually see one or 2 cases of tularemia in animals each year,' said Stephen Everett, epidemiologist for YCCHS. People and pets who spend time outdoors can contact tularemia if they are bitten by deerflies, ticks or other insects or by handling infected rodents or rabbits, he said.\n\nTularemia is a treatable, naturally occurring illness in the United States, with about 120 [human] cases reported each year. Most occur within the western and south-central states. A germ that animals (especially rodents, rabbits and hares) carry causes the disease, which can be passed on to domestic animals and people. Family pets with outdoor roaming privileges can carry ticks into the home and may expose humans to tick-borne illnesses. Rarely, tularemia can spread to humans through contaminated food or water or by inhaling the airborne germ. It is not known to spread from person to person.\n\nPeople can avoid tularemia by applying DEET-based insect repellent to exposed skin while spending time outdoors. People can also apply tick medicine and tick collars to cats and dogs to protect the pet and the owner. Pet owners should also avoid touching any dead animal that their cat may have brought home. Hunters should wear rubber gloves when skinning game to protect themselves from contaminated blood getting in an open wound.\n\nSymptoms in humans include sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, progressive weakness and, in severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia. Symptoms vary from person to person and generally show up 3 to 5 days after exposure, but sometimes as late as 14 days later.\n\nThose who think they may have contracted tularemia should contact their doctors at the 1st sign of illness and tell them if you have had exposure to sick or dead animals, if you are pregnant or if you have a weakened immune system. Also, note any changes in pet behavior and consult a veterinarian if the pet develops unusual symptoms.\n\nFor more information or concerns about tularemia, contact YCCHS Environmental Health Unit in Prescott.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[To quote my colleague Larry Lutwick: '_Francisella tularensis_, the bacterium that causes tularemia, is considered a category-A bioterrorism agent. Cases associated with the skinning of rabbits usually involve glandular (lymph node) or ulceroglandular (skin and lymph node) infection. Large outbreaks, especially in eastern Europe or Asia, can be associated with water exposure.\n\nPneumonic tularemia can cause a severe and fatal pneumonia when the organism is spread by aerosol, as might occur in a biological attack. However, pneumonic tularemia also occurs without the involvement of bioterrorism, as demonstrated by posts below in New York City as well as outbreaks on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Unlike pneumonic plague, pneumonic tularemia does not spread from person to person.'\n\nIt's that time of year again. While the Arizona report has this disease correctly concentrated in the western and south central states it occurs across the northern tier and along the Atlantic coast states though in smaller numbers. To get an idea of this latter distribution just do a posting recall on 'tularemia AND usa'. But even in the high incidence areas all we usually see is just the occasional and sporadic dead rabbit. Then suddenly there will be a summer when one suddenly has 10 or more square miles of dead jack rabbits. What triggers it from being a background to a foreground situation is obscure. Over the years the Texas veterinary public health surveillance teams have been running tick safaris. Their collection of _F. tularensis_ strains will vary from the lethal to the essentially apathogenic. The epidemiology and ecology of this disease awaits clarification. - Mod.MHJ\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1FWX.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThose who think they may have contracted tularemia should contact their doctors at the 1st sign of illness and tell them if you have had exposure to sick or dead animals, if you are pregnant or if you have a weakened immune system. \n\nSymptoms in humans include sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, progressive weakness and, in severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia. \n\nPneumonic tularemia can cause a severe and fatal pneumonia when the organism is spread by aerosol, as might occur in a biological attack.

The extent of the risk-area for this\ninfection within Tasmania is unclear, but based on these recent cases,\nmay be relatively restricted.

Symptoms of the disease in people include\nsudden fever, chills, diarrhea, joint pain, muscle aches, cough, and\nweakness. If you have those symptoms, see your doctor for treatment.\n\nTips to avoid tularemia from the health district:\n- Don't allow your cat to hunt outdoors.\n- Make sure your cat is protected from tick bites.\n- Report any large die-offs of rodents or rabbits to local animal\ncontrol officials.\n- Wear tick protection outdoors.\n- Don't handle or mow over sick or dead animals.\n- Cook wild game meat thoroughly before eating it and use gloves when\nhandling it beforehand.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Illinois can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail\ninteractive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1f33. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_ , is a non\nsporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related\nto _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is\nkilled rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks\nor months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can\nbe cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their\nbiochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in\nNorth America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may\nbe 5-7 percent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most\ncommonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections\nin North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from\narthropod vectors.\n\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical\ninfection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at\nincreased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an\nincreased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little\nis known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in\ndomestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and\njackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North\nAmerica, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and\nAsia.\n\nTularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by\naerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of\naerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in\nan act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact\nwith, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as,\ncottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular,\noropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal\nform. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in\ninfection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection\ntransstadially and transovarially, which makes them an efficient\nreservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include\n_Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the\nlone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the dog tick), and\n_Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly).\n\nThe most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the\nbite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat\nimproperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats,\nand other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an\ninfected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source\nof infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to\npeople.\n\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals, the\ndisease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy,\nanorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with\nsepticemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased.\nCoughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and death\nmay occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized\nby signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15\npercent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\n\nPeople may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending\non how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin\nulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen\nand painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria\nare inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever,\nchills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive\nweakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing,\nwhich may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum,\nand respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not\ntreated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases\n(especially plague) or acute pneumonia.\n\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are\neffective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and\nchloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early\ntreatment should prevent death loss. Control is difficult and is\nlimited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and\ntreatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms\nare intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at\nhigh risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently\nunder review.

Possible symptoms include skin\nulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen\nand painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. \n\n[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_ , is a non\nsporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related\nto _Brucella_ spp. Cats are at\nincreased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an\nincreased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at\nhigh risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently\nunder review. Dogs, cats,\nand other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an\ninfected carcass. Little\nis known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in\ndomestic animals. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing,\nwhich may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum,\nand respiratory failure. Type B is less virulent and is most\ncommonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections\nin North America and Eurasia. Type A has been found predominantly in\nNorth America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may\nbe 5-7 percent if untreated.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague", "tularemia"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-09-25 00:00:00", "2021-07-25 00:00:00", "2011-09-14 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "905396", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Tularemia - USA: (DE)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=905396", "date": "2011-10-11 13:38:23", "main_text": "TULAREMIA - USA: (DELAWARE)\n***************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 7 Oct 2011\nSource: Delaware Health and Social Services (DHSS) [edited]\nhttp://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/pressreleases/2011/tulameria-100711.html\n\n\nOn Thu 6 Oct 2011, the Delaware Public Health [DPH] Laboratory\nconfirmed Delaware's 1st case of tularemia since 2003, in a 45\nyear-old Kent County man.

This gram-negative bacterium contains\nseveral highly pathogenic subspecies, whose distribution is ubiquitous\nin the northern hemisphere. Because of its pathogenic potential,\ntularaemia is a notifiable bacterial zoonosis in France, and is listed\nas potential bioterrorist weapon. The bacterium has very complex\nepidemiological cycles, including many wild species, whose\nepidemiological role is sometimes unclear. Namely, _F. tularensis_ has\nbeen isolated from more than 250 species, including 190 mammals, 88\ninvertebrates, 23 birds, 3 amphibians, as well as several species of\nreptiles and fishes, and 2 disease cycles, terrestrial and aquatic\nhave been described. The interaction between these 2 cycles remains\nnot well known. In general, the disease cycle involves only few key\nspecies in a given region. In the terrestrial cycle in France, the\nEuropean brown hare plays an important role in the ecology of\ntularaemia as amplifying host, and it may serve as a significant\nsource of human infection. Hare tularaemia has been reported in most\nof the departments in France, but endemic areas have been described in\nthe northern part of France. A recent increase in cases in hares has\nbeen observed in 2007 and 2008. At the same time, during the winter,\nan excess of human cases has been reported (144 sporadic cases from 1\nJan 2007 to 31 Dec 2008, including 48 cases in 2007 and 96 in 2008,\nagainst a mean of 23 cases per year for the period 2003 to 2006), but\nthe factors responsible for this increase have not been identified.\n\nAlthough tularaemia is often fatal to hares, hare tularaemia in\nFrance is usually sporadic and does not significantly affect hare\npopulations. We report here an outbreak of tularaemia in brown hares\nin France, which occurred in Pas-de-Calais from January to March 2011\nand was characterised by a high mortality rate in the local hare\npopulation. The epizootic form of the outbreak reported here raised\nmany epidemiological questions and led us to reconsider the potential\nassociated risks for hare populations and public health.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThe outbreak ended in late March 2011 and the epidemiological field\ninvestigations, performed in the middle of March have been unable to\nidentify a source of infection, although they were conducted at a time\nwhen hare mortality was still observed. Molecular typing of the\nisolates recovered from collected hare carcasses and ticks will\nhopefully help us understand the origin of this outbreak by\ndetermining whether it was related to the focus (one case) reported at\na distance of 10 km [6.2 mi] in 2007. Indeed, it is highly important\nto determine whether the epizootic form of this outbreak was due (i)\nto the emergence of a novel _F. tularensis_ strain, (ii) to the fact\nthat the hare population was unusually abundant, in which case the\noutbreak may have been a density-dependent phenomenon, or (iii) to\nparticular ecologic circumstances favouring hare-to-hare transmission,\nsince the outbreak occurred during periods of frost (which may have\nled the hares to take refuge in the woods) and coincided with the\nmating season (when hares are immunosuppressed and in close contact\nwith each other). Further studies are planned, including histology and\nsurveillance of ticks and rodents, to gain knowledge on the\ntransmission route and on the maintenance of a disease in the area.\n\nThe epizootic focus will be carefully surveyed this year [2011] and\nhunters, people walking in the forest, and physicians will be warned\nthat a potential risk of disease transmission exists in the area,\nrespectively by the departmental federation of hunters involved in the\nSAGIR [surveillance of wildlife diseases] network, local authorities,\nand the regional agency of health. We wish to warn wildlife managers\nthat aggregated cases of hare mortality may be due to _F. tularensis_\nand that systematic precautions should be taken to make sure that\nhumans do not contract the disease. Human tularaemia is usually\nsporadic in France even if aggregate cases have been described.\nInfected ticks like those found alive on dead hares may become a\nreservoir in the area, thus the potential for human infection is now\nhigher than it was. As the wood is highly frequented, tularaemia\nshould be considered in the area as a diagnosis, particularly in\npeople with contact with hares or ticks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The timeline of the epidemiological investigation in France is\navailable at\nhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V16N28/Decor_Fig.jpg.\n\nTularemia, an OIE notifiable disease, is a zoonosis caused by\n_Francisella tularensis_. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits\nand hares) and rodents, especially microtine rodents such as voles,\nvole rats, and muskrats, as well as in beavers. In addition, a wide\nvariety of other mammals, birds, amphibians, and invertebrates have\nbeen reported to be infected.\n\nTularemia occurs endemically in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease\ncan occur as epizootic outbreaks in many countries in North America\nand Europe, while it occurs only as sporadic cases in some other\ncountries in Europe and Asia. It is rarely reported from the tropics\nor the Southern Hemisphere. Several epizootic outbreaks have been\nreported as a result of importation of subclinically infected\nlagomorphs.\n\nThe clinically most relevant 2 types of _F. tularensis_ are\nrecognised on the basis of culture characteristics, epidemiology, and\nvirulence. _Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is\nmainly associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is primarily\ntransmitted by ticks or biting flies, or by direct contact with\ninfected lagomorphs. It is highly virulent for humans and domestic\nrabbits and most isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp.\n_palaearctica_ (type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers,\nmuskrats) and voles in northern North America, and in lagomorphs\n(hares) and rodents in Eurasia. It is primarily transmitted by direct\ncontact or by mosquitoes, but may be transmitted through inhalation or\nthrough infected water or food. It is less virulent for humans and\ndomestic rabbits and does not ferment glycerol.

Type B tularemia is endemic to the Northern Hemisphere, and cases predominately occur in latitudes 30 degrees N-71 degrees N (1,2). We report a case of ulceroglandular tularemia in a human in Tasmania, Australia (latitude 42 degrees S) who was bitten by a ringtail possum (_Pseudocheirus peregrinus_)\nhttp://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/9/11-1856-f1.htm.\n\nThe case\n--------\nIn February 2011, a 44-year-old woman was bitten on her right index finger by a wild ringtail possum near the Henty River on the western coast of Tasmania. The incident occurred in daylight, and the possum, normally nocturnal, appeared lethargic and unwell. The patient was immunocompetent and had never traveled outside of Australia.\n\n3 days later, an ulcer developed at the site of the bite, followed by the development of swollen and tender epitrochlear lymph nodes, fever, rigors, myalgias, and drenching night sweats. On day 4, the patient was prescribed oral beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs by her local doctor. She took these for 2 weeks without clinical improvement. Axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable on day 14, and by day 17 the epitrochlear nodes had formed a spontaneously discharging sinus. A swab sample was collected from the primary ulcer site on day 17. No organisms grew after a 48-hr incubation at 36 degrees C in the following culture media: blood agar in ambient air, MacConkey agar in ambient air, and chocolate agar in 5 percent CO2. The patient's antimicrobial drug regimen was altered empirically to ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875 mg/125 mg twice a day for the next 4 weeks. Despite mild improvement in symptoms, epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenitis with suppuration persisted. Swab samples collected for fungal and mycobacterial culture from the epitrochlear sinus on day 30 were culture negative. On day 47, the patient was referred to the Royal Hobart Hospital in Tasmania. Histology from an excisional biopsy of the epitrochlear sinus on day 50 revealed acute inflammation and a few non-necrotizing epithelioid granulomas. This tissue and an axillary lymph node aspirate were sent to a reference laboratory for molecular studies.\n\nIn the reference laboratory, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the axillary aspirate by using primers targeting the U1, U3, and U5 regions. The resulting 1,331-bp amplicon (GenBank accession no. JQ277265) demonstrated 100 percent homology with 16S rRNA gene sequences from _F. tularensis ssp. tularensis_ and _holarctica_ stored in GenBank. PCR and sequencing of the recA gene (3) confirmed _F. tularensis_ (GenBank accession no. JQ277266). Amplicons of 16S rRNA and recA genes were aligned with reference sequences from the GenBank/European Molecular Biology Laboratory/DNA DataBank of Japan databases and with sequences from 2 previous _Francisella spp_. reported from Australia (4). The 16S rRNA and recA gene sequences showed 100 percent query coverage and an Expect value of 0.00 in BLASTn (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with 36 submissions of _F. tularensis_ genomes (Figure 2 [see original URL for the figure]). The unrooted bootstrap consensus tree generated from sequence alignment of the recA gene sequence, coupled with the neighbor-joining method, suggested homology between _F. tularensis ssp. holarctica_ and the organism responsible for this patient's illness. Sequencing of the region of difference 1 (5) by using previously validated primers (3) indicated the region of difference 1 size was 835 bp, closely approximating the 840-bp size associated with _F. tularensis ssp. holarctica_ biovar _japonica_.\n\nLymph node aspirate from the patient cultured in horse blood and in blood cysteine and chocolate media with and without supplement (BBL IsoVitaleX Enrichment; Becton, Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD, USA) produced no growth after 2 weeks of incubation (37 degrees C, 5 percent CO2); the control strain of _F. tularensis_ live vaccine strain grew within 3 days. We used reagents and protocols from the Laboratory Response Network, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to perform real-time PCR for _F. tularensis_. The procedure amplified 2 of 3 targets (FT2 and FT3). IgG and IgM against _F. tularensis_ antigens were detected by use of ELISA (Virion-Serion, Wurzburg, Germany) in serum obtained 2 months after the onset of symptoms in concentrations of 147.13 and 222.74 U/mL, respectively (positive cutoff >15 U/mL). Confirmatory serology for _F. tularensis_ was performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vector-borne diseases laboratory (Fort Collins, CO, USA) on serum samples collected 56 and 75 days after symptom onset. Both specimens were positive for _F. tularensis_, evidenced by a microagglutination titer of 128 (positive cutoff greater than 128). On the basis of these results, the patient was treated with a 14-day course of intravenous gentamicin. Her symptoms resolved promptly, and the woman remained well at a 6-month follow-up visit.\n\nThis case demonstrates the well-recognized features of _F. tularensis ssp. holarctica_ infection as described from the Northern Hemisphere. The mode of transmission, incubation period, clinical syndrome, lack of response to beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs, and response to aminoglycoside therapy are all characteristic of type B tularemia (6). Although a clinical response to ciprofloxacin could have been expected, treatment failures have been reported when initiation of therapy is delayed (7). The lack of growth on blood and chocolate agar is also consistent with ssp. _holarctica_ and contrasts with ssp. _novicida_ and _F. philomiragia_ (4,6). The inability to culture an organism on specialized media probably was caused by prolonged ciprofloxacin treatment before the specific culture attempt. This case met the definition for probable tularemia according to the 2007 WHO guidelines (8); however, the combination of clinical, serologic, and molecular evidence strongly supports the diagnosis of infection with _F. tularensis ssp. holarctica_. This conclusion is consistent with recent reports of tularemia in which case definitions included a compatible clinical syndrome and positive _F. tularensis_ real-time PCR or DNA sequencing (9,10).\n\nCases of human infection with other Francisella species have been reported from Australia (4). _F. philomiragia_ was isolated from a lymph node in a child in Victoria with chronic granulomatous disease, and a novicida-like organism was cultured from the toe of a 53-year-old man after a cut received in brackish water in the Northern Territory. In contrast to type A and B tularemia, these organisms are rare human pathogens and are not associated with arthropod vectors or animal hosts.\n\nMore than 300 species of mammals, birds, invertebrates, and amphibians are currently recognized as being susceptible to type B tularemia (1). This report adds the ringtail possum, found widely throughout Australia, to the list of species that are susceptible to tularemia and have transmitted this pathogen to humans. Although transmission of tularemia is most often associated with species from the orders Lagomorpha and Rodentia, human infection following contact with marsupials has long been recognized. Within the USA, opossum-to-human transmission was described as early as 1929 (11).\n\nThe discovery of _F. tularensis_ in this remote location of Australia raises questions about possible routes of spread and natural reservoirs of tularemia. Tularemia has emerged several times in nonendemic areas after the importation of infected wildlife (12) or changes in ecologic and climate conditions (13), or in settings of postwar social disruption (14); but no such recent events have occurred in Tasmania. An alternate possibility is introduction of tularemia to Australia by water birds migrating from Southeast Asia that, if infected, have the potential to contaminate surface waters with _F. tularensis_ (15).\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThis case provides evidence of type B tularemia in Australia and should alert physicians and veterinarians working within the region to the possibility of infection with this organism. The transmission of _F. tularensis_ to a human host after the bite of an animal native to Australia suggests an ecologic niche for this bacterium in the forests of western Tasmania. Further research is necessary to elucidate the role that ringtail possums, small mammals, ticks, tabanid flies, and mosquitoes prevalent in this unique location might play as natural reservoirs for and vectors of _F. tularensis_.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In 2009 and 2010 4 and\n8 cases respectively were reported from central Norway.\n\nTularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _F.\ntularensis_. 4 _F. tularensis_ subspecies are recognized:\n_tularensis_, _holarctica_, _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_. In Europe,\nthe infection is due to subspecies _holarctica_, which causes in\ngeneral less severe disease than subspecies _tularensis_, which is\ncommon in North America. Several vectors may be involved in\ntransmitting the disease to humans, commonly rodents and hares, but\ninfection may also be transmitted via insect bites (1).\n\nSeveral clinical forms are recognised, with oropharyngeal and\nulceroglandular disease being the most common clinical presentations\nin Norway (2). Oropharyngeal disease is commonly associated with\ncontaminated food and water, while ulceroglandular forms are more\noften seen when there has been skin contact with infected animals or\nafter insect bites (3).\n\nOutbreaks of oropharyngeal tularemia have previously been reported\nfrom several European countries (3,4). Tularemia is a notifiable\ndisease in Norway and during the past 10 years, 3 outbreaks were\nreported in Norway (5-7) and all were associated with water sources in\nareas where dead lemmings (_Lemmus lemmus_) had been observed\npreviously. From 2001 to 2010, between 3 and 66 cases of tularemia\nwere reported annually in the whole country, with an increase from 16\nto 32 cases on average (data available from http://www.msis.no).\nThis increase may in part be explained by the outbreaks mentioned\nabove.\n\nDiagnosis and clinical presentation\n-----------------------------------\nIn the outbreak described here, the most common clinical presentation\nwas fever and pharyngitis (oropharyngeal type, 21 cases) and cervical\nlymphadenopathy (glandular/ulceroglandular type, 10 cases). Among the\nremaining 8 tularemia cases, 2 were classified as respiratory and 2 as\ntyphoid type, while 3 were asymptomatic and clinical information was\nunavailable for 1 case.\n\nThe diagnosis was primarily established by serology\n(microagglutination and an in-house IgG/IgM Elisa) in 30 patients (8),\nby _F. tularensis_ specific PCR analysis in seven patients (9) and by\nblood culture (BactAlert, BioMerieux) in 2 patients. The 2 bacterial\nisolates were verified as _F. tularensis_ by PCR and sequencing of the\n16S rDNA gene, and confirmed as non-subspecies _tularensis_ by pdpA\nPCR (10).\n\nOf the 39 diagnosed cases, 34 had been drinking water from a private\nwell or a stream. _F. tularensis_ DNA was detected by PCR in filtered\nwater from 5 different wells tested in Sor-Trondelag. 7 cases in 1\nmunicipality were linked to the same water source. Apart from that,\nonly 2 cases have been confirmed to share a common well so far.\nFollow-up serology has been recommended for several of the persons\nexposed to some of the putative water sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe current outbreak involves a large number of municipalities in 3\ncounties in central Norway. The clinical presentation with\noropharyngeal tularemia and cervical lymphadenopathy linked to the use\nof private wells in the winter season makes contaminated water the\nmost likely source of infection in this outbreak. Detection of _F.\ntularensis_ DNA by PCR analyses in some of the wells supports this\nassumption for some of the cases. Use of private wells is relatively\ncommon in rural areas of Norway although exact data on such use are\nnot available.\n\nThe precise mechanism of contamination of the wells with _F.\ntularensis_ is as yet unknown. However, November and December 2010\nwere unusually cold months, while in January 2011 temperatures\nincreased leading to melting of snow and possible contamination of\nprivate wells by surface water contaminated with bacteria from rodent\ncadavers or rodent excreta. Since the incubation period for tularemia\nmay be up to 3 weeks, and time from symptoms until seroconversion\nmight be up to 6 weeks, more cases may follow.\n\nTularemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague' and this clearly indicates rodents and hares as\ntransmitters of disease. Years with a great increase in the rodent\npopulation are seen with intervals of about 3 to 4 years (11) and in\nthe summer and autumn of 2010, a high density of lemmings could be\nobserved in the southern and central parts of Norway. Simultaneously,\nthe Norwegian Veterinary Institute observed a wide geographical\ndistribution of fatal cases of tularemia in the mountain hare (_Lepus\ntimidus_) in these regions (12). The mountain hare is very susceptible\nto this infection and normally dies from septicemia within a few days\nafter exposure.\n\nThe use of small streams and private wells as a source of drinking\nwater and for other purposes in rural areas of Norway is a matter of\nconcern. In existing guidelines issued by the National Institute of\nPublic Health the population is advised to boil drinking water and\ninspect the wells for dead rodents in case of suspected or confirmed\ncases of waterborne tularemia. Every well owner should make the\nnecessary effort to prevent small rodents from entering the well water\nby carefully covering every opening and plugging every small hole\nwhere the rodents can enter. It is also important to secure the well\nfrom contamination by surface water after snow melting. In case of\nproven or suspected contaminated wells, the water should be\ndisinfected before further use. However, this may not be feasible for\npersons who use drinking water from a stream. The Norwegian Food\nSafety Authority has recently released information to the media and to\nthe general public with similar advice and information in relation to\nthe current outbreak. The local health authority in each municipality\nis responsible for instituting infection control measures including\nadvice to the public and investigations of the putative drinking water\nsources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In 2010. a total of 21 cases of the disease across\nthe country were reported. Tularemia, sometimes called hare plague,\nis a bacterial disease that every few years causes local outbreaks\namong rabbits and rodents, particularly in lemmings. Humans can\nbecome infected through direct or indirect contact with sick, dead,\nor disease-carrying animals.\n\nTularemia can also be transmitted through contaminated drinking water\nwhen animal tissue has contaminated the water source. The disease can\nalso spread through the bite of such animals and by inhalation of\ndust with infected feces or urine.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The form of tularemia that occurred in these cases (that is,\nulceroglandular, oculoglandular, typhoidal, or pneumonic) is not\nstated. Although classically transmitted to man via infected animals\nsuch as rabbits or a tick vector, infection with _Francisella\ntularensis_ may be acquired from contact with soil or water harboring\nthe bacterium. Although tularemia pneumonia is the form of the\ndisease associated with biological terrorism, it may also occur\nnaturally, as is exemplified by rare sporadic cases in New York City\nand outbreaks among gardeners on Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts).\n\nRegarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64\ncases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49\ncases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),\nand an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to\ncontamination of a water supply (3).\n\nAt present, no licensed tularemia vaccine is available in the USA.\nHowever, the LVS (live vaccine strain) vaccine is available to\nmilitary personnel under an investigational new drug protocol held by\nthe US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (4). It\nis administered via scarification using multiple punctures of a\nbifurcated needle. LVS is derived from strain 15 developed in the\nformer USSR and was obtained by the US military in 1956 (5). It is\nnot well standardized and contains 2 phenotypes of _F. tularensis_,\nonly one of which seems immunogenic (6). However, in studies\npublished in 1977, the vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the\nincidence of typhoidal tularemia in US government lab workers from\n5.7 to 0.27 cases per at-risk employee years (7). It did not reduce\nthe incidence of the ulceroglandular form, but the disease in\nvaccinees was reported to be milder.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Rodents and wild game\nanimals as well as mosquitoes, deer flies, and ticks, can carry\ntularemia, which is commonly known as rabbit fever, he said. 15\npercent of the feral hogs from the 2 Central Texas counties and 50\npercent of those from Crosby County showed evidence of current or past\ninfection, he said.\n\n'We have found high levels of antibodies in these pigs that show they\nhave been infected with _Francisella tularensis_ and found that some\nof these pigs were actively infected with it,' Presley said. 'The\nbacteria are constantly present in animals in this area and in the\nferal hog population, but normally it's only a small number of cases.\nThis is a huge number of infected animals.'\n\nWhat the researchers have yet to determine is the subspecies of\nbacteria infecting the hogs. The type B subspecies can cause illness\nin wildlife, domestic animals, and humans, but poses a less serious\nhealth threat to humans, Presley said. But the type A subspecies can\nbe lethal to humans, he said, and the US Centers For Disease Control\nand Prevention [CDC] considers it a viable bio-weapons agent.\n\nRegardless of which type it turns out to be, Presley says anyone who\nmay come into contact with wild animals -- especially those that might\nhunt or eat wild hogs -- should be cautious. 'If you are handling,\ncleaning, or eating wild game, particularly hogs, deer, or rabbits,\nyou should be wearing rubber gloves and eye protection when you're\ndressing wild game,' he said. 'The bacteria can enter any sort of\nsmall cut or hangnail. During this time of year, it might not be as\nbig of an issue, but you should check yourself for ticks, wear tick\nrepellent, and avoid biting flies, including mosquitoes.' Presley also\nrecommends making sure game meats are thoroughly cooked before eating\nthem and says homeowners and lawn care professionals should look for\nwild rabbit nests hidden in tall grasses prior to mowing. [There was a\ncase in Washington of a man running over an infected rabbit while\nmowing his grass and getting exposure, presumably from inhalation of\naerosolized carcass -- see ProMED 2005 archive below. - Mod.PC]\n\nThe discovery was made while the researchers were looking for\nbrucellosis. They found no evidence of that disease, and were\nsurprised to find evidence of tularemia, said Brad Dabbert, associate\nchairman of Texas Tech's Department of Natural Resources Management.\n'Traditionally, it's a rabbit disease, but it does get reported in\nbirds and other mammals,' Dabbert said. 'Since hogs can range over\nlarge areas, it's certainly possible that they can transport this\nstuff. That's kind of the critical issue now. The other thing we're\ntrying to do is look for it in other animals now to more accurately\nanswer that question,' he said.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2008, only 8 human cases of tularemia were reported\nin the state and about 125 are reported each year in the USA, Texas\nTech said Monday [24 Jan 2011]. Texas AgriLife Extension Service says\nferal hogs can be found in 230 of Texas' 254 counties and cause annual\ndamage of nearly USD 400 million.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever and deerfly fever, is a\nbacterial zoonosis caused by the Gram negative coccobacillus\n_Francisella tularensis_. The organism can infect humans and more than\n300 species of domestic and wild animals, including 25 species of\nbirds and several species of amphibians and reptiles. Water can also\nbecome contaminated from animals infected with tularemia and cause\nhuman infections. In 1982, 49 cases of oropharyngeal tularemia were\nidentified in Italy. The case distribution suggested the individuals\nhad consumed unchlorinated water in which a dead rabbit with _F.\ntularensis_ was found. Another waterborne transmission of tularemia\noccurred in 1998 on 19 persons in contact with river-caught crayfish\nin Spain.\n\nWild mammals are the primary hosts of _F. tularensis_, especially\nspecies within the orders Lagomorpha [rabbits], Rodentia [rats and\nmice], and Sciuromorpha [squirrels]. Sheep are the domestic mammal\nmost commonly associated with tularemia, but within recent years\ndomestic cats have become an increasing source for human cases of this\ndisease. In swine, infections are primarily in young animals, due to\nbites from infected ticks and from eating infected rodents. It is\ngenerally accepted that ticks are of major importance in maintaining\nthe enzootic foci of tularemia.\n\nInfections in humans are not contagious and most often result from\ncontact with infected wildlife, ingestion of, or contact with\ncontaminated water, or bites from ticks and other arthropods that have\nfed on infected wildlife. The disease in humans is nationally\nnotifiable in the United States and has been reported in every state\nexcept Hawaii. Type A tularemia infection in humans is a moderately\nsevere disease that follows a well-described course leading to the\ndevelopment of one of several clinical syndromes dependent on the\nroute of exposure, dose, and virulence of the infecting organism.\nPrior to the use of antibiotics for the treatment of tularemia,\ninfection resulted in death in 5 to 15 percent of the cases within\nNorth America; this has fallen to 1 to 3 percent during recent years\nand now averages less than 2 percent. However, untreated cases of\ntularemia that progress to systemic infections may result in severe\ndisease with high rates of fatality. Outside of the USA, human deaths\nrarely exceed one percent because of the less virulent forms of _F.\ntularensis_ present. Immunity following clinical disease is usually\nlifelong.\n\nPortions of the information above on tularemia in wildlife were\nextracted from the excellent USGS Circular 1297 Tularemia book, which\nsubscribers are suggested to consult for further details\n(<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/tularemia/>).\n\nFeral hogs (_Sus scrofa_) are an Old World species belonging to the\nfamily Suidae. They were probably introduced by Spanish explorers 300\nyears ago as a source of meat and were later crossbred with European\nwild boar introduced as game animals in the 1930's. Feral hogs are\nomnivorous, capable of eating both plant and animal matter as\nopportunity changes through the seasons. Food includes grasses,\nflowering plants, roots and tubers, browse, mast [tree fruit such as\nacorns], fruits, bulbs and mushrooms. Animal matter includes\ninvertebrates (insects, snails, earthworms, etc.), reptiles,\namphibians, and carrion, as well as live mammals and birds if given\nthe opportunity. This varied feeding habit and diet makes the feral\nhogs susceptible to inhalation of _F. tularensis_ in the environment\nfrom digging and browsing the grounds around infected animals and\nparticularly direct ingestion of carrion infected with tularemia.\n\nFeral hogs are prolific breeders, with sows reaching sexual maturity\nat 7 or 8 months, normally bearing litters of 4-5 young, twice per\nyear. The feral hog population in Texas has been increasing\ndramatically due to many factors including intentional releases,\nimproved habitat, increased wildlife management, and improved animal\nhusbandry such as disease eradication, limited natural predators, and\nhigh reproductive potential. The current population of feral hogs in\nTexas is estimated to be over 2 million, which is approximately half\nof the total US population of the animal. Feral hogs are unprotected,\nexotic, non-game animals. They can be hunted by any means or methods\nat any time of year without season or bag limits, however a hunting\nlicense and landowner permission are required.\n\nPortions of the information above about feral hogs was extracted from\nthe Texas Parks and Wildlife website at\n<http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/nuisance/feral_hogs/>\n\nThis news report states that 15 percent of the examined feral hogs\nfrom Bell and Coryell counties and 50 percent from Crosby County show\nantibodies to tularemia, but no exact numbers are given for currently\nseroactive cases. We hope the researchers will be able to continue the\nresearch to confirm the serotype and seroactive numbers to get a\nbetter understanding of the epidemiological model and future trends.\n\nAs hunting requires being in close contact and possibly butchering and\nconsumption of feral hogs with tularemia, public awareness and\neducational programs for hunters should be of concern. As tularemia is\na treatable disease, educational programs should also include\ninformation on symptoms and diagnosis so the general public living in\nareas with feral hogs will understand and get immediate proper medical\ntreatment for tularemia.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Texas can be found at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00WR>.\nA map of the counties in Texas can be found at\n<http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/maps/texas_map.html>. - Mod.KL]\n\n[Photo of Texas feral hog:\nhttp://www.hogstoppers.com/image/pig-3-07-022_00021.jpg\n\n- Mod.JW]", "summary": "was extracted from\nthe Texas Parks and Wildlife website at\n<http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/nuisance/feral_hogs/>\n\nThis news report states that 15 percent of the examined feral hogs\nfrom Bell and Coryell counties and 50 percent from Crosby County show\nantibodies to tularemia, but no exact numbers are given for currently\nseroactive cases.

Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of\ninfected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites including\nfood and water. Aquatic animals may develop tularemia after being\nimmersed in contaminated water. Carnivores sometimes become infected\nafter ingesting a contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F. tularensis\ntularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor andersoni_, _D.\nvariabilis_, and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting flies\n(particularly deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also\ntransmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the organism is spread by\nanimal bites.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods in arthropod vectors and\nin the environment. Individual flies may carry the organism for 2\nweeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes. Viable bacteria can also\nbe found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected\nanimals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil, and\nbedbugs. This organism is highly resistant to freezing; live organisms\nhave been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at -15 deg C (5\ndeg F).\n\nRabbits and other wild rodents are the primary species affected.\nTularemia can also affect beaver and muskrats. Livestock and pets\nincluding pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish, and birds can also get\ntularemia. Sheep are especially susceptible. Cattle rarely get the\ndisease.\n\nSome animals do not show signs of disease. Illness occurs 1-10 days\nafter exposure to the bacteria. Animals may have fever, look tired, be\ndepressed, and refuse to eat. Some will have a cough, stagger from\nweakness, vomit, or develop diarrhea. Rabbits and rodents behave\nstrangely, huddle together, and have a rough looking coat. Sudden\ndeath can occur.\n\nTularemia bacteria can be found in the organs or body fluids of\ninfected animals, which contaminate the environment. The bacteria can\nlive for long periods of time (weeks to months) in soil, vegetation,\nand water and serve as a source of infection for other animals or\nhumans. Animals get tularemia by ingesting (oral) contaminated food\n(raw meat from infected animals) or drinking contaminated water. They\ncan also inhale (aerosol) the bacterium, have direct contact with it\nin contaminated environments (entry through the mucous membranes or\nbreaks/cuts in the skin), or be bitten by infected biting flies or\nticks (vector).\n\nTularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment\nor be spread by insects.

Most cases are indigenous infections. This report describes 2\nepidemiologically independent infections with _Francisella tularensis_\nsubspecies _holarctica_ detected in Berlin in February 2011 that were\nacquired in central Anatolia, Turkey. In Turkey, there have been\nrepeated tularemia outbreaks since 2000 and the disease should\ntherefore be considered as a differential diagnosis in travellers\nreturning from that country.\n\nCase description and clinical diagnosis\n---------------------------------------\nIn March 2011, 2 travelers returning from Turkey, both in their 20s,\nwere diagnosed with tularemia in Berlin, Germany. Both had stayed\nindependently in Turkey between the end of 2010 and early 2011 to\nvisit their respective families in Yozgat, central Anatolia, 218 km\n[136 mi] east of Ankara in the Ak mountains. The population of Yozgat\nin 2008 was 71 768, the province counted 492 127 inhabitants (1).\n\nBoth patients had similar general symptoms including fever,\npharyngitis, otitis and cervical lymphadenopathy, but showed different\nlocations of the ulcerations characteristic of tularemia. Both\ninfections were characterized by slow and subacute clinical\nprogression.\n\nPatient 1 stayed in Turkey between 25 Jul 2010 and 29 Jan 2011. Onset\nof symptoms was on 15 Dec 2010. Patient 2 had been in Turkey from 24\nDec 2010 to 8 Jan 2011 and fell ill on 10 Jan 2011. The patients were\ndiagnosed in mid-February 2011, after their return to Berlin. Patient\n1 was diagnosed with oropharyngeal tularemia, patient 2 with the\nulceroglandular form. The latter form is the most common expression of\ntularemia. Typical symptoms are ulcerations at the inoculation site\nlinked with regional, often purulent inflammation of the [draining]\nlymph nodes. The exact description of primary clinical symptoms is\nvery important to elucidate the transmission routes and further\nepidemiological links (2,3). Further interviews with patient 2\nrevealed additional epidemiological information: the patient and one\nof his siblings both fell ill on 10 Jan 2011, and a further sibling 2\ndays later. However, these patients remained in Turkey.\n\nLaboratory confirmation\n-----------------------\nThe detection of the pathogen by bacterial culture is difficult,\nspecial media are needed and growth is generally slow. More sensitive\nlaboratory methods like PCR are only available in a small number of\nspecialized laboratories (2,3). Laboratory confirmation for the cases\nwas available on 4 Mar 2011. The German national reference laboratory\nfor tularemia in Munich could detect _F. tularensis_ subspecies\n_holarctica_ (Jellison type B) via PCR in both cases. Specific DNA\nsequences were detected in the purulent puncture material of affected\nlymph nodes.\n\nA serological diagnosis done previously in the hospital in Berlin for\npatient 2 had shown IgG and IgM antibodies against _F. tularensis_\nlipopolysacharides. The infection in patient 1 was not proved\nserologically in the hospital, but was confirmed through specific\nantibodies in the national reference laboratory.\n\nPublic health implications\n--------------------------\nAfter the diagnoses were confirmed, information was immediately\nreported according to the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR)\nto the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). At that time, no recent data were\naccessible about the tularemia situation in Turkey. Data about\ntularemia infections related to recent travel to Turkey or to\nneighboring countries were not found.\n\nTurkish citizens are one of the larger populations with migration\nbackground in Germany. At the end of 2010 nearly 2 per cent of the\nGerman population were Turkish (1 629 480 inhabitants) (4). In Berlin\nat the end of 2009, 3 per cent of the population were Turkish citizens\n(108 000 inhabitants) (5). In addition, an unknown number of German\ncitizens of Turkish origin still have intensive contacts with their\nfamilies in Turkey and frequently travel there. Therefore, the health\nauthorities in all 16 German federal states were informed on 8 Mar\n2011 during the weekly epidemiological telephone conference (EpiLag),\nsince more imported infections in international travellers could not\nbe excluded.\n\nTo get further data about the situation in Turkey, but also to alert\nother countries, the RKI informed the Turkish IHR focal point and the\nWHO Regional Office for Europe about the infections. Furthermore,\ninformation was sent to the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS)\nof the European Union. On the national level the decision was made to\ninvolve the German National Centre for Biological Security at the RKI\nbecause the pathogen _F. tularensis_ is classified as a potential\nbiological risk agent [category A. - Mod.LL]. Overall, the risk of\nfurther transmission and the threat to public health in Germany was\nestimated as low.\n\nEpidemiological considerations\n------------------------------\nIn the past years tularaemia outbreaks in Europe were documented in\nNorway (6,7), Sweden (8), Spain (9), and the UN Administered Province\nof Kosovo in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1244 of 1999\n(10). Parts of Turkey have been strongly affected by the re-emergence\nof tularemia and a number of outbreaks have been published since 2000\n(11-16). In Germany, tularemia cases are rare, however, increasing\nnumbers have been reported since 2007. Some travel-associated\ntularemia cases have been reported in Germany (10 of 74 cases between\n2001 and 2009), but only 1 case dating back to 2003 originated from\nTurkey (17,18).\n\nThrough information exchange via the national German and Turkish IHR\nFocal Points with the General Directorate of Primary Health Care in\nthe Turkish Ministry of Health, further details were provided about\nthe current situation in Turkey and possible sources of infection\n(personal communication: Dr Tamer Sami Pelitli, 18 Mar 2011). More\nthan 100 tularemia cases were reported to the national reference\nlaboratories from central parts of Turkey, especially in the Yozgat\nprovince in 2010. The cases had been confirmed serologically and\nthrough PCR in 2 reference laboratories in Ankara and Bursa, Turkey.\nBased on this information the Ministry of Health of Turkey has\nimplemented an action plan to fight the spread of tularaemia in 2010.\nThis action plan is focused on the rehabilitation of water systems. As\na promising result the number of reported tularaemia cases decreased\nin 2011 compared with the previous years. After being informed by the\nGerman IHR Focal Point about the 2 cases in Berlin, the Turkish\nMinistry of Health started active surveillance work in the Yozgat\nprovince, but has not yet detected new transmission risks for\ntularemia.\n\nIn both cases from Berlin the source of infection could not be\nidentified conclusively. However, based on the available\nepidemiological information, the most probable cause of the 2\ninfections is consumption of contaminated water during the stay in a\nregion of Turkey endemic for tularemia. Transmission has often been\nassociated with decentralized drinking water supply like cisterns and\ninsufficiently treated surface water (15). The clinical presentation\nat least in one of the patients diagnosed in Berlin supports this\nsuggestion. Oropharyngeal tularemia is presumably related to oral\ningestion of the pathogen.\n\nClinical considerations\n-----------------------\nDue to the relatively unspecific general symptoms of tularemia and\nthe variety of the primary disease patterns (depending on the route of\ninfection) clinical diagnosis is not easy. Therefore, early suspicion\nof tularemia depends on a precise medical history and epidemiological\ndata regarding in particular travel history, animal contacts,\noccupation, and insect bites. The diagnosis should subsequently be\nconfirmed through sensitive biomolecular methods like PCR with direct\nidentification in blood, lymph node punctuates or wound swabs, and\nspecific serological tests, both of which are available in specified\nlaboratories.\n\nEarly diagnosis allows immediate therapy with effective antibiotics\nlike doxycycline or fluoroquinolones, which can be combined with\naminoglycosides in severe cases. Drugs used empirically in many cases\nof lymphadenitis of uncertain origin are cephalosporins,\namoxicillin/clavulanate, and macrolides which, however, are not\neffective against tularemia. Sometimes even surgical interventions to\neliminate a suspected tumour are performed during infection with _F.\ntularensis_. In these cases, tularaemia is frequently diagnosed only\nretrospectively by histopathological examination and/or by detection\nof _F. tularensis_-specific antibodies.\n\nClinical physicians should currently be aware of possible infections\nwith _F. tularensis_ in travelers from some regions of Turkey. In case\nof clinical signs suggestive of tularemia, effective diagnostic\nmethods should not be delayed, since diagnostic delay can easily\nresult in extended suffering of the patient. Besides addressing the\npublic health aspects of the disease, epidemiology plays a major role\nin supporting the early and effective clinical diagnosis and treatment\nof tularemia.\n\n[For the citations, please refer to the source URL above. - Mod.LL]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_F. tularensis_ can be divided into 2 clinically significant\nsubspecies, _F. tularensis tularensis_ (also known as type A or\nsubspecies nearctica) and _F. tularensis holarctica_ (also known as\ntype B or subspecies _palaearctica_). Other much less clinically\nrelevant subspecies are also described.\n\nType A appears to be the most prominent type in North America,\nprimarily endemic in rabbits, and was involved in the Martha's\nVineyard (Massachusetts) pneumonic tularemia outbreaks.

The\nreservoirs include rodents, voles, muskrats, and beavers. An\ninfectious dose of 12 000 bacilli is much more likely to produce only\nmild, self-limited disease in humans. It is not lethal in rabbits and\nguinea pigs.\n\nRegarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64\ncases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49\ncases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),\nand an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to\ncontamination of a water supply (3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

She\nemphasized, however, that 'if you see a dead rodent, don't pick it up\n-- or turn it over. If there is a cut on your arm, you risk getting infected.'\n\nThe disease, most often found in rabbit and hare populations, is\nendemic in North America, parts of Europe, and Asia; believed to have\nbeen introduced into the US in the late 19th or early 20th century,\npossibly by dogs, it was first isolated in Tulare, California.\n\nTularemia is generally transmitted via rodents and insects -- biting\nflies, which can remain infective for up to 2 weeks, and ticks, which\ncan remain infective for up to 2 years, although waterborne infection\naccounts for 5-10 percent of all cases in the US.\n\nTularemia can also be spread by direct contact with contaminated\nanimals or material, by ingestion of poorly cooked flesh of infected\nanimals or contaminated water, or by inhalation. The incubation\nperiod for tularemia is 1 to 14 days, with most infections in humans\nmanifesting in 3 to 5 days.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, symptoms of tularemia\nin humans can include sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea,\nmuscle aches, joint pain, a dry cough, and progressive weakness;\nhuman victims can also develop pneumonia, chest pain, bloody sputum,\nand breathing difficulties. Depending on the vector of exposure, more\nsymptoms can include ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful\nlymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat. Humans can\nget tularemia by being bitten by an infected tick, deer fly, or other\ninsect, handling infected animal carcasses, eating or drinking\ncontaminated food and water, and breathing in the bacteria.\n\nThe CDC reports that, while tularemia is not known to be spread from\nperson to person, anyone with the disease should be treated as soon\nas possible, since it can be fatal if not treated with antibiotics. A\nvaccine for tularemia under review by the Food and Drug\nAdministration is not currently available in the US. They recommend\nusing insect repellent 'containing DEET on the skin, and treating\nclothing with permethrin to prevent insect bites, as well as frequent\nhand-washing with soap and warm water, especially after handling\nanimal carcasses; cooking food thoroughly and only drinking water\nfrom a safe source.' It also recommends those in affected areas note\nany change in the behavior of pets (most particularly in rodents,\nrabbits, and hares) or livestock, and consulting a veterinarian if\nsymptoms appear.\n\nThe CDC's website further reports that, if the _Francisella\ntularensis_ [the causative organism of Tularemia - Mod.TG] organism\n'were used as a weapon, the bacteria would likely be made airborne\nfor exposure by inhalation. People who inhale an infectious aerosol\nwould generally experience severe respiratory illness, including\nlife-threatening pneumonia and systemic infection, if not treated.\nThe bacteria that cause tularemia occur widely in nature, and could\nbe isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory, although\nmanufacturing an effective aerosol weapon would require considerable\nsophistication,' to which end it is working to stockpile antibiotics\nfor treatment of infected persons, and to coordinate a nationwide\nprogram through which states share information about tularemia and\ncreating new education tools and programs for health professionals,\nthe public, and the media.\n\nWarning signs about the disease will be posted at the beaver pond;\ndog owners are urged to keep their animals away from the area.\n\n[Byline: Marta Tarbell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nGreg Craig <Greg_Craig@msn.com>\n\n[Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_\n(formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative,\nnon-motile coccobacillus. 2 subspecies exist: _F. tularensis\ntularensis_ (also known as Jellison type A) and _F. tularensis\nholarctica_ (Jellison type B). _F. tularensis tularensis_ is found in\nlagomorphs in North America and is highly virulent for humans and\ndomestic rabbits; _F. tularensis holarctica_ is less virulent and\noccurs in beavers, muskrats, and voles in North America and in hares\nand small rodents in Eurasia.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation,\narthropod-borne transfer, or direct contact through the skin and\nmucous membranes. Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of\ninfected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites\nincluding food and water. Aquatic animals may develop tularemia after\nbeing immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores sometimes become\ninfected after ingesting a contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F.\ntularensis tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor\nandersoni_, _D. variabilis_, and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting\nflies (particularly deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also\ntransmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the organism is spread\nby animal bites.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods in arthropod vectors and\nin the environment. Individual flies may carry the organism for 2\nweeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes. Viable bacteria can also\nbe found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected\nanimals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil, and\nbedbugs. This organism is highly resistant to freezing; live\norganisms have been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at -15\ndeg C (5 deg F).\n\nRabbits and other wild rodents are the primary species affected.\nTularemia can also affect beaver and muskrats. Livestock and pets\nincluding pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish, and birds can also get\ntularemia. Sheep are especially susceptible. Cattle rarely get the disease.\n\nSome animals do not show signs of disease. Illness occurs 1-10 days\nafter exposure to the bacteria. Animals may have fever, look tired,\nbe depressed, and refuse to eat. Some will have a cough, stagger from\nweakness, vomit, or develop diarrhea. Rabbits and rodents behave\nstrangely, huddle together, and have a rough looking coat. Sudden\ndeath can occur.\n\nTularemia bacteria can be found in the organs or body fluids of\ninfected animals, which contaminates the environment. The bacteria\ncan live for long periods of time (weeks to months) in soil,\nvegetation and water and serve as a source of infection for other\nanimals or humans. Animals get tularemia by ingesting (oral)\ncontaminated food (raw meat from infected animals) or drinking\ncontaminated water.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, symptoms of tularemia\nin humans can include sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea,\nmuscle aches, joint pain, a dry cough, and progressive weakness;\nhuman victims can also develop pneumonia, chest pain, bloody sputum,\nand breathing difficulties. \n\nTularemia is generally transmitted via rodents and insects -- biting\nflies, which can remain infective for up to 2 weeks, and ticks, which\ncan remain infective for up to 2 years, although waterborne infection\naccounts for 5-10 percent of all cases in the US. Humans can\nget tularemia by being bitten by an infected tick, deer fly, or other\ninsect, handling infected animal carcasses, eating or drinking\ncontaminated food and water, and breathing in the bacteria. Communicated by:\nGreg Craig <Greg_Craig@msn.com>\n\n[Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_\n(formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative,\nnon-motile coccobacillus. Viable bacteria can also\nbe found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected\nanimals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil, and\nbedbugs. They can also inhale (aerosol) the bacteria, have\ndirect contact with it in contaminated environments (entry through\nthe mucous membranes or breaks/cuts in the skin), or be bitten by\ninfected biting flies or ticks (vector). Town officials have alerted the Telluride Veterinary Clinic and the\nTelluride Medical Center to the outbreak of the disease, more\ncommonly known as 'rabbit fever' or 'deer fly fever,' which can be\ntransmitted to animals and humans, most frequently by ticks and deer flies. The bacteria\ncan live for long periods of time (weeks to months) in soil,\nvegetation and water and serve as a source of infection for other\nanimals or humans. Vectors for _F.\ntularensis tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor\nandersoni_, _D. variabilis_, and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting\nflies (particularly deerflies). \n\nThe disease, most often found in rabbit and hare populations, is\nendemic in North America, parts of Europe, and Asia; believed to have\nbeen introduced into the US in the late 19th or early 20th century,\npossibly by dogs, it was first isolated in Tulare, California. It also recommends those in affected areas note\nany change in the behavior of pets (most particularly in rodents,\nrabbits, and hares) or livestock, and consulting a veterinarian if\nsymptoms appear. Tularemia can also be spread by direct contact with contaminated\nanimals or material, by ingestion of poorly cooked flesh of infected\nanimals or contaminated water, or by inhalation. Animals get tularemia by ingesting (oral)\ncontaminated food (raw meat from infected animals) or drinking\ncontaminated water. \n\n_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation,\narthropod-borne transfer, or direct contact through the skin and\nmucous membranes. [26 Apr 2010] that 2 of the 4 beavers\nfound dead in Telluride's Beaver Pond last week [week of 19 Apr 2010]\nhave tested positive for tularemia.

In the early 20th\ncentury, a Japanese physician named Hachiro Ohara described a disease\naffecting those who hunted or ate rabbit. The Japanese called it\nYato-Byo, meaning rabbit fever, which appeared to be endemic to the\nAbakuma Mountains. He recorded that during certain seasons, dead\nrabbits were seen in great numbers, and human infection resulted from\ncontact with dead or diseased rabbits. He then took some blood from\nan affected rabbit and rubbed it on his wife's skin. Within days,\naccording to Ohara's report, a large ulcer appeared, and she\nexperienced clinical symptoms similar to those of people exposed in\nnature. Decades later, Ohara recognized that there were clinical\ndifferences between the Yato-Byo observed in Japan and the tularemia\nobserved in the United States.\n\nIn 1910, a Utah physician, RA Pearse, described deer-fly fever. In\n1911, George W. McCoy and Charles W. Chapin, from the US Public\nHealth Service, began examining thousands of rats and ground\nsquirrels in order to detect foci of suspected plague infections in\nSan Francisco. Early in the investigation, McCoy noted that they had\n'encountered an infection with lesions which are readily mistaken for\nthose of plague. ... It is barely possible that we unknowingly have\ndealt with more than one disease entity, as no etiological agent has\nbeen discovered.' A year later, they isolated the causative organism\nof this plague-like disease from California ground squirrels and\nnamed it _Bacterium tularense_ after Tulare County where the work was\nperformed. In addition, McCoy and Chapin developed agglutination and\ncomplement fixation tests to aid in the diagnosis. The 1st\nbacteriologically confirmed case of human tularemia was reported in\nCincinnati in 1914.\n\nDr. Edward Francis, also from the US Public Health Service,\nestablished the cause of deer-fly fever as _Bacterium tularense_ in\n1928. Because of his extensive contributions to the knowledge of the\nbacterium and the disease, the organism was later renamed\n_Francisella tularensis_.\n\nTularemia, occurs naturally all over the United States and other\nparts of the world but is particularly common in the Western and\nCentral United States, in places like California, Arizona, New Mexico\nand Colorado, where this report comes from.

Since fleas spread\nplague from infected animals to healthy ones (and occasionally to\nhumans as well), officials ordered a flea suppression campaign that\nentailed applying insecticides to prairie dog colonies over an area\nof about 11 000 acres. In addition, black-footed ferrets were\ncaptured and given plague vaccinations.

These are diseases\nspread by wild rodents, which serve as a reservoir for humans. In the\nwestern part of the US, they are often spread by prairie dogs, ground\nsquirrels and other small ground rodents. These diseases can happen\nalmost anywhere, but we frequently see the problems in the western\nregion of the US.\n\nPlague results from infection by _Yersinia pestis_, a non-motile,\nfacultatively intracellular, Gram negative rod (family _Enterobacteriaceae_).\n\nPlague is usually spread between rodents or humans by the bites of\ninfected fleas. Vectors include a variety of rodent fleas,\nparticularly the oriental rat flea (_Xenopsylla Cheopis_). In the\nU.S., the most common vector is _Oropsylla Montana_, a flea often\nfound on California ground squirrels, rock squirrels, and sometimes\nother rodents including prairie dogs. Human fleas (_Pulex irritans)_\nmay also carry _Y. pestis_. _Y. pestis_ is also present in the\ntissues and body fluids of infected animals; these bacteria can be\ntransmitted directly through mucous membranes and broken skin.\nAerosols from people or animals with the pneumonic form are\ninfectious, and animals may transmit bacteria in bites. Carnivores\noften become infected when they eat diseased rodents.\n\nPrairie dogs are considered to be sensitive indicators of plague and tularemia.\n\nTularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_\n(formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative,\nnon-motile coccobacillus. Two subspecies exist: _F. tularensis\ntularensis_ (also known as Jellison type A) and _F. tularensis\nholarctica_ (Jellison type B). _F. tularensis tularensis_ is found in\nlagomorphs in North America and is highly virulent for humans and\ndomestic rabbits; _F. tularensis holarctica_ is less virulent and\noccurs in beavers, muskrats and voles in North America and in hares\nand small rodents in Eurasia.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation,\narthropod-borne transfer or direct contact through the skin and\nmucous membranes. Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of\ninfected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites\nincluding food and water. Aquatic animals may develop tularemia after\nbeing immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores sometimes become\ninfected after ingesting a contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F.\ntularensis tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor\nandersoni_, _D. variabilis_ and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting\nflies (particularly deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also\ntransmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the organism is spread\nby animal bites.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods in arthropod vectors and\nin the environment. Individual flies may carry the organism for 2\nweeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes. Viable bacteria can also\nbe found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected\nanimals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil and\nbedbugs.

Our rabbit\npopulation cycles up and down every few years and has recently been\nfairly high, at least in the northern part of New Mexico. When the\npopulations are high we tend to see die offs due to both tularemia\nand plague. This can then lead to cases in cats and dogs that are\nallowed to roam and hunt, and potentially in people.\n\nWe have had laboratory confirmed tularemia in 2 rabbits, one from an\narea called La Cienega (several miles southwest of the city of Santa\nFe, picked up dead on 9 Apr 2009) and another one from just west of\nthe city limits of Santa Fe (picked up dead on 8 Apr 2009). We also\nhad a dead rabbit from the north end of Santa Fe (picked up dead on\n31 Mar 2009) that tested positive for plague, _Yersinia pestis_.\n[This is being posted, see ProMEDmail 20090415.1435. - Mod.MHJ] There\nwere no human or pet cases associated with these dead rabbits and no\nantibiotic prophylaxis was needed. We feel it is important to give an\nearly warning to the public that these diseases, while rare, are\ncirculating in the environment. We also give information to the\npublic on things they can do to help decrease their risk of being\nexposed to these diseases.\n\nIt is difficult to predict whether animal cases in early spring will\ntranslate to an increase in human cases (there was only one human\ncase of plague and one human case of tularemia in New Mexico in 2008)\nas many environmental factors come into play, especially rainfall and\ntemperature.

The patient presented to the\nhospital in early June 2008 with a one-week history of fever, headache,\nsweats, left sided pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\nPleural fluid culture yielded small, slow-growing Gram negative bacteria\nthat were referred to the New York City Public Health Laboratory for\nidentification. The organism was confirmed as _Francisella tularensis_. The\npatient reported camping in Gateway National Recreation Area in Brooklyn 4\ndays prior to the onset of his symptoms.\n\nTularemia is rare in New York City; however, cases have been reported in\nall New York City boroughs except for the Bronx. Since 1965, there have\nbeen 15 other reported cases, with the last case occurring in 2007 in a\nStaten Island child. In the USA, about 100-200 cases are reported annually,\nwith most occurring in the south, central, and western states; the case\nfatality rate is about 1.0 per cent.\n\nTularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative\nintracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts,\nnotably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers,\nand water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels,\nand cats. A USA outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs\noccurred in 2002.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and\nvegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental\nconditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as,\n_Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may\nrepresent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.\n\nHumans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental\nexposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious\nanimal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated\nfood, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case,\nbacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off\nafter entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in\nhumans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly\ninfectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can\ndevelop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease\nto others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of\none to 14 days.\n\nThe clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure.\nAirborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures\nthat penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease.\nThe onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and\nrigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza,\nand sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever,\nchills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss\ncharacterize the continuing illness.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not related to bioterrorism, tularemia is a Category A\nbioterrorism agent and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one\nassociated with intentional spread.\n\nProMED-mail thanks the Bureau of Communicable Disease of the NY City\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene for allowing posting of this case,\nnot yet in the public domain.

The patients were a forest worker (patient A) in his\n20s, and his parents, both in their 50s. Tularemia is very rare in\nGermany. From 2002 to 2006, between one and 5 cases were reported\nannually, with the exception of 2005 with 15 reported cases (1). In\n2007, 19 cases were reported, 11 of them in Baden-Wuerttemberg (2).\nIn the district in which the 3 cases occurred, no tularemia cases had\nbeen reported in recent years.\n\nCase description\n----------------\nIn late August 2007, a hare was run over by a car driven by patient A\nand the local forester. The animal was heavily injured and was put\ndown by the forester. Patient A took the dead hare home and skinned\nit together with his father on the same day. His mother then stored\nthe hare in the freezer. Three days later, patient A's father\ncomplained of influenza-like symptoms, fever of 39-40 deg C (102-104\ndeg F), headache, and joint pain. On the next day, patient A and his\nmother developed the same symptoms, and also experienced dizziness. A\n4th family member who had not been at home on the day the hare was\nskinned did not show any symptoms.\n\nOver the course of the following weeks, the 3 patients suffered\nmainly from influenza-like symptoms, and felt increasingly weak.\nPatient A's mother reported impaired wound healing with regard to a\nblister on a finger of her right hand (a possible entry site for\npathogens) that was caused by a burn and healed only after weeks.\nLaboratory investigations by the family doctor returned only\nunspecific inflammatory serum parameters. X-ray and sonography\nsupplied no evidence pointing towards a diagnosis of tularemia.\n\nIn mid-October 2007, patient A's father developed swollen lymph nodes\nin his left axilla and left elbow. The lymph node in his elbow\ndeveloped an abscess and was extirpated at the university clinic in\nUlm, Germany. Patient A and his mother also presented with swollen\nlymph nodes, the mother in the right axilla and the left elbow, the\nson in the left axilla. The resulting abscesses were removed at their\nregional hospital.\n\nThe 4th family member works at a medical diagnostic center. As the\ninfluenza-like symptoms in her family persisted for several weeks,\nshe took a serum sample from patient A's father in mid-October 2007,\nabout 2 months after he had skinned the hare, and had it analysed at\nher work-place. Two weeks later, the center detected elevated\nantibody titers against _Francisella tularensis_ in the serum: an IgG\ntiter of 1:2560 compared to normal values of under 1:40, and an IgM\ntiter of 1:160 compared to a normal of under 1:20, as measured by\nimmunofluorescence test (IFT).\n\nA positive serology for tularemia is defined as a 4-fold or higher\nincrease in specific antibodies to _F. tularensis_. The patients, as\nwell as the hospital in which patient A and his mother had been\ntreated, were informed immediately of the diagnosis indicative of\nacute or recent tularemia.\n\nLaboratory investigation\n------------------------\nThree days later, the hospital informed the district public health\nauthorities about a positive diagnosis of tularemia in a relative of\n2 patients that had been released after lymph node extirpation. At\nthe request of the district public health office, the diagnostic\ncenter sent serum from patient A's father to the German consultant\nlaboratory for tularemia in Munich. Tularemia infection was confirmed\nfor all 3 family members.\n\nThe local veterinary authorities collected the frozen hare from the\nfamily's freezer and took it to a veterinary laboratory for analysis.\nThat institute arranged for the transfer of the hare to the German\nconsultant laboratory for tularemia, where infection of the hare with\n_F. tularensis_ was confirmed in culture and with molecular techniques.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nDue to the suspicion of tularemia, the 3 patients were treated with\nantimicrobials by their family doctor immediately after the diagnosis\nby the diagnostic center. In addition, the family received advice\nfrom the local veterinary office on the necessary measures, such as\ndisinfection of the freezer. The local foresters were informed about\nthe possible infection of the hares in the area.\n\nIn January 2008, the district public health office instigated a\nfollow-up laboratory examination of the family, which was performed\nby the state public health office of Baden-Wuerttemberg with the\nfollowing result: IFT (immunofluorescence test) antibody titers (IgG\nand IgM) in the serum of the 3 family members with clinical symptoms\nhad gone down compared to the previous examination (IgG greater than\n400 U/mL; IgM greater than 500 U/mL in all 3 cases).

Subsequent\nepidemiological investigation confirmed an outbreak of tularemia.\n\nOn 22 Oct 2007, the Epidemiological Surveillance Network in Castilla\ny Leon confirmed 362 cases of tularemia, using the case definition\nand confirmation criteria agreed to by the National Network for\nEpidemiological Surveillance together with the Epidemiological and\nControl Surveillance Network for Communicable Diseases in the\nEuropean Union (1,2).\n\nA clinical picture compatible with one of the different forms of\ntularemia included:\n-ulceroglandular (cutaneous ulcer with regional lymphadenopathy);\n-glandular (regional lymphadenopathy with no ulcer);\n-oculoglandular (conjunctivitis with preauricular lymphadenopathy),\n-oropharyngeal (stomatitis or pharyngitis or tonsillitis and cervical\nlymphadenopathy);\n-intestinal (intestinal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea);\n-pneumonic (primary pneumonic disease); and\n-typhoidal (febrile illness without early localizing signs and symptoms).\n\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis:\n-isolation of _Francisella tularensis_ from a clinical specimen;\n-detection of _Francisella tularensis_ genome by PCR; or\n-demonstration of a specific antibody response in paired serum samples.\n\nCase classification of confirmed case: a clinically compatible case\nthat is confirmed by laboratory.\n\nCases were confirmed using serological techniques (microagglutination\nin 74.8 percent and tube agglutination in 25.2 percent), culture in 6\npercent or PCR in 2 percent. _F. tularensis_ subspecies holarctica\nhas been identified as the causative agent of the outbreak.\n\nThe onset of symptoms in half of the cases occurred between\nepidemiological weeks 28 (ending 14 Jul 2007) and 31 (ending 4 Aug\n2007); 81.4 percent of reported cases were males and 18.6 percent\nfemales. Some 62.5 percent of cases were concentrated in the 45 to 64\nyear old age group, although all ages were affected (6 to 88 years old).\n\nThe presentation of the disease in the cases analysed to date is\nshown in the table [the table revealed that 56.6 percent of the cases\nwere typhoidal, 16 percent ulceroglandular, 12.1 percent glandular,\n7.7 percent pneumonia and a scattering of other presentations - Mod.LL].\n\nSome 74.6 percent of the cases were treated as outpatients by general\npractitioners, while the rest required hospitalization. Patient\nrecovery in all cases was favorable, with a good response to the\nprescribed treatment and few complications. The most frequently used\nantimicrobials in this outbreak have been ciprofloxacin and\ndoxycycline, but other fluroquinolones and tetracyclines were also used.\n\nThe epidemiological surveillance showed that 33.7 percent of cases\nwere farm workers or people whose jobs involve contact with the\nenvironment (for example, gardeners and lake and reservoir\nmaintenance staff). A significant number of cases report having been\nin contact with rodents (23.5 percent), recent arthropod bites (16.6\npercent) or animals such as dogs or cats (17.4 percent), or having\nhandled crayfish (17.1 percent), taken frequent walks in the country\n(10.5 percent), having contact with livestock (9.7 percent), straw,\nmanure or alfalfa hay (5.8 percent) or having handled and/or skinned\nhares (4.4 percent).\n\nThe most frequent clinical presentation of the disease and background\nrisk factors reported suggest 2 different means of transmission\nresponsible for the outbreak; firstly and principally by inhaling the\nbacteria, a pattern seen in just over half the cases (pneumonic and\nprobably many of the typhoid forms); and secondly, through direct\ninoculation with local manifestations of the disease.\n\nMeasures taken\n-------------\nFurther cases are actively being sought. The general public and, in\nparticular, workers with high risk of exposure have been informed of\nthe disease and of preventive measures that should be taken. These were:\n- avoid contact with dead, sick or unusually behaving animals;\n- avoid the consumption of unsanitary water that has not had adequate\nsanitary control;\n- use protective clothing and repellent products to avoid bites from\ninsects and ticks,\n- use gloves and masks when handling animals;\n- do not allow children to touch dead animals;\n- ensure that the meat of wild animals is cooked through before you\neat it, as freezing does not inactivate the agent responsible for tularemia,\n- communicate to hunting and/or animal health authorities the\npresence of dead, sick or unusually behaving animals; and\n- in case of the appearance of symptoms compatible with this disease,\ncontact your doctor immediately.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nWe believe that the exposure in this outbreak has come to an end. The\nmajority of recently confirmed cases have a not recent onset of\nsymptoms. The outbreak is focused in the central areas of Castilla y\nLeon (in 5 of 9 provinces) and has not spread to all areas of\nCastilla y Leon or to other Spanish regions. Taking this and the\nspecific climatic and other conditions in the affected provinces into\naccount, we believe that a spread of this outbreak to Portugal is unlikely.\n\nTularemia has been identified as a potential agent for intentional\nrelease, but due to the fact that this outbreak occurred in a rural\narea that has fauna and crops with very particular characteristics,\nand which has also experienced previous outbreaks of tularemia, we\nbelieve it is naturally occurring. The 1st tularemia outbreak in this\nregion occurred in 1997 (3,4,6), with 534 cases, and there was\nanother in 2004 with 13 cases (5). Between 2000 and 2003, 7 cases\nwere reported in this region (5). In the 1997 outbreak, the mechanism\nof transmission was by contact, while this year [2007], inhalation\nhas been more frequent. We are still investigating this outbreak but\nbelieve that unusual climatic and environmental circumstances may\nhave contributed to it, together with the significant diversity of\nreservoirs and sources of infection that have taken part in\ntransmission (leporids, sheep, rodents, canids, haematophagus\nvectors). All these factors have probably aided the proliferation of\n_Francisella tularensis_, a bacterium that can survive for long\nperiods in water, mud and animal carcasses. We intend to undertake\nfurther studies in order to advance the knowledge of the causes of\nthis outbreak.\n\n1.

The onset of symptoms in half of the cases occurred between\nepidemiological weeks 28 (ending 14 Jul 2007) and 31 (ending 4 Aug\n2007); 81.4 percent of reported cases were males and 18.6 percent\nfemales. \n\nThe epidemiological surveillance showed that 33.7 percent of cases\nwere farm workers or people whose jobs involve contact with the\nenvironment (for example, gardeners and lake and reservoir\nmaintenance staff). \n\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis:\n-isolation of _Francisella tularensis_ from a clinical specimen;\n-detection of _Francisella tularensis_ genome by PCR; or\n-demonstration of a specific antibody response in paired serum samples. It is certainly possible that the primary vehicle for transmission to\nhumans in this outbreak was contaminated water, as aerosolization of\nthe water can cause pneumonic tularemia, and skin or mucous membrane\ncontact can cause the varied other presentations. In late June 2007, the Epidemiological Surveillance Network in\nCastilla y Leon, northern Spain, reported a series of cases in a\nrural area in the province of Palencia and in the provincial capital\ncity of Leon, labelled as 'fever of unknown origin.'

They also want to know what puts people at greater risk. Hundreds\nof people were in the area at the time of the cluster, but only a small\nnumber became ill or developed lesions, initially mistaken for a spider\nbite or staphylococcal infection, said Ilene Risk, director of the\nepidemiology bureau in the Salt Lake Valley Health Department. From Salt\nLake County alone, where more than half those in the cluster reside, 200\npeople were potentially exposed.\nLocal health officials are collecting data and interviewing people who were\ninfected, hoping to get a clue as to what puts people at greatest risk, she\nsaid.\nCDC is testing the field specimens collected as part of the investigation\nand will work with Brigham Young University to monitor flying insects in\nthe area. During a field assessment, CDC and the Salt Lake Valley Health\nDepartment set up 14 flying insect traps, 26 rabbit traps, and 150 small\nrodent traps, then collected samples for lab analysis. The CDC will lead\nmitigation efforts, should it decide they're needed.\nTularemia is a bacterial infection caused by _Francisella tularensis_,\nfound in animals, particularly rabbits. It's typically transmitted by flea,\ndeerfly, or horsefly bite, but can be spread by direct contact with an\ninfected animal (including eating meat that's not well cooked). It can be\nspread by drinking contaminated water or inhaling contaminated air, as\nwell. It doesn't pass person to person.\nPeople made ill in the cluster were at the lake between mid-June and the\n1st week of July 2007. Cases are reportable to the state, but initial\ninvestigation belongs to the area where the individual lives, not where\ninfection occurred, said Lance Madigan, spokesman for the Utah Department\nof Health. So health officials from Davis, Iron, Salt Lake, Utah, and Weber\ncounties have been involved.\nThe 1st 3 cases reported were linked to a youth camp at the lake, which\ngave public health investigators a probable location. Utah usually has a\nfew cases statewide each year, but a cluster such as this one is unusual.\nIt took public health workers less than a day to identify it as tularemia,\nthe result of what Risk calls epidemiologists who were 'hustling' and very\ngood work by the public health lab. The epidemiologists collected lab\nspecimens, interviewed those who were sick, some hospitalized and some not,\nand took samples from and pictures of the skin lesions.\nBy the 3rd interview, they'd found a pattern emerging from what had been\nnonspecific early reports: 'A group went to a conference, and several had\nbeen ill. It was not defined, and they had not had close contact or\ncompared symptoms.' But the initial reporting source, Risk said, was\n'excellent, with good locating information' so they were quickly able to\nput it together. At that point, all those who were sick were being treated\nbut not with the right antibiotics. Tularemia requires a very specific\nprotocol that includes IV and oral antibiotics and lasts about 2 weeks.\nRecovery can take a long time, Risk said.\n[byline: Lois M Collins]\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Joseph P Dudley, PhD\n[More cases are being confirmed as tularemia in this Utah cluster.

Sykes said the man probably contracted\nthe disease from a fly bite.\nTularemia, also called 'rabbit fever,' is a disease carried by\nrabbits. It can be spread to humans by biting flies [such as deer\nflies - Mod.LL] or through contact with blood from a rabbit [as well\nas being tickborne - Mod.LL].\nSykes said the man believes he was bitten by a fly at Stratton-Myers\nPark while watching the American Legion District A Tournament.\nThis is the 3rd confirmed case for Wyoming in 2007, he said. A case\noccurred in Uinta County and the other in Campbell County. The man\nwho was infected in Uinta County, claims he got tularemia while\nvisiting the Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge.\nSykes said tularemia has many symptoms depending on how it gets into\na person's system. However, since these are bites, the most common\nsymptoms are: a skin ulcer that forms by the site of infection, the\nbacteria will then spread to the lymph glands, which will swell and\nbecome painful. The treatment is simple antibiotics, Sykes said.\nAlthough 3 other Green River residents have similar symptoms, they\nwere not confirmed tularemia cases. They are being treated by private\nphysicians. The disease cannot be transmitted from person to person.\nSykes encourages everyone to continue to use bug repellent and\nreapply the repellent during their time out of doors.

The cat,\nsent to the state lab in Pierre, was found to\nhave tularemia, also known as 'rabbit fever,' a\ntick- borne disease that can infect humans, said\nSioux Falls Police Lt. Tom Olson.\nIt was 1 of 5 cats found dead in the area of\nCactus Hills mobile home park in north Sioux\nFalls during the past 6 weeks. The department's\nanimal control division received the results\nTuesday, Olson said. There could be more\nunreported cases of the disease, he said.\n'Our concern is with the number of incidents\nwe've had with dead cats that potentially some of\nthe residents up in that area may have contact\nwith the cats,' Olson said. 'And this disease can\nbe spread through the contact with the dead\nanimal.'\nJudy Buseman, city public health director, said\nthe disease is not a major threat to public\nhealth. 'This is a naturally occurring disease in\nNorth America. It shows up in all the states,'\nshe said. 'This is not a public health emergency.'\nSouth Dakota last year [2006] had 6 cases of the\ndisease in humans, with an average of 200 cases a\nyear nationwide, Buseman said.\nPeople should wear rubber gloves when handling a\ndead animal, double bag the animal for disposal\nand wear tick repellent, Olson said. The disease\nis treatable but could be fatal in humans, he\nsaid. Officers informed residents in the Cactus\nHills neighborhood Tuesday of the disease.\nPeople can become infected through tick bites, by\nhandling infected, sick or dead animals, by\ndrinking contaminated water, or by inhaling\nairborne bacteria, according to animal control\nofficials.\nTularemia in humans is treatable with antibiotics, Buseman said.\nThe Cactus Hills neighborhood has had a\nlong-standing problem with stray cats, said Bob\nRabine, who lives in the neighborhood. He has\nused city traps to catch the stray cats in his\nyard, he said. 'We've caught as many as 3 or 4 of\nthem,' Rabine said. 'They were a nuisance and our\ndog hated them.'\nThe owners of the mobile home park are supposed\nto require pet owners to register their pets, the\nEwoldts said. 'The people that own the trailer\npark have no clue that people have these\nanimals,' Barb said.\nCactus Hills owner Joe Hayes said he follows the\ncity guidelines and does his best to keep track\nof who has pets. He limits residents to 2 pets\nper mobile home. Hayes said Tuesday evening [12\nJun 2007] that he had heard about the issue from\nnews reports but had not been contacted by the\ncity. 'The city hasn't notified me, no tenant has\ncalled me to say that there is an issue,' he said.\nTularemia will present with many flu-like\nsymptoms, said Dr. Aris Assimacopoulos, director\nof infection control at Avera McKennan. Symptoms,\nhowever, must be coupled with close contact with\nan infected animal or a tick bite, and a specific\ntest should be done for the disease, he said.\nTularemia is not known to transmit from person to\nperson, Assimacopoulos said. 'It's really that\nclose contact is what it's going to take,' he\nsaid.\nThere are at least 2 antibiotics used to treat\nthe human cases of the disease, Assimacopoulos\nsaid. 'The treatment is actually fairly short,'\nhe said. 'You're talking 1 to 3 weeks.'\nWhile tularemia is not commonly seen by\nveterinarians and is not common in the pet\npopulation, the disease is devastating for cats,\nsaid Dr. Dawn Dale, with the Dale Animal Hospital\nin Sioux Falls. Infected cats can develop sores\non the skin, fever, and signs of pneumonia, or\neven look like rabies, she said. 'By the time\nyour cat is sick with it, he's probably dying\nfrom it,' Dale said. She said the animals can\nalso be treated with antibiotics.\nThe disease typically is seen in wild rabbits and\ncats, so pet bunnies are not at much of a risk,\nshe said.

While they are still awaiting lab\nconfirmation of the diagnosis, officials issued an advisory to avoid\ncontracting the infectious bacterium, which commonly causes fever and\nswollen lymph nodes. A treatable infection, tularemia usually spreads\nthrough tick and deerfly bites, but it also can be contracted through\nmosquitoes or by direct contact with an infected animal. Outdoor\nenthusiasts are advised to wear long, light-colored pants tucked into\nboots or socks and long-sleeved shirts, stay on marked trails, avoid\nwalking in tall grasses, use repellents containing DEET and avoid\ndirect contact with wild animals including their feces and carcasses.\nHealth officials advise those who believe they have infected bug\nbites to contact their physician or local health departments and\nmention tularemia. Treatments for the infection are different from\nthat typically used for skin infections.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Although the clinical manifestations in campers in the Utah outbreak\nare not described, they must have been characteristic enough of\ntularemia to warrant a presumptive diagnosis, pending laboratory\nconfirmation. Fever, chills, drenching sweats, muscle aches, malaise,\nnausea, vomiting, and weight loss usually appear 3 to 5 days after\nexposure to _Francisella tularensis_, but can take as long as 14\ndays. Other manifestations usually are specific for the mode of\ntransmission. For example, open painful sores develop where the\nbacteria entered the skin at the site of a scratch or abrasion,\nusually on the hands and fingers of hunters, or in the groin, axilla,\nand trunk in tick or deer fly-associated cases, accompanied by\nswollen, painful regional lymphadenopathy. A sore, inflamed throat\nand cervical swollen lymph nodes follow ingestion of undercooked\ninfected meat or contaminated water; abdominal pain, nausea,\nvomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally intestinal bleeding with swollen\nabdominal lymph nodes may also occur. Pneumonia may follow inhalation\nof infectious aerosols. Inhalation of an infectious aerosol is\nbelieved to be the mode of transmission if _F. tularensis_ were to be\nused as a bioweapon. A typhoidal type involves chills, high fever,\nand abdominal pain due to blood stream infection with _F. tularensis_\nin the absence of an ulcer or swollen lymph nodes. The animal source\nis usually an infected rodent or rabbit. Diagnosis is usually made on\nthe basis of positive cultures of blood or other infected material or\nserology.\nTularemia is usually treated with gentamicin or streptomycin for 7 to\n14 days, although other antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g.,\nciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or tetracyclines (minocyclne and\ndoxycycline) are also effective. If untreated, the overall death rate\nis 5-15 percent; less than one percent of appropriately treated\npatients die.\nUtah Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake in the state of Utah\n(see map of Utah at\n<http://www.enchantedlearning.com/usa/states/utah/>).\nWe await further reports from the Utah Department of Health on this\noutbreak. - Mod.ML]\n******\n[2] New Jersey\nDate: Sat 14 Jul 2007\nSource: Capemaycountyherald.com [edited]\n<http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/article/6917-tick-borne-illness-strikes-county-teenager>\n\nThe Cape May County Department of Health was notified on 12 Jul 2007\nthat a 14-year-old county resident has contracted tularemia, also\nknown as 'rabbit fever.'\nTularemia is a rare, potentially serious illness caused by the\nbacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which occurs widely in nature and\ncan affect animals, particularly rodents and rabbits. Tularemia can\nbe acquired in multiple ways: such as being bitten by an infected\ntick; handling infected animal carcasses; eating or drinking\ncontaminated food or water; or inhaling the bacteria. The signs and\nsymptoms people develop depend on how they are exposed to tularemia.\nPossible symptoms include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph\nglands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or\npneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include abrupt\nonset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry\ncough, and progressive weakness. Tularemia can be fatal if the person\nis not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\nTo minimize risk of infection, Kevin Thomas, health officer, advises\nresidents 'to cook food thoroughly and to drink water from a safe\nsource, use a DEET-containing insect repellent on the skin, and avoid\nhandling\nanimal carcasses. If contact with animal carcasses cannot be avoided,\npersons should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly with soap and\nwater after removing gloves.'\nFewer than 200 cases of tularemia are reported annually in the United\nStates, mainly in western and south central states. The last reported\nNew Jersey tularemia case occurred in September 2004 in a 31-year-old\nCape May County resident with extensive outdoor exposure history.\nNJDHSS is working closely with the New Jersey Department of\nEnvironmental Protection's (NJDEP) Division of Fish and Wildlife,\nwhich has not identified unusual animal die-off activity in the state\nto date.\nThe American dog tick and the Lone star tick, both found in Cape May\nCounty, are known to carry tularemia. To protect against all\ntick-borne disease, residents should follow these guidelines when\noutside with known ticks: Wear light-colored, tightly woven clothing\nto make it easier to spot ticks; tuck shirts into pants and pants\ninto socks; wear closed shoes/sneakers rather than open sandals. Use\na tick repellent as directed. Products should contain DEET (for\nclothing or skin) or Permethrin (for clothing only). Remind children\nto ask an adult to apply the tick repellent and do not apply to hands\nor face. Use products with less than 10 percent DEET, and always\nfollow manufacturers' directions carefully. Do not use repellents on\nchildren under 3 years of age. While outside, stay in the center of\ntrails, avoid low bushes and leafy brush, periodically check clothing\nand skin for ticks and remove. Once inside, check clothing, skin, and\nhair for ticks (take special note of a child's navel, underarm, groin\narea and behind the ears). If a tick is found, remove it carefully\nwith tweezers.\nInformation on tularemia is available at\n<http://www.state.nj.us/health/er/tularemia.shtml>,\nand information on tick-borne disease at\n<http://www.cmchealth.net>.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[The instructions on use of DEET in the news release above are\nsomewhat confusing. DEET, a broad-spectrum insect repellant, should\nbe applied to exposed, unbroken skin of adults and children, avoiding\nthe eyes and mouth (see\n<http://www.deet.com/content/htm/child.html>).\nThis is done by adults applying DEET to their hands and then\nspreading over exposed areas of the face and body of themselves and\nchildren. Do not allow children to apply the product themselves. Do\nnot apply to open wounds and scratches, and do not apply to the hands\nof small children, since they frequently put their hands into their\nmouths. Never spray DEET onto anyone's face, as it can cause eye\nirritation.\nThe higher the DEET concentration, the longer the hours of protection\nagainst insect bites, although concentrations exceeding about 30\npercent DEET offer little additional advantage. While several lower\nconcentrations of DEET formulations (20 percent-34 percent) offer 3-6\nhours of protection, an extended-release preparation of 35 percent\nDEET offers up to 12 hours of protection, (see\n<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics found no difference in safety for\nchildren between products containing 10 percent and 30 percent DEET\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm>)\nwhen used as directed but is said to recommend that repellents used\non children should contain no more than 10 percent DEET\n(<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).\nThe insect repellent products that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus,\nnot DEET, should not be used on children less than 3 years of age.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that repellents with\nDEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months old.\nDEET also can be applied to clothing made of natural fibers and nylon\nbut may destroy other synthetic fibers and plastic (such as eyeglass\nframes and watch crystals).

While they are still awaiting lab\nconfirmation of the diagnosis, officials issued an advisory to avoid\ncontracting the infectious bacterium, which commonly causes fever and\nswollen lymph nodes. Tularemia is usually treated with gentamicin or streptomycin for 7 to\n14 days, although other antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g.,\nciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or tetracyclines (minocyclne and\ndoxycycline) are also effective.

An Alamosa County\nwoman died of the same respiratory disease -- spread by infected mice\n-- earlier this month [May 2007].\nPlague killed a capuchin monkey at the Denver Zoo last week [14-20\nMay 2007], after 20 cases were discovered in tree squirrels in the\nCity Park area.\nThe bacterial disease kills about 18 people annually in the United States.\nThis spring, at least 2 cats in southwestern Colorado have tested\npositive for tularemia.\nWhen the tularemia bacteria affect humans, it is known as 'rabbit\nfever.' About 200 people come down with the fever each year.\n'In wet years, we have lots of vegetation and explosive population\nbooms in rodents,' Pape said. 'The more dense they are, the better\nthey transmit disease.'\nPlague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_ -- a form of the bacteria that\nkilled an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle\nAges. It is rare today, but about 1 in 7 people infected dies because\nthe disease is not caught early enough. Humans usually get plague\nfrom infected fleas, which pick it up from squirrels, prairie dogs,\nand other rodents, Pape said.\nPlague is always simmering in Colorado's rodent populations, Pape\nsaid, but the disease boils up into an outbreak every 5 to 10 years,\nsometimes killing off whole colonies of prairie dogs. It's usually\nduring those years that the human cases occur, he added.\n[Last week (14-20 May 2007) in Weld County, a 30-year-old man turned\nup with hantavirus, another rodent-related disease. The source of the\ninfection has not been determined, said county spokeswoman Gaye\nMorrison. It is usually caught when a person inhales dust\ncontaminated with mouse urine or feces, or through direct contact with mice.\nEarly last spring [2006], health experts discovered plague at several\nFront Range locations and feared the disease might take off, Pape\nsaid. 'Then it was hot for 6 weeks and that absolutely shut it off,'\nPape said. 'During long, hot, dry periods, fleas literally dry up and die.'\nSouthwestern Colorado stayed relatively cool last spring [2006] and\nall 4 of Colorado's human plague cases showed up in the region, said\nJoe Fowler, a registered nurse and epidemiologist for the San Juan\nBasin Health Department.

So officials at the Idaho State Department\nof Agriculture aren't sure exactly where a flock of sheep was bitten\nby ticks carrying a bacterial infection earlier this month [April\n2007]. About 300 sheep were infected with tularemia, and 10 lambs\nhave died, the department reported Friday.\n'That flock has been treated,' said John Chatburn, deputy\nadministrator with the department, declining to identify the sheep\nproducer. 'The Idaho Sheep Commission and the Idaho Wool Growers\nAssociation have notified the sheep producers in that area, and given\nthem the information on the preventive measures they need to take to\ntreat their sheep,' he said. 'The Department of Agriculture has\nnotified the veterinarians in the state that we have had a case of\ntularemia, and to be on the lookout for it.'\nTularemia rarely has been seen in Idaho in the past decade, with 3\ncases of human infection reported in the state during that time. The\ndisease is commonly carried by ticks, which bite their hosts and\ntransmit the infection. Without antibiotics, the infection can be\nfatal.\nThe Department of Agriculture is not sure why there are more ticks\nthis year than in previous years, but speculates that weather may be\nresponsible. This uptick of ticks means higher possibilities of\ninsect-borne infections. 'A number of the livestock producers in that\narea have reported higher-than-usual concentrations of ticks,'\nChatburn said. 'That would be probably due to environmental\nconditions.' Ticks tend to thrive in warm, dry regions, a description\nsouthern Idaho fits after its mild winter, he said.\nMarilyn Simunich, a veterinarian with the department, said she\nworries that the outbreak of infection could worsen, particularly if\nfarmers don't take precautions to protect themselves and their\nlivestock. Signs of infection in sheep are not always obvious, she\nsaid.\n'They don't eat, they lay down. That's how sheep are; they don't show\na lot of signs, they act like they don't want to live,' Simunich\nsaid. 'If they have a big tick infestation, they can become anemic\njust from having ticks sucking on them.'\nChatburn is asking all livestock producers to report tick\ninfestations and infected animals to their veterinarians. The vets\nwill pass those reports to the Department of Agriculture, which will\ntrack the outbreak. 'Farmers should be worried; they need to check\ntheir livestock and see if they have an inordinate number of ticks on\nthem,' he said. 'Certainly animals in the area where the high\nincidence of ticks are, are susceptible to it if they aren't treated\nto get the ticks off them.'\nIn cooperation with South Central District Health, the Department of\nAgriculture is also warning humans against the tick-borne infection.\nTicks do not jump from host to host but spread through direct contact\nwith plants or animals that are carriers.\n'Ticks potentially carry a number of diseases, and people who are out\nin areas where they could have ticks get on them certainly need to\nfollow the advice and check themselves for ticks if they're out in\nbrushy areas,' Chatburn said. He noted that ticks can carry a variety\nof diseases, from tularemia to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and that\nthese illnesses can be serious.\nCheryle Becker of District Health suggests wearing long clothing and\ntucking pant legs into shoes when you walk in desert areas where\nsagebrush grows. Afterward, thoroughly check all parts of your body,\nwith a mirror if necessary. If a tick is found, remove it carefully\nwith tweezers and watch yourself for symptoms of disease. 'If you\nfind a tick and you develop an illness with that tick bite, you need\nto have your doctor check it out,' Becker said.\nThere have been 5 Idaho cases of tularemia infection since 1995,\nBecker said, but no deaths attributed to the infection in the 25\nyears she has been with the department. Humans should take\nprecautions against contracting the infection from a tick during a\nwalk through sagebrush, Chatburn said, but they should not worry\nabout contracting it through the food chain. 'None of those\nparticular sheep in that flock had reached the food channels,' he\nsaid. 'If they had they would have been diagnosed at slaughter and\ncondemned because of the physiological changes that occur in sick\nsheep.'\n[Byline: Ariel Hansen <ariel.hansen@lee.ne>]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Tularemia is a potentially serious illness that occurs naturally in\nthe United States. It is caused by the bacterium _Francisella\ntularensis_ found in animals (especially rodents, rabbits, and hares).\nIn domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical\ninfection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at\nincreased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an\nincreased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little\nis known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in\ndomestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and\njackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North\nAmerica, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.\nThe incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals, the\ndisease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy,\nanorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with\nsepticemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased.\nCoughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and\ndeath may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best\nrecognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may\nhave up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.\nThe most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of\nnecrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen and lymph nodes.\nEnlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes is common.\nOrganisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of\nspecial media. Risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory\npersonnel is significant; special procedures and facilities are\nessential.\nTularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases\n(especially plague) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep\nshow typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation,\ntularemia or tick paralysis should be suspected. Tularemia should be\nconsidered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral\nulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.\nDiagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and\nidentification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent\nantibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute\nand convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of =1:80 by the tube\nagglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When\ntularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted to\nreduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection.\nStreptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are\neffective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and\nchloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early\ntreatment should prevent death loss. Control is difficult and is\nlimited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and\ntreatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many\norganisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available\nfor people at high risk of infection (e.g., laboratory personnel) is\ncurrently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.\nIn people tularemia can be acquired through various routes including\nbeing bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect, handling\ninfected animal carcasses, eating or drinking contaminated food or\nwater or breathing in the bacterium, _F. tularensis_. Symptoms of\ntularemia could include:sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea,\nmuscle aches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, especially under the\narms and in the groin, dry cough, an enlarging ulcerated area and\nprogressive weakness. People can also catch pneumonia and develop\nchest pain, bloody sputum and can have trouble breathing and even\nsometimes stop breathing.\nOther symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the\ntularemia bacterium. These symptoms can include ulcers on the skin or\nmouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes,\nand a sore throat. If you suspect you may have the disease or have\nsome of the symptoms, consult your physician.

Information about the clinical picture is missing for\none case at the time of submission of this report. The median age of\nthe cases is 22 years (range 2-54 years), and 7 are female. At the\ntime of notification, 2 patients had recovered, 2 were still ill, and\ninformation was missing for the remaining 5; 4 of the cases were hospitalized.\nTularemia is endemic in Norway and is caused by _Francisella\ntularensis_, which can be transmitted by rodents and hares. Large\nnumbers of dead rodents (lemmings, _Lemmus lemmus_) are currently\nreported in the affected area after a large surge in the lemming\npopulation last autumn [2006].\nInvestigation into the source of infection:\n-------------------------------------------\nClinical and epidemiological information was obtained from clinical\nnotification forms and supplemented by information from municipal\nmedical officers in the affected areas. Laboratory results were\navailable from the laboratory notification form for each case.\nSpecific antibodies were detected in the serum of all cases, using a\ncombination of agglutination and ELlSA-technique, the latter allowing\ndiscrimination between IgG and IgM response. Results from the\nanalysis of water samples were obtained by direct contact with the\nlaboratory. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on filter\npaper samples after filtration of water and was positive for _F.\ntularensis_ in samples from one of 4 tested wells.\nThe clinical manifestation of oropharyngeal tularaemia generally\nsuggests transmission by water or food (1). Because of the recent\nsurge in the lemming population, drinking water contaminated by\nrodents was, at an early stage, suspected as the most likely source\nof infection; this has also been shown to be the most frequent cause\nof infection with _F. tularensis_ in Norway (2). Three of the cases\nlive in areas with a municipal water supply, which, after technical\ninspection, was found to be an unlikely source of contaminated water.\nThese 3 cases were children aged 2 to 4 years who live in the same\nneighborhood and who have frequently been observed eating snow.\nContaminated snow is a possible source of infection for these cases.\nThe remaining 6 cases all had private wells. Water from 4 of the\nwells was analysed, one testing positive for _F. tularensis_ by PCR.\nTo our knowledge, no rodents have been tested.\nControl measures:\n----------------------\nThe public in the 3 affected municipalities have been informed by the\nmedia about the current increased risk of tularemia. People with\nprivate wells have been asked to inspect these for rodent carcasses\nand potential rodent entrances and to take corrective measures as\nrequired. Advice has been given regarding cleaning and disinfection\nof potentially contaminated wells by shock chlorination (i.e. adding\nchorine to a concentration of 30-50 mg/L for 1-2 hours) and by\nboiling of water for domestic use until corrective measures have\ntaken effect. The public has been asked to refrain from drinking\nwater that has not been disinfected or boiled while involved in\noutdoor activities such as hiking and camping.\nDiscussion:\n----------\nTularaemia in Norway is caused by _F. tularensis_ subsp. holarctica,\nwhich generally gives rise to milder disease symptoms than other\nsubspecies. Since 1978, the annual number of reported cases in Norway\nhas varied between none and 47, oropharyngeal tularemia being the\nmost common manifestation (2). Relatively few cases have been\nassociated with insect bites. This is in contrast to the situation in\nSweden and Finland, where the annual incidence generally is more than\n10 times higher than in Norway, and where insect bites are considered\nan important mode of transmission (3). Transmission by insects or by\nskin contact with rodents generally leads to ulceroglandular\ntularemia. This is characterised by an ulcer at the place of entry of\nthe bacteria through the skin with accompanying regional\nlymphadenitis and is less common in Norway than oropharyngeal tularaemia.\nTularaemia has traditionally been called both 'lemming fever' and\n'hare plague,' clearly indicating rodents and hares as transmitters\nof disease. An increase in the incidence of tularaemia has often been\nobserved in years with a surge in rodent populations or in the months\nthereafter. 2006 was a so called 'lemming year' in the affected area,\nand infected carcasses represent a potential source of infection for\nhumans who come into direct or indirect contact with these. Norway\nhas experienced several outbreaks of water-borne tularemia, the\nlargest in 2002 in the municipality of Midtre Gauldal in central\nNorway, with 11 laboratory-confirmed cases. In the present outbreak\nin northern Norway, the clinical picture of oropharyngeal tularemia\npoints to ingestion of contaminated water, or possibly snow, as the\nmost likely route of transmission. Although only one case has been\ndirectly linked to a well that was confirmed to be contaminated by\n_F. tularensis_, it is possible that water in the wells that tested\nnegative in the outbreak investigation had been transiently infected\nweeks or months earlier. However, transmission via contaminated food\nor direct or indirect contact with rodents or with cats and dogs can\nnot be excluded.\nMany Norwegians live in or own leisure homes that have private wells\nwithout water treatment systems. Also, the eating of snow and\ndrinking of water that has not been disinfected, for example from\nlakes and rivers, is common practice during outdoor activities. The\nrisk of acquiring oropharyngeal tularaemia is particularly high in\nyears with a surge in rodent populations and the months thereafter,\nwhen infected carcasses represent possible sources of infection. The\npublic should be advised to take appropriate action to reduce this risk.\n1. Tarnvik A, Priebe HS, Grunow R: Tularaemia in Europe: an\nepidemiological overview.

According to\nColonel David L. Danley, Project Manager, Joint Vaccine Acquisition\nProgram (JVAP) at Fort Detrick, data now required for licensure were\nnot adequately documented during its development, prohibiting plans\nto license the current vaccine. Because the 'old method of growth\nusing shaker culture does not meet current good manufacturing\nprocesses required for FDA licensure,' the manufacturing processes\nand potency of the current LVS vaccine are being re-evaluated, and 'a\nnew process using fermentation technology will be used,' explained\nDavid T. Dennis, MD, MPH, Chief, Bacterial Zoonoses Branch, Centers\nfor Disease Control (CDC).\nDespite the increased risk of a bioweapons threat felt after\n'September 11th', further vaccine development for tularemia remains\nslow. The projected date of a new licensed vaccine in the USA is not\nuntil 2009.\nThe current LVS vaccine is based on research that goes back to the\n1960s. It is a descendant of strain 15 developed by the former Soviet\nUnion's Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Gamalcia\nInstitute, in Moscow, and sold to the US military in 1956 (10). In\nthe early 1960s, USAMRIID had isolated the LVS strain for preventive\nuse in at-risk US military personnel (11,12). Efficacy studies in\ncivilian laboratory employees at Fort Detrick revealed that the\nvaccine was safe and significantly reduced the incidence of typhoidal\ntularemia from 5.70 to 0.27 cases per 1000 at-risk employee-years\n(13). Although the incidence of ulceroglandular tularemia was\nunchanged by the vaccines, the disease was found to be milder in the\nvaccine cohort. Worldwide, LVS has since been used as seed stock for\ntularemia vaccines (12).\nSeveral limitations of the current LVS tularemia vaccine indicate a\nneed to move forward on developing an improved vaccine. One\nlimitation is the current mode of administration, which requires\nscarification that is both cumbersome and difficult to standardize.\nFurther limitations deal with gaps in understanding the factors\nresponsible for the virulence and genetic stability of _Francisella\ntularensis_, as well as which antigens are needed to produce an\neffective cell-mediated immunity. Current research shows that only\none of the 2 phenotypes of LVS, the blue colony type, appears to be\nimmunogenic (11,12).\nA 2nd limitation is confusion over which arm of the immune system\nshould be targeted. Although it has been thought that the humoral\nimmune response is not important in protection against tularemia, a\nrelatively recent report from the Fort Detrick group has suggested\nthat this may not be the case (14). Pooled sera from humans immunized\nwith LVS were found to fully protect mice against a large lethal\nchallenge of LVS organisms. New lots of LVS produced in the USA\nclearly show immunogenicity in human volunteers, producing both brisk\ncell-mediated and humoral immune responses (15). In the future,\ntechniques to optimize the appropriate humoral response may be available.\nNew generation tularemia vaccines\n---------------------------------\nStrategies for development of a new generation of vaccines include\nidentification of individual components of _F. tularensis_, such as\nthe lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or various other outer surface proteins,\nas potential vaccine components (either native or recombinant). After\nidentification, these components would then be used as immunogens,\ninstead of using the entire organism. In laboratory studies, some of\nthese cell components have been tested and found to have variable\nprotection in mice.\nFor instance, one of the membrane proteins of the _F. tularensis_\nthat has been studied as a potential immunogen is a 17-kilodalton\nlipoprotein, TUL4. The gene for this antigen has been cloned into a\n_Salmonella typhimurium_ mutant (16). In mice immunized with this\nrecombinant vector, both humoral and cell-mediated immune response to\nthe antigen developed, and mice were protected from an LVS challenge.\nThe development of monoclonal antibodies for use as passively\nprotective agents is another possible strategy for new vaccine\ndevelopment, according to Dr. Dennis of the CDC.\nA number of investigators are conducting basic research into\ntularemia, particularly molecular and sequencing studies aimed at\nidentifying proteins and antigens for use as vaccine candidates. Most\nof this research is being conducted at military research\ninstitutions, including USAMRIID.\nAs one would expect, since 'September 11th', information on\nmanufacturers actively working on a new vaccine is scarce. In the\nUSA, DynPort Vaccine Company LLC was awarded a contract to develop,\nmanufacture, test, and license an LVS vaccine from the current\nvaccine material, according to both Dr. Dennis and Col. Danley at\nFort Detrick. DynPort has been under contract to the USA Department\nof Defense's (DoD's) JVAP since 1997 and acts as its executive arm,\nsays Terry Irgens, President of DynPort. Basic researchers from\ninstitutes such as USAMRIID work closely with DynPort, which employs\nover 100 scientists, physicians, and veterinarians to conduct\npreclinical and clinical testing of vaccines. Production and\nlicensure are also managed by DynPort, whose contract with JVAP was\nrecently extended to 2012. A proposed licensure date is June 2009, as\npreviously mentioned (17).\nInternationally, several efforts are under way to develop new\ntularemia vaccines, but with similar limited information on\nmanufacture and licensure dates. In the UK, 2 approaches to a new\nvaccine, use of defined attenuated mutants and a subunit vaccine, are\nin their earliest stages and are not anticipated for licensure in the\nUK for more than a decade, says Col. Danley.\nOther development efforts are being conducted in Sweden at the\nNational Defense Research Establishment, University of Umea, which\nrecently received a 5-year grant from the US National Institutes of\nHealth to develop a subunit vaccine against aerosolized forms of _F.\ntularensis_. In collaboration with Canadian researchers, under the\ndirection of Dr. Wayne Conlan, Medical Research Council, Ottawa,\nCanada, the grant will also compare the efficacy of these candidate\nvaccines to those of attenuated vaccines, said Dr. Anders Sjostedt,\nwho heads the research group at Umea University.\nIn Moscow, a project is under way at the Institute of Immunological\nEngineering to develop a chemical tularemia vaccine based on\npreparations of outer-membrane components of _F. tularensis_. This\ngroup is also working on a project to develop a molecular vaccine\nbased on LPS-protein complexes.

People and domestic animals can\nbecome infected through contact with the bacteria or through bites\nfrom deer flies.\nIn 2006, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has documented rabbit\ndie-offs by Newcastle and near Pumpkin Buttes in northeast Wyoming,\naccording to wildlife disease specialist Hank Edwards. Additional\ndead rabbits are being spotted across Thunder Basin National\nGrassland and into other regions of Converse County.\n'It's bad, but it's par for the course anytime you get a rabbit\npopulation that high,' said Game and Fish Warden Rod Lebert,\nstationed in Douglas. More rabbits raise the likelihood of larger\ndie-offs because the animals are more concentrated.\nSo far, 2 people in Wyoming contracted tularemia in 2006, said Jamie\nSnow, a public health veterinarian for the Wyoming Department of\nHealth. The 1st, a woman in Baggs, was bitten in the hand by a cat.\nThe feline had likely been chewing on an infected rabbit and carried\nthe disease on, Snow said. The woman had a 'pretty severe' infection\nin her hand, centered at the wound site, and has suffered some\nlasting complications. The 2nd victim was a Big Horn County teenager\nwho came down with a high fever, body ache and chills after skinning\nan infected rabbit. His illness was treated effectively with\nantibiotics, Snow said.\nAlso in 2006, so far, 3 cats, one foal and a cottontail rabbit tested\npositive for tularemia at the state veterinary lab.\nSnow urged people to stay away from all sick-looking wildlife, and to\ntake cats and dogs to a veterinarian immediately if they notice signs\nof sickness. She also promoted the normal precautions against\ndisease: Wear gloves when handling dead animals and wash hands well\nwith soap and water after contact.\nThe rabbit die-offs are likely to occur every year in various places,\nEdwards said. 'We know tularemia has been in the state for many years\n... We see a pretty constant rate,' he explained. Edwards' office\nrandomly surveys carnivores for tularemia and sees the bacteria in\nabout 20 to 30 percent of samples each year, although most carnivores\ndon't die from tularemia.\n'They act as sentinels so we can see what the level of a particular\ndisease is in the field,' Edwards said.

Tissue samples from the\nanimals were collected and submitted to the CDC laboratory in Ft.\nCollins, Colorado. The samples were positive for _Francisella\ntularensis_, the bacterium that causes tularemia.\nDisease Agent: _Francisella tularensis_ is a highly infectious, small\ngram-negative coccobacillus. Humans and over 250 types of wild and\ndomestic mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish are\nsusceptible to infection. A variety of ticks and small wild mammals,\nincluding various rodents, rabbits and hares, are the natural\nreservoirs of infection, although the organism may survive for weeks\nor longer at low temperatures in water, moist soil or vegetation such\nas hay, and animal carcasses. _Francisella tularensis_ may be\ndispersed via dry or wet aerosols.\nExposure: Animals and humans are most commonly infected through\nexposure to or ingestion of infected wild animals, their carcasses or\nbody fluids; exposure to or ingestion of contaminated water, soil, or\nvegetation; or bites by infected arthropods, especially ticks and\nbiting flies. Inhalation of aerosolized bacteria is another potential\nroute of infection.\nClinical signs - Dogs: Dogs are thought to be resistant to natural\ninfection. Clinical disease, when it occurs, typically consists of\nfever, anorexia, and listlessness. Additional symptoms may include\nskin or mouth lesions, draining abscesses, enlarged lymph nodes, and\nnasal and ocular discharge.\nClinical signs - Cats: Cats are thought to be more susceptible to\ntularemia than dogs, but still considered fairly resistant to natural\ninfection. Clinical disease, when it occurs, may consist of fever,\nanorexia, listlessness, skin or mouth lesions, draining abscesses, and\nenlarged lymph nodes.\nClinical Signs - Livestock: Livestock, particularly sheep, are\nvariably susceptible to tularemia infection. Large epidemics with\nhigh mortality have been seen in range sheep. Clinical signs are not\nspecific, and usually include fever, anorexia, and depression. Cough,\nrapid respiration, diarrhea, and stiffness and edema of the limbs may\nalso occur.\nPublic Health Considerations: Very few cases of human disease have\nbeen associated with transmission from pets. Transmission from pets\nto humans has been documented from bites and scratches in the case of\ncats and from mechanical transmission by dogs transporting the\norganism on their fur into the household from infected source\nmaterial. Pets may also transport infected ticks into the household.\nTransmission from livestock to humans may involve direct contact with\ninfected animals, animal tissues, or animal products, such as wool,\nand vector transmission via ticks and other biting arthropods found\non livestock.\nDiagnostic Testing: Gram stain of smears or biopsies is rarely\nuseful. Testing of clinical or postmortem specimens for _Francisella\ntularensis_ is available on a limited basis at the CDC Vector Ecology\nand Control Laboratory in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Testing typically\nconsists of blood culture, serology and/or microscopic examination\nand culture of tissue samples (particularly liver and spleen), lymph\nnode aspirates, and exudates. If you plan to pursue diagnosis on a\nlive animal, please collect a blood sample for culture prior to\ninitiating antibiotic therapy. Serology results may be inconclusive\nduring the first 2-4 weeks after infection due to the time it takes\nfor antibody titers to increase to diagnostic levels.\nTreatment: Treatment protocols for tularemia in animals are not well studied.\nHowever _Francisella tularensis_ is usually susceptible to a wide range of\nantibiotics, with the aminoglycosides streptomycin and gentamycin being first\nchoice drugs for human infections. Tetracycline, cephalosporins, and\nfluoroquinolones have also been found to be effective. Relapses may occur,\nusually due to incomplete course of treatment.\nInfection Control: Standard Precautions should be followed.\nEnvironmental surfaces should be decontaminated with soap and water\nand a hospital-grade disinfectant. Primary prevention is directed\ntoward reducing the threat of transmission to animals and humans from\nwildlife and the environment in high-risk areas, because eliminating\ntularemia from its wild animal reservoirs is not feasible.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Currently there is one person hospitalized with suspected tularemia.\nHowever strong the suspicions are, the physician and the Texas\nDepartment of State Health Services are awaiting confirmation before\nmaking a public announcement.\nI would like to acknowledge Dave Taylor, DVM, in Fort Davis, Texas\nfor alerting us to this outbreak.\nWhen I telephoned the Texas Department of State Health Services, the El Paso\nbranch was knowledgeable and prepared for discussions.

When I asked about a\nlarge outbreak in rodents, I was told it was very large, and there was great\nconcern for animals and people. Serology results may be inconclusive\nduring the first 2-4 weeks after infection due to the time it takes\nfor antibody titers to increase to diagnostic levels. If you plan to pursue diagnosis on a\nlive animal, please collect a blood sample for culture prior to\ninitiating antibiotic therapy. \nPublic Health Considerations: Very few cases of human disease have\nbeen associated with transmission from pets.

In 1999, in the\ncounty of Varmland in central Sweden (bordering\nNorway), the 1st outbreak of more than 20 cases\nwas detected in the southern part of the county.\nSince then, there has been an annual average of\n22 cases notified over the previous 7 years (1999 - 2005) (1).\nThis year, 2006, a large outbreak has been\nrecorded, with 90 reported cases in Varmland so\nfar (16 laboratory confirmed cases, others\nreported as having typical clinical\npresentation). The majority of these cases have\nbeen reported from areas near Lake Vanern. It is\nexpected that more cases will be identified if\nthe warmer weather persists. So far in 2006, a\nmuch larger number of tularemia cases have been\nreported in Varmland than elsewhere in Sweden (2).\n19 of the patients live in Hammaro municipality,\nan area that was also considerably affected\nduring the outbreak in 1999. An investigation\ninto the 1999 outbreak detected an apparent\nassociation with Hammaro golf course and the\nimmediate area, and this association has also\nbeen made for several of the 2006 cases so far.\nThe places around the northern shores of Lake\nVanern which are affected by tularemia are also\nwhere a river delta, beaches and golf courses are\nlocated. This fact coincides with the hypothesis\nthat the bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is\ndisseminated via mosquitoes and water-living protozoa.\n_F. tularensis_ is a gram-negative bacterium. The\ndisease spreads from small rodent reservoirs to\nhares and then humans through direct contact,\ninsect bites, or inhalation/ingestion of feces or\nurine. After 3 to 7 days, patients often become\nill with a fever or swollen lymph glands and\noccasionally also characteristic skin lesions.\nSome patients develop general infection with\npneumonia or septicemia. The clinical\nmanifestations are related to the common routes\nof transmission, mostly with swollen lymph glands\nand fever when transmitted by insect bites.\nTularemia occurs throughout North America and in\nmany parts of Europe, the former Soviet Union, China and Japan (3).*\nFamily doctors (general practitioners) in\nVarmland have become proficient in identifying\nthe disease.

Telford, III <Sam.Telford@tufts.edu>\n\nThe editorial comment on Kate Torres' query perpetuates a poorly documented\nassertion about the agent of tularemia, viz., that it may stably persist in\nsoil. I am unaware of any primary literature that documents this for Type A\n(_Francisella tularensis tularensis_).\nIndeed, the North American reports of persistence of _F. tularensis_ in water\nand mud (classic studies by Jellison and others) need to be reexamined,\nbecause it is unclear which subspecies was present. I would bet that it was\nall Type B. There is no question that Type B (_F. tularensis palaearctica_)\npersists in water and mud, and large outbreaks have been recorded in Eurasia\nassociated with arvicoline [living in the fields or countryside - Mod.LL]\nrodent excreta contaminating hay or other environmental materials.\ufffd\nType B is a very different bug from Type A. Type A depends on ticks for its\nenzootic cycle. Type B may have multiple modes of perpetuation, including\nemerging evidence for an association with free-living amebae, which might\nexplain prolonged persistence in wet environments. Naked bacteria of either\ntype seem extremely fastidious and labile in vitro, a fact that stands in\ncontrast to a perception that the agent of tularemia is environmentally\npersistent.\nEnvironmental material may certainly be contaminated by excreta or animal\ncarcasses and serve as fomites, but the duration of infectivity of such\nmaterials is extremely poorly defined except for Type B. The suggestion that\nType A (which is most likely the one detected around DC) is stable in soil (by\nsoil I mean dry earth, as opposed to mud, which has a large aqueous fraction)\nfor any length of time needs to be backed up by finding primary peer-reviewed\npublications, and not by referring to discussion within reviews or reports of\noutbreaks wherein arguments are being made about the most likely mode of\ntransmission. Facts get altered when they are passed from review to review,\nand from recent discussions referencing such reviews. In addition, it is not\ncorrect to equate the physiologic attributes of one _F. tularensis_ subspecies\nwith another.\nAs for urban tularemia, dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) are important\nvectors of Type A. Dog ticks certainly occur in urban areas, as do their main\nreproductive hosts, raccoons and skunks. The potential for zoonoses\ntransmitted by urban dog ticks was underscored by the cluster of Rocky\nMountain spotted fever cases in a Manhattan park (Salgo et al. 1988 NEJM\n318:1345).

There's no need to panic, and the number of\ncases is still low, but officials want people to be aware and take simple\nprecautions such as not handling dead rodents or [other] animals and\nreporting them to the health department.\nTularemia, also called 'rabbit fever,' is caused by naturally occurring\nbacteria. The state averages between 2 and 4 cases a year. From 28 May to 2\nAug 2005, however, 7 cases have been reported in Western Washington --\nincluding 2 in Cowlitz County.\n'We rarely have any cases around here and then, boom, we had several,' said\nHilary Gillette, Cowlitz County's epidemiologist. 'And with other cases\nreported, that got (state officials) interested.' It's unclear whether\nsomething happened to introduce the disease to the area or if it's always\nbeen here and was just undetected, Gillette said. There is some evidence\nthe disease has been here for awhile. An unrelated statewide veterinary\nstudy this winter found that 4.3 per cent of Cowlitz, Clark and Lewis\ncounty pets showed exposure to the disease, compared to the state average\nof 1.9 per cent. 'So maybe it's always been here,' Gillette said.\nThe 2 Cowlitz County cases were found in a man in his 50s and a young boy.\nOfficials believe the man was exposed while using a riding lawn mower.

The report raises the number of confirmed\ntularemia cases to 37 since the summer of 2000 and marks the 6th successive\nsummer that the rare disease has been documented on the Island.\nDr. Frederic Cantor, the public health veterinarian for the state\ndepartment of public health (DPH), said 3 of the 8 cases have been\nconfirmed as pneumonic tularemia, a form of the disease that affects the\nrespiratory tract and is caused by inhaling airborne tularemia bacteria.\nWhile rare in other parts of the nation, pneumonic tularemia has been\ndocumented in increasing numbers on the Vineyard in recent years. Health\nofficials continue to urge people who work outdoors to wear respirators\nrated at N-95 or higher to filter out potentially harmful particles. Dr.\nCantor said none of the 3 victims of pneumonic tularemia appeared to have\nbeen wearing masks when they were infected.\n'Most of these again seem to have exposure to outdoor activities in terms\nof landscaping, caretaking and gardening. I think part of the issue is, are\nall these people not wearing masks and why?' he said. 'That seems to be a\nrisk factor and most of the people seem not to be wearing masks.'\nDr. Cantor said the DPH is examining a possible 4 additional cases of\ntularemia. At least 2 of this year's confirmed cases were other types of\ntularemia, which can be spread by handling infected material, such as\nanimal carcasses or by bites from dog ticks, known to carry the disease. 3\nof the 8 cases are still unclassified, Dr. Cantor said. One has been\nconfirmed as tickborne, and the 1st case of the year, contracted in Apr\n2005 by a Vineyard landscaper, was oropharyngeal, indicating that the\naffected glands were in the man's throat. While the pneumonic form of\ntularemia is the most common type seen on the Island, Dr. Cantor said the\nother cases in 2005 point to the fact that the disease can be spread a\nvariety of ways.\nTularemia has been documented on the Island since the 1930s, when some\nhunters began contracting the disease, also sometimes known as rabbit fever\nbecause rabbits primarily carry the disease. The 1st major outbreak of\npneumonic tularemia occurred in 1978, when 15 people were infected, 7 of\nthem from one home in Chilmark. A Chilmark man died in the summer of 2000\nafter contracting the disease.\nTularemia usually affects about 200 people a year nationwide, putting the\nIsland at the foreground for study in the medical community. Since the 1st\noutbreak in 1978, the high number of tularemia cases has baffled public\nhealth officials and fueled numerous studies. Researchers first traveled to\nthe Island after the 2000 outbreak, including investigators from the\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC), the DPH, and Harvard and Tufts\nuniversities. The teams concluded that landscapers were most at risk, but\nso far they have been unable to conclusively locate areas where the risk\nfor tularemia is the greatest.\n'There is work that's still being done on the Island,' Dr. Cantor said,\n'There may be areas that are likely hot spots but we can't really ascertain\nthat.'\nSam Telford, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Tufts\nUniversity, has been coming to the Island since 2000 once a month during\nthe spring and summer to collect dog ticks and examine the wild animal\npopulation as part of a tularemia study. Mr. Telford told the Gazette in\nJun 2005 that the number of infected dog ticks has remained the same in the\nlast 2 years. Mr. Telford's study shows that Squibnocket and Katama have\nhigher rates of infected ticks than other parts of the Island.\n[Byline: Brien Hefler]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Human infection with _Francisella tularensis_ continues to be a problem on\nMartha's Vineyard, a 100-square-mile island off the southern coast of Cape\nCod, MA. A significant number of the cases are pneumonic, occurring in\nlandscapers and gardeners, related to the aerosolization of infective\nbacteria.\nTelford (mentioned in the posting) and colleagues (1) have investigated the\ngenetic diversity of _F. tularensis_ obtained from Martha's Vineyard\nticks.

They state that prior to 1937, only one case of the\ninfection was recognized, related to contaminated rabbit meat from the\nmidwestern USA. In 1937, however, more than 20 000 cottontail rabbits from\nthe midwestern states of Missouri and Kansas were introduced into the\nmainland state and Martha's Vineyard for sporting purposes (2).

At present, no licensed tularemia vaccine is available in the USA.\nHowever, the LVS vaccine (live vaccine strain) is available to military\npersonnel under an investigational new drug protocol held by the US Army\nMedical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (1).\nThe vaccine is administered via scarification using multiple punctures of a\nbifurcated needle. LVS is derived from strain 15 developed in the former\nUSSR and was obtained by the US military in 1956 (2). It is not well\nstandardized and contains 2 phenotypes of _ Francisella tularensis_, only\none of which seems immunogenic (3).

It was the 1st known\ninstance of researchers in a Boston lab becoming infected with a biological\nagent they were studying, according to a city public health official. And\nit came at an awkward time for BU, as it was seeking local and federal\napproval for a high-security lab to study the most feared infectious\ndiseases in the world.\nHow the workers became infected remains unclear, although BU officials said\nthat researchers had violated procedures intended to protect them from\nexposure. 2 researchers became ill in May 2004, and a 3rd in September\n2004, apparently after separate exposures. But their illnesses were not\nlinked to tularemia until October 2004.\nBU reported the cases to city, state, and federal health authorities in\nNovember 2004, about the time public hearings on the high-security lab were\nbeing held. But neither the university nor the government agencies\ndisclosed the cases to the public at the time, saying there was no risk to\npublic health, because tularemia is not transmitted from person to person.\nBoston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who learned of the cases from BU and city\npublic health officials, also decided against telling city residents.\n'Right from the moment that he was made aware of the situation, the Public\nHealth Commission assured him there was no public threat whatsoever, and\nhe's made it clear that if there was any public threat whatsoever, the\npublic would have been advised immediately,' said Seth Gitell, the mayor's\nspokesman.\nWith Menino's enthusiastic backing, the city Zoning Commission gave its\nfinal approval to the high-security biolaboratory last week [2nd week of\nJanuary 2005]. The lab still must be approved by the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, which is considered likely, because it's\nthe same agency that, in 2003, selected BU as one of 2 sites nationally for\nsophisticated new labs able to study anthrax, plague, and other deadly\npathogens.\nBU and public health officials discussed the cases publicly for the 1st\ntime yesterday, 18 Jan 2005, after media inquiries. The 1st exposures\nhappened last spring [2004], with 2 researchers falling ill in late May\n2004. They complained of flu-like symptoms, and one was hospitalized\novernight. The 3rd infected researcher fell ill in September 2004 and\nrequired hospitalization for several days, Moore said. All 3 recovered\nfully after receiving antimicrobial agents.\nThey worked in a lab that, in 2003, received a 5-year grant from the\nfederal government to develop a vaccine against tularemia, an illness\nspread by insects and animals, including rabbits. Often called 'rabbit\nfever,' it is also viewed as a potential agent of bioterrorism. [Tularemia,\na disease caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, is indeed a\nCategory A bioterrorism disease - Mod. LL]. In 2000, an outbreak of\ntularemia on Martha's Vineyard ignited panic, after a laborer died and\nabout a dozen other people became infected. [Cases still occur on Martha's\nVineyard - Mod.LL].\nThe scientists at BU believed that they were working with a strain of the\ngerm that had been altered specifically for vaccine research so as not to\ncause illness. But a highly infectious strain of tularemia was mixed with\nthe harmless variety. The source of the contamination is being investigated\nby federal health officials.\nThe tularemia linked with the illnesses was supplied by a laboratory in\nNebraska that federal authorities, citing security concerns, declined\nyesterday [18 Jan 2005] to identify.\nBecause the researchers assumed that they were working with a form of\ntularemia not known to cause illness, they did not immediately link their\nsymptoms to their research. It was after the 3rd researcher became ill that\nfaculty members began to suspect that something could be seriously wrong in\nthe laboratory inside the university's Evans Biomedical Research building\non Albany Street in the South End.\nSubsequent DNA tests on the tularemia being studied in the BU lab showed\nthat the bacteria identified as coming from Nebraska contained the harmless\nstrain and a highly infectious type.\n'The deck was stacked against [the researchers], because they were working\nwith something they had no idea they were working with,' Moore said. But\nMoore acknowledged that researchers in the lab had violated policies\nrequiring them to work with tularemia inside an enclosed box, called a\nhood, that sends air through sophisticated filters. Instead, the tularemia\nsamples were sometimes worked with in the open, in part because the\nenclosed research boxes were sometimes filled with material that should not\nhave been kept there, Moore said.\nBlood tests were performed on about 60 university researchers, and those\ntests showed that only the 3 workers who had become ill tested positive for\ntularemia. After the exposure was determined, BU, in November 2004,\nshuttered the lab for decontamination. The part of the lab where the\ntularemia research was conducted remains closed.\nThe investigation into how the exposure happened continues. Samples of _F.\ntularensis_ were sent directly from the Nebraska lab for CDC analysis, and\nthose tests showed no presence of the dangerous strain, deepening the\nmystery around the episode.\n'At this time, it seems to me there's no evidence conclusively to link the\ncontamination to Boston or to Nebraska,' said Jennifer Morcone, a CDC\nspokeswoman. 'Certainly, everyone would like to determine the source of the\ncontamination to make certain nothing like this could happen again.'\nAs a result of the exposures, BU, as well as the Boston Public Health\nCommission, are moving to tighten oversight of research. To improve safety\nin the dozens of public and private research labs in Boston, the Public\nHealth Commission intends by this spring [2005] to start a mandatory\ntraining program for lab workers, emphasizing the reporting of illnesses in\nresearchers. The commission also plans to hire a lab safety inspector who\nwill make unannounced visits to research sites to make certain they are\nfollowing safety protocols, said John Auerbach, Public Health Commission\nexecutive director.\n[Byline: Stephen Smith]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[These accidents underscore the importance of confirming the identities of\nattenuated microbial strains before they are used in the laboratory\nsetting. Since bacterial strains are not easily distinguishable, molecular\nidentification must be used to confirm the identity of strains before they\nare employed in anything less than the highest levels of containment.\nProMED has previously posted a thread regarding laboratory safety and\ndisease dissemination (see below). While it is the case that tularemia does\nnot spread from person-to-person, the infectious dose to infect 50 percent\nof individuals is quite low (less than 100 bacilli), so environmental\ncontamination from a laboratory is of concern. Just as important an issue\nis where and how the attenuated strain became contaminated with virulent\ntularemia bacilli. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n To improve safety\nin the dozens of public and private research labs in Boston, the Public\nHealth Commission intends by this spring [2005] to start a mandatory\ntraining program for lab workers, emphasizing the reporting of illnesses in\nresearchers.

But\nMoore acknowledged that researchers in the lab had violated policies\nrequiring them to work with tularemia inside an enclosed box, called a\nhood, that sends air through sophisticated filters. While it is the case that tularemia does\nnot spread from person-to-person, the infectious dose to infect 50 percent\nof individuals is quite low (less than 100 bacilli), so environmental\ncontamination from a laboratory is of concern. And\nit came at an awkward time for BU, as it was seeking local and federal\napproval for a high-security lab to study the most feared infectious\ndiseases in the world. Instead, the tularemia\nsamples were sometimes worked with in the open, in part because the\nenclosed research boxes were sometimes filled with material that should not\nhave been kept there, Moore said. Samples of _F.\ntularensis_ were sent directly from the Nebraska lab for CDC analysis, and\nthose tests showed no presence of the dangerous strain, deepening the\nmystery around the episode. Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is considered likely, because it's\nthe same agency that, in 2003, selected BU as one of 2 sites nationally for\nsophisticated new labs able to study anthrax, plague, and other deadly\npathogens. [Byline: Stephen Smith]\n--\nProMED-mail\n< 3 Boston University researchers became ill in 2004 after being exposed in a\nlaboratory to a potentially lethal disease called tularemia, university and\npublic health authorities said on Tue 18 Jan 2005. But neither the university nor the government agencies\ndisclosed the cases to the public at the time, saying there was no risk to\npublic health, because tularemia is not transmitted from person to person. It was the 1st known\ninstance of researchers in a Boston lab becoming infected with a biological\nagent they were studying, according to a city public health official. They worked in a lab that, in 2003, received a 5-year grant from the\nfederal government to develop a vaccine against tularemia, an illness\nspread by insects and animals, including rabbits. Subsequent DNA tests on the tularemia being studied in the BU lab showed\nthat the bacteria identified as coming from Nebraska contained the harmless\nstrain and a highly infectious type. Because the researchers assumed that they were working with a form of\ntularemia not known to cause illness, they did not immediately link their\nsymptoms to their research. The tularemia linked with the illnesses was supplied by a laboratory in\nNebraska that federal authorities, citing security concerns, declined\nyesterday How the workers became infected remains unclear, although BU officials said\nthat researchers had violated procedures intended to protect them from\nexposure.

Tularemia has not been associated\npreviously with pet hamsters. CDPHE conducted an investigation to determine\nwhether other owners of hamsters were at risk. Clinicians and public health\nofficials should be aware that pet hamsters are a potential source of\ntularemia.\nDuring Jan 2- Feb 8 2004, the boy was exposed to 6 hamsters that his family\nhad purchased from a pet store in the Denver metropolitan area. Each\nhamster reportedly died from 'wet tail disease' (i.e., diarrhea) within 1\nweek of purchase. One hamster bit the child on the left ring finger shortly\nbefore it died. 7 days later, the child had fever, malaise, painful left\naxillary lymphadenopathy, and skin sloughing at the bite site. After\ntreatment with amoxicillin clavulanate (brand name Augmentin - Mod.LL)\nfailed, the patient underwent excisional biopsy of a left axillary lymph\nnode 49 days after symptom onset for persistent painful lymphadenopathy and\nintermittent fever. Tissue culture yielded a suspected _Francisella\ntularensis_ isolate, which was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain\nreaction and timed-release fluorescence at the CDPHE laboratory.\nConvalescent serology was positive at a titer of 4096, and the isolate was\nidentified by CDC as type B. No other risk factors for tularemia exposure\nwere identified, including no other animal contact, no exposure to game\nmeat, and no known mosquito, tick, or fly bites. The patient improved after\ntreatment with ciprofloxacin.\nWorkers at the pet store reported an unusual number of deaths among\nhamsters but not other animals during Jan-Feb 2004; no carcasses were\navailable for testing. One of 2 cats kept as store pets had a positive\nserologic test for _F. tularensis_ at a titer of 256. Neither cat had\nappeared ill to store employees.\nLists of employees, pet suppliers, and customers who purchased hamsters\nduring Dec 2003-Feb 2004 were obtained from the store owner. 15 of 18\ncustomers were located and interviewed. 8 of these had hamsters that died\nwithin 2 weeks of purchase, but all carcasses had been disposed of and were\nunavailable for testing. One customer and one employee who had febrile\nillness after being bitten by hamsters from the store were negative for _F.\ntularensis_ by serologic testing. The same customer's hamster was\navailable, and it was also negative for _F. tularensis_ by serology and\nculture.\nApproximately 80 percent of the 50 hamsters at the pet store came from\ncustomers who had pets with unanticipated litters. The other 20 percent\nwere purchased from 2 small-pet breeders. These breeders were contacted,\nand neither reported an unusually high number of deaths of hamsters or\nother animals. One breeder also supplied animals to 2 pet stores in\nWyoming. The Wyoming Department of Health had not been notified of any\ntularemia cases linked to these stores.\nConfirmation of a hamster as the infectious source was limited by the delay\nbetween the patient's illness onset and diagnosis and subsequent lack of\navailability of implicated hamsters for testing. Nonetheless, the hamster\nthat bit the patient was the most likely cause of infection because no\nother exposures or risk factors were identified. The positive serologic\ntest for _F. tularensis_ in a pet cat at the store suggested that other\nanimals in the store might have been exposed to _F. tularensis_. In\naddition, the proximity of the onset of the patient's illness to the timing\nof the hamster bite, reports of illness among hamsters, and the deaths of\nhamsters at the pet store indicated an infected hamster as the likely\nsource of illness. A possible scenario, similar to an outbreak of tularemia\nthat involved zoo primates (1), is that infected wild rodents infested the\nstore and spread the infection to hamsters by urinating and defecating\nthrough metal screens covering hamster cages. The infected cat might have\nhad a subclinical or unrecognized illness after catching or eating an\ninfected wild rodent.\nThe store owner was advised to set traps for wild rodents and to inform the\nstate health department of any recurrent animal deaths or reports of ill\ncustomers or staff. No other cases have been identified.\nAlthough tularemia has been associated with hamster hunting in Russia (2),\nit has not been associated previously with pet hamsters in the United\nStates. However, clinicians and public health officials should be aware\nthat pet hamsters might be a potential source of tularemia. Moreover,\nbecause _F. tularensis_ is a potential agent of biologic terrorism (3),\nclinicians should have a heightened awareness of tularemia.\nReported by: J Pape, K Gershman, MD, Colorado Dept of Public Health and\nEnvironment.

Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can\nbe infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are\nimportant in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of\nmechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks,\ndeerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food\nor water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. An exposure such as an animal\nbite will likely result in ulceroglandular or glandular tularemia\n(depending upon whether there is a local lesion associated with lymphadenitis).\nProMED posted on alert (20041008.2760, see below) in Oct 2004 regarding\nhamsters from a Canadian pet distributor that were found to be infected\nwith type B tularemia as well. No human cases were reported.\nTularemia in humans is generally a rural disease, and occurs naturally\nthroughout much of North America and Eurasia. The type B strain (_F.\ntularensis_ biogroup palearctica) is the dominant strain in Eurasia,\nwhereas both biogroups (type A is biogroup tularensis) are found in the\nUSA. Type A is said to be more virulent than type B.\nAlthough not generally transferable from person to person, the infectious\ndose of _F. tularensis_ is quite low, and the organism is listed among the\ncategory A bioterrorism agents. - Mod.LL]\n[The title of one of the references is given incorrectly. It should be:\n'Clinical, epidemiological and therapeutical experience with human\ntularaemia: the role of hamster hunter.' (ref 2)\nThe discussion notes that 'tularemia has been associated with hamster\nhunting in Russia'. It should be noted that the literature also documents\ntularemia associated with hamster hunting in Hungary (Szekelyfoldi, J.\n1970. Tularemia in hamster hunters. Del Med J 42:305-6).

A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n [Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as\nvoles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _F. tularensis_ is found in a\nwide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low\ntemperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal\nmatter. A possible scenario, similar to an outbreak of tularemia\nthat involved zoo primates (1), is that infected wild rodents infested the\nstore and spread the infection to hamsters by urinating and defecating\nthrough metal screens covering hamster cages. Clinicians and public health\nofficials should be aware that pet hamsters are a potential source of\ntularemia.\n Humans become infected through a variety of\nmechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks,\ndeerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food\nor water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type B strain (_F.\ntularensis_ biogroup palearctica) is the dominant strain in Eurasia,\nwhereas both biogroups (type A is biogroup tularensis) are found in the\nUSA. LL)\nfailed, the patient underwent excisional biopsy of a left axillary lymph\nnode 49 days after symptom onset for persistent painful lymphadenopathy and\nintermittent fever. \nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n Although tularemia has been associated with hamster hunting in Russia (2),\nit has not been associated previously with pet hamsters in the United\nStates. The positive serologic\ntest for _F. tularensis_ in a pet cat at the store suggested that other\nanimals in the store might have been exposed to _F. tularensis_. ProMED posted on alert (20041008.2760, see below) in Oct 2004 regarding\nhamsters from a Canadian pet distributor that were found to be infected\nwith type B tularemia as well. Workers at the pet store reported an unusual number of deaths among\nhamsters but not other animals during Jan-Feb 2004; no carcasses were\navailable for testing. In Apr 2004, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\n(CDPHE) was notified about a boy aged 3 years with diagnosed tularemia\nassociated with a hamster bite. Confirmation of a hamster as the infectious source was limited by the delay\nbetween the patient's illness onset and diagnosis and subsequent lack of\navailability of implicated hamsters for testing. One customer and one employee who had febrile\nillness after being bitten by hamsters from the store were negative for _F.\ntularensis_ by serologic testing. Of\nnote, tularemia has also been found in bordering Rumania, where an epidemic\namong hamster hunters was reported in 1955. No other risk factors for tularemia exposure\nwere identified, including no other animal contact, no exposure to game\nmeat, and no known mosquito, tick, or fly bites. The store owner was advised to set traps for wild rodents and to inform the\nstate health department of any recurrent animal deaths or reports of ill\ncustomers or staff. It should be noted that the literature also documents\ntularemia associated with hamster hunting in Hungary (Szekelyfoldi, J.\n1970. TULAREMIA, HUMAN, HAMSTER BITE, 2004 - USA (COLORADO)\n**************************************************\n Moreover,\nbecause _F. tularensis_ is a potential agent of biologic terrorism (3),\nclinicians should have a heightened awareness of tularemia. 8 of these had hamsters that died\nwithin 2 weeks of purchase, but all carcasses had been disposed of and were\nunavailable for testing. These breeders were contacted,\nand neither reported an unusually high number of deaths of hamsters or\nother animals. Nonetheless, the hamster\nthat bit the patient was the most likely cause of infection because no\nother exposures or risk factors were identified. The same customer's hamster was\navailable, and it was also negative for _F. tularensis_ by serology and\nculture. An exposure such as an animal\nbite will likely result in ulceroglandular or glandular tularemia\n Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can\nbe infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are\nimportant in its ecology. In April-May 1934, an outbreak occurred 'in connection with the\nhunting of water rats, hamsters, and hares' (Pollitzer, R., and Fordham\nUniversity New York.

The workers,\nwho recovered, apparently had inhaled that lethal strain.\nAfter 2 months of attempting to unravel the mystery, disease detectives\nhave largely eliminated the possibility that workers at BU, or at the\nNebraska lab that supplied the tularemia to Boston researchers, somehow\nmixed batches of harmless and lethal strains, according to Dr. Paul Mead,\nhead of a federal investigation into the exposure cases. He also said there\nis no indication that there was intentional contamination.\nAuthorities at BU and the CDC have declined to identify the Nebraska\nsupplier, but Dr. Jeffrey Cirillo, an associate professor in the\nveterinarian and biomedical sciences department of the University of\nNebraska in Lincoln, told The Boston Globe on 20 Jan 2005 that the lab at\nhis school shipped the harmless strain to BU in early 2004. Cirillo said\nthe shipment to BU marked the 1st time that Nebraska had sent its\nvaccine-research tularemia to another institution, pointing out that\nextensive federal regulations make such arrangements cumbersome. But he\nsaid Nebraska agreed to supply the bacteria in part because it was not\nwidely available commercially.\nScientists at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln have never worked with\nthe lethal strain of tularemia, Cirillo said. And when the 1st 2 BU\nresearchers fell ill in May 2004, there were no stocks of the dangerous\nvariety of tularemia on the school's South End medical campus, university\nofficials said.\nIt wasn't until August 2004 that BU first took delivery of a vial of Type A\ntularemia, the dangerous form, from a different supplier, and that material\nwas stored in a locked freezer, separate from where the harmless strain was\nkept, said Dr. Thomas J. Moore, acting provost of BU's medical campus.\nOnce tularemia emerged as the leading suspect in the researchers'\nillnesses, a CDC lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, analyzed the material\nin the vial shipped from Nebraska to BU. Those tests showed that both the\nmodified strain and the dangerous strain were present, said Dr. Anita\nBarry, Boston's director of communicable disease control. 'But that didn't\nanswer the question of how did it get into the original bottle,' Barry said.\nKnowing that the Nebraska lab did not work with the dangerous variety,\ninvestigators became increasingly curious about whether animal blood used\nroutinely to grow additional samples might have harbored Type A tularemia.\nBarry said that the Nebraska lab had used rabbit blood from a farm in South\nCarolina to grow the material shipped to Boston, and rabbits are known to\nbe carriers of tularemia, which is commonly known as rabbit fever.\n'To make a batch of rabbit blood, it requires a good number of bunnies,'\nBarry explained. 'One hypothesis is that there was an infected rabbit, and\nwhen Nebraska got the rabbit blood, it would have had Type A tularemia in\nit that nobody knew about.'\nBut by the time a problem was identified in Boston, Barry said, the supply\nof blood that had been used in Nebraska had long since been exhausted,\nmeaning that there was nothing left for testing.\n[Byline: Stephen Smith and Scott Allen]\n--\nGeorge A. Robertson, Ph.D.\nPDA\nBethesda, MD\n<robertson@pda.org>\n[The nonvirulent (or at least attenuated) strain mentioned may be the LVS\nvaccine strain discussed below.\nThe following discussion is taken from 'Developing New Tularemia Vaccines'\nwritten by Mary Beth Nierengarten and myself in Medscape Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.medscape.com/viewpublication/206>\nregarding tularemia vaccines. (The references can be found in the URL).\nAt present, a 'live vaccine strain' (LVS) tularemia vaccine is under\nInvestigational New Drug (IND) status in a protocol at the US Army Medical\nResearch Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick,\nMaryland and is available only for at-risk US military personnel. It is\nadministered by scarification (i.e., use of a bifurcated needle to produce\nmultiple inoculations in the skin, similar to vaccinia inoculation for\nsmallpox).\nThe availability of this vaccine in the USA for use beyond selected at-risk\ngroups has been hampered by several obstacles. According to Colonel David\nL. Danley, Project Manager, Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) at\nFort Detrick, data now required for licensure were not adequately\ndocumented during its development, prohibiting plans to license the current\nvaccine. Because the 'old method of growth using shaker culture does not\nmeet current good manufacturing processes required for FDA licensure,' the\nmanufacturing processes and potency of the current LVS vaccine are being\nre-evaluated, and 'a new process using fermentation technology will be\nused,' explained David T. Dennis, MD, MPH, Chief, Bacterial Zoonoses\nBranch, CDC.\nDespite the increased risk of a bioweapons threat felt after September\n11th, further vaccine development for tularemia remains slow. The projected\ndate of a new licensed vaccine in the USA is not until 2009.\nThe current LVS vaccine is based on research that goes back to the 1960s.\nIt is a descendant of strain 15 developed by the former Soviet Union's\nInstitute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Gamalcia Institute, in Moscow,\nand sold to the US military in 1956 [10]. In the early 1960s, USAMRIID had\nisolated the LVS strain for preventive use in at-risk US military personnel\n[11,12]. Efficacy studies in civilian laboratory employees at Fort Detrick\nrevealed that the vaccine was safe and significantly reduced the incidence\nof typhoidal tularemia from 5.70 to 0.27 cases per 1000 at-risk\nemployee-years [13]. Although the incidence of ulceroglandular tularemia\nwas unchanged by the vaccines, the disease was found to be milder in the\nvaccine cohort. Worldwide, LVS has since been used as seed stock for\ntularemia vaccines [12].\nSeveral limitations of the current LVS tularemia vaccine indicate a need to\nmove forward on developing an improved vaccine. One limitation is the\ncurrent mode of administration, which requires scarification that is both\ncumbersome and difficult to standardize. Further limitations deal with gaps\nin understanding the factors responsible for the virulence and genetic\nstability of _F. tularensis_, as well as which antigens are needed to\nproduce an effective cell-mediated immunity. Current research shows that\nonly one of the 2 phenotypes of LVS, the blue colony type, appears to be\nimmunogenic [11,12].\nA 2nd limitation is confusion over which arm of the immune system should be\ntargeted. Although it has been thought that the humoral immune response is\nnot important in protection against tularemia, a relatively recent report\nfrom the Fort Detrick group has suggested that this may not be the case\n[14]. Pooled sera from humans immunized with LVS were found to fully\nprotect mice against a large lethal challenge of LVS organisms. New lots of\nLVS produced in the USA clearly show immunogenicity in human volunteers,\nproducing both brisk cell-mediated and humoral immune responses [15]. In\nthe future, techniques to optimize the appropriate humoral response may be\navailable.\nNew Generation Tularemia Vaccines\n----------------------------------\nStrategies for development of a new generation of vaccines include\nidentification of individual components of _F. tularensis_, such as the\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) or various other outer surface proteins, as\npotential vaccine components (either native or recombinant). After\nidentification, these components would then be used as immunogens, instead\nof using the entire organism. In laboratory studies, some of these cell\ncomponents have been tested and found to have variable protection in mice.\nFor instance, one of the membrane proteins of the _F. tularensis_ that has\nbeen studied as a potential immunogen is a 17-kilodalton lipoprotein, TUL4.\nThe gene for this antigen has been cloned into a _Salmonella typhimurium_\nmutant [16]. In mice immunized with this recombinant vector, both humoral\nand cell-mediated immune response to the antigen developed, and mice were\nprotected from an LVS challenge.\nThe development of monoclonal antibodies for use as passively protective\nagents is another possible strategy for new vaccine development, according\nto Dr. Dennis of the CDC.\nA number of investigators are conducting basic research into tularemia,\nparticularly molecular and sequencing studies aimed at identifying proteins\nand antigens for use as vaccine candidates. Most of this research is being\nconducted at military research institutions, including USAMRIID.\nAs one would expect, since September 11th, information on manufacturers\nactively working on a new vaccine is scarce. In the USA, DynPort Vaccine\nCompany LLC was awarded a contract to develop, manufacture, test, and\nlicense an LVS vaccine from the current vaccine material, according to both\nDr. Dennis and Col. Danley at Fort Detrick. DynPort has been under contract\nto the USA Department of Defense's (DoD's) JVAP since 1997 and acts as its\nexecutive arm, says Terry Irgens, President of DynPort. Basic researchers\nfrom institutes such as USAMRIID work closely with DynPort, which employs\nover 100 scientists, physicians, and veterinarians to conduct preclinical\nand clinical testing of vaccines. Production and licensure are also managed\nby DynPort, whose contract with JVAP was recently extended to 2012. A\nproposed licensure date is June 2009, as previously mentioned [17].\nInternationally, several efforts are under way to develop new tularemia\nvaccines, but with similar limited information on manufacture and licensure\ndates. In the UK, 2 approaches to a new vaccine, use of defined attenuated\nmutants and a subunit vaccine, are in their earliest stages and are not\nanticipated for licensure in the UK for more than a decade, says Col. Danley.\nOther development efforts are being conducted in Sweden at the National\nDefense Research Establishment, University of Umea, which recently received\na 5-year grant from the US National Institutes of Health to develop a\nsubunit vaccine against aerosolized forms of _F tularensis_. In\ncollaboration with Canadian researchers, under the direction of Dr. Wayne\nConlan, Medical Research Council, Ottawa, Canada, the grant will also\ncompare the efficacy of these candidate vaccines to those of attenuated\nvaccines, said Dr. Anders Sjostedt, who heads the research group at Umea\nUniversity.\nIn Moscow, a project is under way at the Institute of Immunological\nEngineering to develop a chemical tularemia vaccine based on preparations\nof outer-membrane components of _F. tularensis_. This group is also working\non a project to develop a molecular vaccine based on LPS-protein complexes.\n[18] - Mod.LL]", "summary": "New Generation Tularemia Vaccines\n----------------------------------\nStrategies for development of a new generation of vaccines include\nidentification of individual components of _F. tularensis_, such as the\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) or various other outer surface proteins, as\npotential vaccine components (either native or recombinant).

After the 21-year-old woman was\ndiagnosed with pneumonia in mid-August 2004, Health Department officials\nconfirmed she had contracted tularemia, a rare disease caused by the\nbacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which infects both animals and people.\nThe woman reportedly contracted the disease -- also known as rabbit fever\n-- from her dog, after it captured an infected wild rabbit and then licked\nher on the face. The woman survived, and no other cases have since been\nreported.\nTularemia is on the list of potential biological agents that can be used by\nterrorists. As a biological weapon, tularemia-causing bacteria could be\ndispersed through the air and inhaled. Still, health officials say there is\nno reason to believe the incident is linked to terrorism.\n'This woman had [a] clear risk factor for naturally occurring tularemia,'\nsaid Health Department epidemiologist Annie Fine. 'We think it's an\nisolated case, but we're keeping our eyes open.' Despite the optimism, a\nnumber of rabbits collected for data tested positive. However, health\nofficials deny there is any evidence of risk to human beings beyond this case.\nThere are only about 100 cases reported per year in the USA, usually less\nthan 2 percent of which are fatal. Since 1965, there have been 13 other\ncases in the city; the last occurred in 1998.

The persistence of the\nillness on the island has scientists baffled and locals on alert. 'It's\nhigh on everyone's radar screen over there, which is good,' said state\nhealth department veterinarian, Dr. Frederic Cantor.\nThe landscaper, who was sick earlier this summer [2004], and has since\nfully recovered, had the characteristic high fever and cough associated\nwith the illness, but, was never sick enough to be admitted to the\nhospital. He was treated with antimicrobial agents and has had no other\nproblems, Cantor said.\nTularemia can be contracted either through a bite by an infected dog tick,\nby inhaling the highly infectious [organisms] from an infected animal, or,\nthrough contact with the bacteria through an open cut or sore. The version\nof the illness transmitted through a tick bite, or through an open sore,\ncreates a lesion on the skin, and, can also lead to swollen lymph nodes and\nflu-like symptoms. The inhaled version, which is a bioterrorism concern,\ncauses a pneumonia-like condition that is more dangerous than the skin\nversion, Cantor said. Untreated, about 7 percent of victims die.\nIn August 2000, a Chilmark resident died of the pneumonic form of\ntularemia. 10 other cases were successfully treated that summer. In 2001, 3\npeople, including a 4-year-old Newton boy, who was bitten by a tick,\n[apparently on Martha's Vineyard - Mod.LL], came down with the disease,\nand, later recovered. 2 cases were reported in 2002, and last year [2003],\nthere were 4 cases. Prior to 2000, Martha's Vineyard had not had an\noutbreak since 1978, when 12 people were stricken.\nNo cases have been reported on Cape Cod, or Nantucket, in recent years, a\nfact that has mystified some scientists who are now trying to figure out\nwhy Martha's Vineyard is so hospitable to the disease. In 2001, the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta conducted a study in which\n230 island residents were tested for tularemia antibodies, which the body\nproduces in the presence of the disease. Blood samples from 100 of the\nresidents who were not landscapers were taken, and all came back negative.\nBut, when 130 landscapers were tested, 9 percent tested positive for the\nantibodies. None had been diagnosed with the disease, leading researchers\nto believe that they had either fought the illness off without medication,\nor, were being treated with antimicrobial agents for another reason when\nthey contracted it, according to Martha's Vineyard Hospital infectious\ndisease specialist Dr. Dennis Hoak.\nThe research led health officials to surmise that landscapers were\ncontracting the illness when they mowed over carcasses of infected rodents.\nVineyard landscapers now commonly use masks while mowing, Cantor said.\nFor the last 3 summers, Tufts University associate professor of infectious\ndisease, Sam Telford, has spent 3 days each month trapping small rodents to\nsee what kinds of ticks they are carrying, and, whether they are carrying\nany disease. While rabbits are thought to be primary vectors of air-borne\ntularemia, his research does not yet support that theory.\n'Rabbits die within 7 days of getting tularemia. Their population (on the\nisland) has crashed, yet tularemia persists,' he said. The notion that\nlandscapers are kicking up disease [organisms] from dead animals when they\nmow over them is also in dispute, he said.\n'In talking to the landscapers, these guys are outside all the time, and\nthey say 'we walk the properties first. Something as big as a (dead)\nrabbit, we would notice.''\nDog ticks appear to be a critical link in keeping tularemia in an\nenvironment, Telford said.

So far none have\nbeen found. Low levels of the organism were detected by\nlaboratory tests done on filters taken from special air monitors on\nSat, Sun and Mon, 4-6 Oct 2003. However, filters tested from the 2\nfollowing days were negative.\n\n'The new technology in use throughout Houston and Harris County\ngives us information that was not previously knowable.

But\nthe federal government is hoping to change that scenario with its\nnew nationwide program to sniff the air for dangerous pathogens.\nThe 'BioWatch' program is an ambitious effort to sample the air in\nmajor metropolitan areas daily for pathogens that terrorists might\nuse, according to federal officials. Testing equipment is being set\nup in 20 metropolitan areas, according to a Department of Health\nand Human Services (HHS) public relations spokesman in\nWashington, DC. An air monitoring program used during the 2002\nWinter Olympics in Salt Lake City was the prototype for the system.\n\n'The ultimate goal is to deploy these in various cities so that 80\npercent of the American population by geographic distribution will be\nliving in areas that will be covered by this equipment,' the HHS\nspokesman, who asked that his name be withheld, told CIDRAP\nNews. The system involves the installation of special paper filters\non existing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air-quality\nmonitoring stations, the spokesman said. Plans call for removing\neach filter every day, taking it to a laboratory, and using a\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to test it for pathogens\nthat terrorists might use.\n\n'Early detection is the key to getting a jump on a biological\nincident,' said the HHS official. 'They'll be collecting these\nfilters daily, 7 days a week.' He said that from the time a filter\nreaches the lab for analysis, it will take from 3 to 8 hours to rule\nout pathogens or identify one, depending on what it is.\n\nFederal officials say the initial focus of the monitoring includes a\nshort list of agents that terrorists are considered likely to use. The\nHHS spokesman said the laboratories involved, all part of the\nCDC's Laboratory Response Network, can test for a wide variety\nof pathogens, and different labs might look for additional\npathogens. Each urban area will have 10 to 12 air monitoring\nstations, the HHS spokesman said. He said 40 million dollars have\nbeen earmarked for the program for fiscal year 2003, enough\nmoney to deploy the sampling equipment in the 20 cities and cover\nsome additional expenses.\n\nOfficials involved with BioWatch acknowledge that the system's\nexistence prompts tough questions about what to do when\npathogens are found. How will authorities know if a positive finding\nis a true-positive? If it is a true-positive, how can analysts assess\nwhether it represents an isolated natural event or a terrorist attack?\nAnd if the finding does seem to represent an attack, how should\nauthorities respond?\n\nWhile offering few details, the HHS spokesman said authorities in\nthe various cities are working on plans for responding to any\nfindings that indicate a real danger. 'In each of the local\nmetropolitan areas they've set up a working group with the local FBI\noffice and they're working on a game plan on how they're going to\nhandle the analysis that comes out of the system. Each of the\nareas is going to be doing some tabletop exercises to practice how\nthey'll handle it when they get results they need to act on.'\n\nThe public health laboratory director in one of the states affected\nsaid the possibility of false-positives is a big concern. 'When we\napply these kinds of tests, we'd like to be able to culture the\norganisms as well,' to confirm any positive results, he said. But this\nisn't a good option because the air sampling units use high-speed\nairflow that would tend to kill most organisms through shearing\nforces and drying, he said. Spore-forming organisms [such as\nanthrax. - - Mod.JW] would probably survive, but most others would\nnot, he said.\n\nAlso complicating the picture is the natural occurrence in some\nareas of pathogens that terrorists might use. A positive test result\nmight be accurate without being evidence of a real problem. 'A lot of\nfactors would have to be taken into consideration' in interpreting a\nfinding, the laboratory director said.'The last thing you'd want to\nhappen would be to put out a false alarm.'\n\nThe air monitoring program during the 2002 Winter Olympics\n[produced] one episode that gave a preview of the kinds of\nquestions that can arise, according to Scott Williams, MD, deputy\ndirector of the Utah Department of Health. Williams said the\nprogram involved 15 to 20 monitoring stations scattered over a\nlarge area centered on Salt Lake City. The filters were removed\nevery 4 hours and tested for the presence of pathogens in the\nCDC's category A. The lab analysis began with a screen for a\nsingle strand of DNA, he explained. If that test was positive, a\nsecond single-strand test was done; a second positive finding\nprompted a confirmatory test looking for 4 different DNA strands.\nThe lab analysis was handled by the US Department of Energy\n(DOE), which developed the special PCR tests involved.\n\n'There was one event that created sort of an initial posturing of\nresponse,' Williams said. On 12 Feb 2002, a sample collected at\nthe airport came up positive on more than one single-strand test.\n'We alerted the airport that they may need to evacuate,' he said.\nBut officials decided to wait for the confirmatory test before taking\nthat step. That turned out to be the right move, because the\nconfirmatory test showed that the microbe was a cross-reacting\norganism, a nonpathogenic one with a DNA strand that matched a\nstrand in one of the pathogens being sought, Williams said.\n(Officials never were able to identify the organism; it was assumed\nto be 'just an endemic organism that happened to share that single\nstrand,' he noted.)\n\nBefore the alarm was called off, the airport started preparing to\nclose, and hazardous-materials teams were suiting up for possible\nduty, Williams said. 'It was interesting because it created all of the\nscientific and political response processes. . . . It was the most\nrealistic tabletop exercise you could have conducted.'\n\nWilliams said Utah health officials took some lessons from the\nepisode. In the interest of quicker confirmation or rejection of\npositive test results, 'We recommended to DOE that they change\nthe [PCR testing] process so that they always run the 4-strand\nconfirmatory test simultaneously with the 2nd single-strand test.'\n\nThe event also pointed up the importance of tabletop exercises\nsimulating this type of scenario. 'We did a lot of tabletop exercises\nbefore the Olympics, but we never specifically mock-exercised the\nair monitoring event,' Williams said. 'We were able to create a\ngood decision process as we went, but it wasn't as comfortable as it\ncould've been.'\n\nAlso, even with careful planning, potential threat situations\ninevitably involve people who never participate in tabletop\nexercises, he added. 'So we realized that what you need is a very\nrapid briefing process for these people, so they're not trying to\nfigure out what you're talking about while they're trying to make a\ndecision about whether to close the airport.'\n\nHHS and the CDC are the lead agencies on the BioWatch\nprogram because it's a bioterrorism issue, according to the HHS\nspokesman. 'But we couldn't have done it without the DOE's\nassistance with the filters and the testing, and EPA has been key in\ngetting it set up and collecting the filters,' he said.\n\n'It's going to be very labor-intensive,' the laboratory director said\nin describing the effort. 'It'll also be very routine, until you get a\npositive.'\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The principal means of transmission of tularemia is by the bite of a\ntick infected from a wildlife reservoir.

We greatly appreciate the ongoing collaboration and\nsupport we receive from our partners in the local medical\ncommunity and local, state, and federal agencies,' says Herminia\nPalacio, MD, MPH, Executive Director of Harris County Public\nHealth and Environmental Services. \n\nHealth officials said that though the bacteria are found naturally in\nthe environment, precautionary measures are being taken to\ndetermine whether there have been any human cases of tularemia,\ncommonly known as rabbit fever, in the area. In the interest of quicker confirmation or rejection of\npositive test results, 'We recommended to DOE that they change\nthe [PCR testing] process so that they always run the 4-strand\nconfirmatory test simultaneously with the 2nd single-strand test.' \n\nThe air monitoring program during the 2002 Winter Olympics\n[produced] one episode that gave a preview of the kinds of\nquestions that can arise, according to Scott Williams, MD, deputy\ndirector of the Utah Department of Health. That turned out to be the right move, because the\nconfirmatory test showed that the microbe was a cross-reacting\norganism, a nonpathogenic one with a DNA strand that matched a\nstrand in one of the pathogens being sought, Williams said. He said 40 million dollars have\nbeen earmarked for the program for fiscal year 2003, enough\nmoney to deploy the sampling equipment in the 20 cities and cover\nsome additional expenses. \n\nHealth officials say there is nothing to indicate an intentional\nrelease of the organism but that the investigation is continuing to\nsee whether a naturally occurring explanation for the sensor\ndetection can be identified. But this\nisn't a good option because the air sampling units use high-speed\nairflow that would tend to kill most organisms through shearing\nforces and drying, he said.

In each of the local\nmetropolitan areas they've set up a working group with the local FBI\noffice and they're working on a game plan on how they're going to\nhandle the analysis that comes out of the system.

So we realized that what you need is a very\nrapid briefing process for these people, so they're not trying to\nfigure out what you're talking about while they're trying to make a\ndecision about whether to close the airport.'

It is a rare and usually mild disease in humans that can\nbe treated with antibiotics. In rare cases, some forms of tularemia can be\nfatal. The purpose of this advisory notice is to ask people who have\npurchased a hamster in the past 3 months to contact their health care\nprovider if both they and their hamster have experienced illness.\n'We believe the risk to human health is low, but if people have sick\nhamsters and are feeling ill themselves, we want them to advise their\nhealth care provider,' explained Dr David Butler-Jones, the chief public\nhealth officer of Canada.\nIll hamsters, along with other small mammals (chinchillas, guinea pigs,\ngerbils, degues) that were included in shipments with the hamsters, were\nsent to pet stores in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,\nand north western Ontario. At present, there is no indication of illness in\nthe other animals.\nThe British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Alberta Health and\nWellness, Saskatchewan Health, Manitoba Health, the Ontario Minister of\nHealth and Long-term Care, and the Public Health Agency of Canada are\nworking together closely on this investigation.\nTularemia, a bacterial disease, is found naturally in wild animals,\nparticularly rodents. Human tularemia disease is rare and is not known to\nspread from person to person. Tularemia is usually transmitted by contact\nwith infected animals or their cages/immediate environment. This means:\n- being bitten or licked by the animal,\n- handling or cleaning the animal, its toys, cage and feeding equipment,\n- breathing in air contaminated with the bacteria, or\n- eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\nSymptoms of tularemia may include ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen\nglands and painful lymph glands, sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea,\nmuscle aches, dry cough, progressive weakness, joint pain, sore throat and\nswollen and painful eyes. Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after\nexposure to the bacteria but can take as long as 14 days to appear.\nIf your hamster appears sick or dies, and within 14 days you also feel ill,\nsee your health care provider. Be sure to let your health care provider\nknow why you think you may have been in contact with tularemia. Advise your\nhealth care provider to speak with your local or regional public health\noffice.\nPet stores should closely monitor their hamsters and notify their local\nveterinarian if they observe illness and higher than usual mortality.\nWhen handling sick or dead animals or items from their environment (cages,\ntoys, dishes), wear gloves made of rubber, latex, or other waterproof\nmaterial. Commercially available dishwashing gloves that have no tears are\nadequate.\nRemember to wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap or an\nalcohol hand gel after removing your gloves and after every contact with\nthe sick animal or its environment. If your hamster dies, you should\ndouble-bag it and dispose of it in the garbage or bury it deep enough (1\nmetre) that it will not be dug up by other animals.\nThe cage and animal accessories should be washed in hot soapy water using\nany commercially available household disinfectant. Rinse the cage in a 10\nper cent bleach solution (one part household bleach, 9 parts water). Let\nthe cage air dry for at least 10 minutes. A 70 per cent solution of alcohol\ncan then be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action\nof the bleach. Consult your pet store before using the cage for another\nanimal. [Consulting your veterinarian prior to using the cage may be a more\ninformed approach. Pet stores may not be aware of which animals may\ncontract tularemia, if you use the cage for some other type of animal. -\nMod.TG]\nEquipment, including cages and toys, can be disposed of in regular\nhousehold waste. All the items should be cleaned using the procedure\ndescribed above before disposal. When handling litter, if possible, wear a\nmask. Wrap contaminated litter in plastic prior to disposal. Do not attempt\nto disinfect the litter. After handling animals, or after being licked or\nbitten by a household pet, be sure to always wash your hands thoroughly\nwith warm water and soap or an alcohol gel. The same should be done after\nhandling pet toys or cleaning bowls or cages used by animals.

LL] Between 1 Jul and 11 Aug,\n109 cases of tularemia (_Francisella tularensis_ var _holarctica_) were\nnotified to the Swedish Institute of Infectious Diseases\n(Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI) (figure 1). 60 per cent of cases are men and\nmost of the cases have been people of active working age (table 1).\nTypically, most cases are clustered tightly by geography. The locations and\nthe total number of cases vary markedly from year to year (figure 2).\nTable 1. Age and sex distribution of notified tularemia cases in Sweden\nbetween 1 Jul to 8 Aug 2003\nAge (years) / female / male / total\n0-9 / 1 / 9 / 10\n10-19 / 2 / 6 / 8\n20-29 / 3 / 3 / 6\n30-39 / 6 / 8 / 14\n40-49 / 7 / 16 / 23\n50-59 / 13 / 11 / 24\n60-69 / 9 / 10 / 19\n70+ / 3 / 2 / 5\nTotal / 44 / 65 / 109\nThe ulceroglandular form of the disease dominates, with most cases\nreporting a mosquito or tick bite at the site of the ulcer and subsequent\nlymphadenopathy. This is consistent with the presentation during previous\nyears in Sweden (1). This year, a few clusters with respiratory disease\nprobably due to inhalational exposure have also been reported. These cases\nare typically in farmers, with onset of disease within a few days of\nworking with hay. Similar inhalational exposure of farmers has been\nreported in previous outbreaks in Sweden and Finland (2,3). Depending on\nthe route of exposure, tularemia may also present in the oculoglandular and\noropharyngeal forms (4).\nIn addition, _F. tularensis_ has also been diagnosed in postmortem analyses\nof 2 hares from one of the affected counties by the National Veterinary\nInstitute (Statens Veterin\u00e4rmedicinska Anstalt, SVA) (5). Reports of dead\nhares, voles, and other small rodents around the areas with human cases\nhave been included in many case notifications. The reservoir of _F.\ntularensis_ in nature is unknown, although its survival in water and mud\ntogether with the apparent distribution along lakes and rivers in Sweden\nand eastern Europe is suggestive of a water associated reservoir (4).\nMosquito bites, owning a cat, farming, and visiting wooded areas were\nidentified as independent risk factors for tularemia in a recent Swedish\ncase control study (1). In this study, 16 per cent of the cases were\nadmitted to hospital. Tularemia is responsive to antibiotic treatment, if\nbegun within 1 week of onset of disease. With adequate treatment, mortality\ndue to infection with _F. tularensis var holarctica_ is very low. No deaths\ndue to tularemia in Sweden have been reported to SMI during this season.\nThe early start of tularemia notifications together with the rapid increase\nin number of notifications during the first weeks suggest an epidemic year\nin Sweden. Despite the proximity of some of the affected areas to the\nNorwegian border, no cases had been notified in Norway by 11 Aug (6). In\nFinland, dozens of cases have been reported from the areas affected during\nthe 2000 epidemic (7).\nTularemia continues to warrant vigilance during late summer and early\nautumn in the Nordic countries. Early identification of case clusters is\nuseful for correct clinical management of cases. Research is needed to\nidentify the natural reservoir and other environmental factors contributing\nto annual changes in incidence. Natural early warning signals might even\nallow preventive measures in affected geographical areas.\n1. Eliasson H, Lindb\u00e4ck J, Nuorti JP, et al.

The largest recorded outbreak happened in 1966-67 when\nover 2800 people (mainly farmers) got the pneumonic form of tularemia.

Mosquito bites, owning a cat, farming, and visiting wooded areas were\nidentified as independent risk factors for tularemia in a recent Swedish\ncase control study (1). Reports of dead\nhares, voles, and other small rodents around the areas with human cases\nhave been included in many case notifications. In\nFinland, dozens of cases have been reported from the areas affected during\nthe 2000 epidemic (7). The early start of tularemia notifications together with the rapid increase\nin number of notifications during the first weeks suggest an epidemic year\nin Sweden. The ulceroglandular form of the disease dominates, with most cases\nreporting a mosquito or tick bite at the site of the ulcer and subsequent\nlymphadenopathy. These cases\nare typically in farmers, with onset of disease within a few days of\nworking with hay. (Tularemia - Sweden, Finland 19950831.0779), written by one of the authors\nlisted above, included the following: 'Tularemia occurs very seasonally in\nthe Scandinavian countries. In addition, _F. tularensis_ has also been diagnosed in postmortem analyses\nof 2 hares from one of the affected counties by the National Veterinary\nInstitute (Statens Veterin\u00e4rmedicinska Anstalt, SVA) (5). The\nroute of transmission was dust from dead rodents or rodent excrement, which\npeople inhaled when cleaning hay barns in late winter. Variations in numbers of rodents (lemmings,\nhares, etc.) are great between years, as is availability of breeding places\nfor mosquitoes in late spring. \nTularemia continues to warrant vigilance during late summer and early\nautumn in the Nordic countries. Depending on\nthe route of exposure, tularemia may also present in the oculoglandular and\noropharyngeal forms (4).

The disease is generally treatable with\nantibiotics.\nThe illness is caused by a bacterium found in wild animals, particularly\nrodents and rabbits. People can become infected through bites from infected\nanimals or infected insects [such as deer flies and the arthropod tick\n-Mod. LL] , handling carcasses, eating contaminated food or, in rare cases,\ninhaling the bacterium. It is not transmitted person-to-person.\nThe CDC became interested because one of the 3 people appears to have the\nrare, inhaled form of the disease, said Lancaster County health official\nTim Timmons.\nNebraska epidemiologist Tom Safranek said Wednesday he did not know whether\nthe infected men were hospitalized or how they are doing now.\nThe United States averaged 124 cases of tularemia in 1999 and 2000,\naccording the CDC, and 3-4 cases a year are typical in Nebraska.\nTularemia is caused by the organism _Francisella tularensis_, a\nbacteria studied widely during World War II as a biological weapon.\nDepending on how the person is infected, it can cause flu-like symptoms,\nskin ulcers, swollen eyes and a sore throat.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It is vital to remember that the presence of pneumonic tularemia is not\nnecesarily related to the deliberate release of an aerosol of _F.\ntularensis_, one of the category A biowarfare agents. Aerosols of the\norganism occur in a setting such as moving lawns contaminated with the\norganism as is shown in this posting and the 2 outbreaks of pneumonic\ntularemia on Martha's Vineyard which occurred in gardeners and was\nassociated with lawn mowing. It is of note that tularemia is not naturally\nendemic in this area but was introduced by hunting clubs importing rabbits\nduring the 1930s (1). The disease may been found in unusual locations such\nas New York City where a case of fatal pneumonic tularemia occurred in the\nborough of Brooklyn.\nThe mammals that serve as reservoirs are quite limited and include rabbits\nand hares, squirrels, muskrats and beavers. Spread can also be from\ncontaminated water or soil as it is reasonably stable in the environment.\nIt is interesting to note that although the ID50 (number of organisms that\nwill infect 50 percent of those exposed) of the bacillus in the laboratory\nis less than 100 organisms, the lung infection, unlike pneumonic plague\n(another category A disease) does not transmit from\nperson-to-person. Antimicrobials with demonstrable clinical activity\nagainst _F. tularensis_ include the fluorinated quinolones such as\nciprofloxacin as well as streptomycin, gentamicin and\nchloramphenicol. Bioterrorism-associated tularemia may be engineered to\nmanifest resistance to one or more antimicrobials.\nThere is no licensed vaccine directed against tularemia but the so-called\nLVS (live vaccine strain) is covered under an Investigational New Drug\nprotocol carried by the US Department of Defense. This vaccine is not new,\nhowever, as the product was derived from strain 15 which was made available\nto the USA by the USSR, surprisingly, in the midst of the Cold War (2). It\nis administered by scarification via a bifurcated needle, The so-called\ntyphoidal (undifferentiated febrile illness with bacteremia) form of\ntularemia was shown to be diminished from 5.7 to 0.27 cases per 1000\nat-risk person-years (3). New vaccine technologies are being used to\nproduce a better defined vaccine.

According to preliminary\ninformation, she was infected after swimming in the local pond. Town\nauthorities responsible for sanitation and epidemiologic surveillance are\ntaking measures to prevent an epidemic.\n\nAccording to the Emergency Situations Ministry of Ukraine, 1000 people have\nalready been vaccinated against tularemia, and an investigation of this\ncase is underway.

Although\nclassically transmitted to man via infected animals such as rabbits or a\ntick vector, infection with _Francisella tularensis_ may be acquired from\ncontact with soil or water harboring the bacterium.

However,\nthe LVS vaccine (live vaccine strain) is available to military personnel\nunder an investigational new drug protocol held by the US Army Medical\nResearch Institute of Infectious Diseases (4). It is administered via\nscarification using multiple punctures of a bifurcated needle. LVS is\nderived from strain 15 developed in the former USSR and was obtained by the\nUS military in 1956 (5). It is not well standardized and contains 2\nphenotypes of _F. tularensis_, only one of which seems immunogenic\n(6).
