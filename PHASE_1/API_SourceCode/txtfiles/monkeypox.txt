It is usually a self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.\n\nThe patient is believed to have contracted the infection while visiting Nigeria.\n\nThe patient was staying in southwest England prior to transfer to the specialist high-consequence infectious disease centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, where [the patient is] receiving appropriate care.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, PHE experts are working closely with NHS colleagues to implement rapid infection-control procedures, including contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice. This includes contacting passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. If passengers are not contacted, then there is no action they should take.\n\nDr Meera Chand, consultant microbiologist at Public Health England, said: 'Monkeypox does not spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the general public is very low. We are following up with those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary.'\n\nPHE and the NHS have well-established and robust infection-control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease, and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.\n\nThis is not the 1st time that the virus has been detected in the UK. PHE reported the 1st UK cases of monkeypox in September 2018.\n\nBackground\nMonkeypox is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. In most cases, monkeypox is a mild condition that will resolve on its own and has no long-term effects on a person's health. Most people recover within a few weeks [see comment below].\n\nInitial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) continue to occur in Nigeria this year (2019), so it is not surprising if the individual became infected there and traveled to England during the incubation period. The USA CDC states that the incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 7-14 days but can range from 5-21 days, allowing adequate time for travel prior to the appearance of symptoms (see https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html). There is no mention in the above report if the individual acquired the MPX infection from wildlife hosts or from contact with infected people. There is no mention above of the current condition of the patient. The health authorities in England are prudent to track individuals who had been in contact with the patient. Consideration of vaccination of contact individuals with the new MPX/smallpox vaccine, especially those providing care of this patient, in this type of situation may be a useful approach to prevent person-to-person transmission.\n\nPrevention of MPX virus infections in the endemic countries in West and Central Africa will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.

The 1st epidemic peak was observed at the beginning of March 2020 (epi week 10), with 136 cases reported weekly. From [1 Jan through 7 Aug 2020], the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) received 80 samples from suspected cases of monkeypox, of which 39 samples were confirmed positive by polymerase chain reaction. 4 out of the 80 specimens were skin lesions (crusts/vesicles), the remaining samples were blood. There is no further information at this time regarding the outcome of these 80 patients whose samples were tested. Confirmatory testing remains ongoing.\n\nDuring the same period in 2019, 3794 suspected cases and 73 deaths (CFR [case fatality rate] 1.9%) were reported in 120 health zones from 16 provinces while a total of 2850 suspected cases (CFR 2.1%) were reported in 2018.\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of suspected cases of monkeypox and case fatality ratio, by epi week, from 1 Jan 2019 through 13 Sep 2020.\n\nThe provinces reporting the highest number of suspected cases include Sankuru with 973 (21.2%) suspected cases, Mai-Ndombe with 964 (21%) suspected cases, Equateur with 586 (12.8%) suspected cases, Tshuapa with 520 (11.3%) suspected cases, and Mongala with 518 (11.3%) suspected cases (Figure 2). From 1 Jan to 13 Sep [2020], Kwilu province is reporting the highest case fatality ratio of 16.7% (1 death/6 suspected cases), followed by Tshopo 8.1% (17 deaths/211 suspected cases), and Mai-Ndombe 7.8% (75 deaths/964 suspected cases).\n\nActive outbreaks in Mai-Ndombe province (located south of Equateur province, in the north west side of the country) have been reported since January 2020. The outbreak in Inongo health zone (Mai-Ndombe province) is one of the most concerning outbreaks where 1/4 of its territory is affected. This outbreak has been ongoing since June 2020, comprising 65% of the total number of suspected cases with an estimated case fatality ratio of 10%. Moreover, Inongo health zone borders Bikoro health zone (Equateur province); Equateur province is the location of the current Ebola outbreak, and now also a monkeypox outbreak.\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of cases by province from 1 Jan through 13 Sep 2020 (epi weeks 1 to 37 [1 Jan-13 Sep 2020])\nSource: Integrated Disease Surveillance (IDS) Report for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Epidemiological Week 37, 2020\n\nWithin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the majority of suspected cases (58%) are above the age of 5, however, the case fatality ratio for children under the age of 5 is higher at 4.2% (80 deaths/1907 suspected cases) as compared to 3.4% in cases over the age of five (91 deaths/2,687 suspected cases).\n\nMonkeypox cases were reported in health zones which are also experiencing multiple disease outbreaks, including measles, polio due to cVDPV, malaria, cholera, and COVID-19, in addition to an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in Equateur Province which continues to experience armed conflict and violence. The security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains unstable, further disrupting surveillance efforts and response activities. Affected regions for this outbreak continue to experience armed conflict and population displacements.\n\nPotential exposure might be linked to proximity to the forest with many possible animal reservoirs, including for hunting activities.\n\nWith global circulation of the virus causing COVID-19 and ongoing insecurity in the region, there is a risk of disruption of access to health care due to the COVID-19 related burden on the health system. As of 16 Sep 2020, a total of 10 401 cases of COVID-19 including 267 deaths were reported in the DRC.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nWHO is working with national authorities to obtain more information about cases and laboratory capacity. Investigation and confirmation of suspected cases will help to further understand the range of the virus in DRC.\n\nTechnical support is being provided to the Ministry of Health to rapidly develop and implement a comprehensive response plan to strengthen surveillance at national and local levels, including further outbreak investigation and response activities.\n\nOne major challenge to the current emergency includes inadequate funding to respond to the multiple ongoing outbreaks in the country. Weaknesses of surveillance and laboratories, along with a high number of refugees crossing the border from Kasai province into Angola, could all contribute to further spread of the outbreak.\n\nThe support of partners such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) will be critical for the control of this outbreak.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nMonkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that occur sporadically in the rain forests of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family, the same group of viruses as smallpox.\n\nThere are 2 distinct clades of monkeypox virus, the Congo Basin clade and the West African clade. Monkeypox due to the Congo Basin clade virus has seen reported mortality of up to 10% of cases, whereas the West African clade usually displays fatal outcomes in less than 1% of cases. HIV infection appears to increase the risk of death in people infected with monkeypox virus.\n\nThe animal reservoir remains unknown. However, evidence suggests that native African rodents may be potential sources. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14-21 days. Severe cases occur more commonly among children and immunocompromised population, particularly persons with HIV, and are related to the extent of virus exposure, patient health status, and severity of complications. The case fatality ratio has varied between epidemics but has been between 1% and 10% in documented events. There is no specific treatment licensed for monkeypox and a recently approved vaccine is not yet widely available for the public sector.\n\nSince identification of the 1st human case of monkeypox in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then known as Zaire) in a 9-month-old boy, and until the year 1986, 95% of cases worldwide were reported in the DRC. Cases of monkeypox have also been reported from other African countries -- Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Gabon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. In 2003, an outbreak occurred in the United States of America following the importation of infected animals. Single imported cases were identified in Israel and the United Kingdom in 2018, and in Singapore in 2019, all following diagnosis in travelers from Nigeria. In the UK, a secondary case was confirmed in a health worker.\n\nWith the eradication of smallpox and the subsequent cessation of routine smallpox vaccination, human monkeypox has appeared with increasing frequency in unvaccinated populations.\n\nThe risk is assessed as high at national level, moderate at regional level, and low at global level.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nSeveral orthopoxviruses, and specifically the monkeypox virus, circulate in wildlife populations and sporadically spill over to affect human beings. Reducing contacts with and reliance on wildlife will enhance disease prevention efforts for zoonoses that affect wildlife, including monkeypox.\n\nStrengthening cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries (Republic of Congo, DRC, and Central African Republic) including sharing of data and information is needed.\n\nResidents and travelers to endemic areas/countries should avoid contact with sick, dead or live animals that could harbor monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling bushmeat. The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized. Handwashing stations and infection control initiatives such as use of disinfectants should be put in place in hospital settings. Any illness during travel or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history.\n\nTimely contact tracing, surveillance measures, and raising awareness among health care providers are essential to preventing secondary cases and effective management of monkeypox outbreaks. Infection control in health facilities is crucial. Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact, and droplet infection control precautions.\n\nSamples taken from people and animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories. Confirmation of monkeypox depends on the type and quality of the specimen and the type of laboratory test. Thus, specimens should be packaged and shipped in accordance with national and international requirements. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test given its accuracy and sensitivity. For this, optimal diagnostic samples for monkeypox are from skin lesions -- the roof or fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry crusts. PCR blood tests are often inconclusive because of the short duration of viremia relative to the timing of specimen collection after symptoms begin. Serology is not indicated to detect acute infection. For these reasons, blood should not be routinely collected from patients unless part of research or a wider outbreak investigation which includes identifying previous cases.\n\nVaccinia vaccine used during the smallpox eradication program was also protective against monkeypox. Some countries and WHO maintain emergency stockpiles of smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine. A new safer 3rd generation vaccinia vaccine (known as modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine) approved in 2019 for prevention of monkeypox is not yet widely available for the public sector. Antiviral agents are also being developed.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to and trade with Democratic Republic of the Congo based on available information at this point in time.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Monkeypox (MPX) cases continue to grow this year (2020). A previous WHO report indicated that nationally, as of 9 Aug 2020, there were 3567 MPX cases with 132 deaths (see Monkeypox - Africa (06): Congo DR, WHO 20200829.7727068). As noted previously, MPX virus is endemic in the DRC and widespread there geographically. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. but as the WHO report above mentions, contact with infected carrier rodents may the source of MPX virus transmission.\n\nMonkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

Accessed 25 Sep 2019.\n\n[Comment in this report]\nAlthough smallpox has been eradicated from the world, there is a persistent concern that somewhere, somehow, it might escape from the laboratories where it is maintained under lock and key or is kept clandestinely. That would require rapid immunization of an enormous number of people to prevent its spread, with priority given to those providing care to infected individuals. A stock of vaccines for emergency use is essential. Like one's automobile insurance, one hopes never to use it, but it is essential to have when an unlikely accident occurs. The current smallpox vaccine has some limitations for use and carries a risk, albeit small, of serious adverse effects. Having a safe and effective vaccine to replace or supplement the current vaccine would be important.\n\nMonkeypox presents a different kind of public health problem. In Central Africa, it can cause serious disease with a case fatality rate of up to 10%. In West Africa, the virus clade present causes milder disease with few or no fatalities. In either instance, cases are sporadic and often occur in remote areas. Vaccination of people living in these remote areas for a disease that occurs sporadically would be logistically difficult and costly to administer. However, infected individuals in those foci could spread it to some other people with whom they have contact. Also, monkeypox-infected individuals have traveled to other countries, become ill there, and infect caregivers. Having a safe and effective vaccine under those circumstances would help to protect contacts if administered preventively in time for an immune response to occur before exposure to the virus. Because it is difficult to predict where those rare exposure events may occur, should all individuals in contact with patients receive the vaccine? The same question arises with universal vaccination of all caregivers everywhere in case smallpox should reappear.\n\nAssuming that production of the Jynneos nonreplicating smallpox vaccine can be ramped up quickly, it may provide the insurance against the reappearance of smallpox itself. Use of the vaccine in Africa to prevent monkeypox virus infections will depend on the priority given to it by ministries of health in those countries where cases occur and at a cost that can be afforded.\n\nThomas M.

The 38-year-old man tested positive for the rare viral disease, which is primarily transmitted to humans from animals, on Wednesday (8 May [2019]), said the MOH on Thursday [9 May 2019]. It is the 1st case of monkeypox reported here.\n\nHe is currently in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and is in stable condition.\n\nMeanwhile, 22 of 23 individuals who have been identified as close contacts of the patient are also under quarantine as a precautionary measure. One of the close contacts, a workshop participant, had left Singapore on 5 May [2019] before the patient was diagnosed. He has reported to the MOH that he remains well with no symptoms.\n\n'Nonetheless, as a precaution, MOH has informed the public health authority in his home country,' said the ministry. The MOH added that while it is possible for the disease to be transmitted between humans, the risk of spread is low.\n\nThe MOH offers the following precautions to take when travelling to areas affected by monkeypox in central and western Africa:\n- Maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled.\n- Avoid direct contact with skin lesions of infected living or dead persons or animals, as well as objects that may have become contaminated with infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing or linens (e.g., bedding or towels) used by an infected person.\n- Avoid contact with wild animals, and consumption of bush meat.\n- Returning travellers from areas affected by monkeypox should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms (e.g., sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash) within 3 weeks of their return. They should inform their doctor of their recent travel history.\n\nBefore coming to Singapore, the man attended a wedding in Nigeria, where he may have consumed bush meat -- a possible source of transmission of the monkeypox virus. Bush meat, the meat of wild animals hunted and sold for food, is a popular source of protein in some parts of Africa where meat from domesticated animals is scarce or expensive.\n\nUpon his arrival on 28 Apr [2019], he stayed at Hotel 81 Orchid in Geylang. In the following 2 days, he attended a workshop at the Samsung Hub in Church Street, in the Central Business District.\n\nOn 30 Apr [2019], he developed fever, muscle ache, chills and skin rash. Between 1 and 7 May [2019], the man reported that he stayed in his hotel room most of the time. On 7 May [2019], he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance and referred to NCID.\n\nSubsequently, the MOH identified the people who had come into close contact with the man, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop; one worker at the workshop venue; and 4 hotel staff. They have since been assessed by NCID and offered vaccination to prevent the disease or reduce the severity of symptoms, said the ministry.\n\n'As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the patient,' said MOH. Those who develop symptoms will be treated at NCID, and all others who came into contact with the man and have a low risk of being infected are being put under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status, the ministry added. MOH's investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.\n\nCommon symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes and skin rash. In its statement, the MOH said monkeypox is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n'In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and eye infection with ensuing loss of vision,' added the statement. 'There have been reported mortality rates of 1% to 10% during outbreaks, with most deaths occurring in younger age-groups.'\n\nTransmission of monkeypox mainly occurs when a person comes into close contact with infected animals, usually rodents, through the hunting and consumption of bush meat. It added that transmission of the disease between humans is possible but limited, as a person is infectious only when he has symptoms, particularly skin rash.\n\n'Transmission typically occurs from close contact with the respiratory tract secretions or skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by an infected person's fluids or lesion materials,' it added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is not the 1st time that a human monkeypox (MPX) virus infection has been imported into another country from Nigeria. In 2018, 2 cases of MPX virus infection were imported into the UK with an additional case ensuing from local transmission from the 2nd patient. The 1st monkeypox case involved a male Nigerian naval officer who was attending a training course at a naval base in Cornwall in southwestern England. The 2nd patient was a UK man who returned to the country from a 22-day vacation in Nigeria on 4 Sep 2018. A 3rd imported case was an Israeli who lived and worked in the Port Harcourt area of Rivers state in southern Nigeria (an endemic MPX region). The man got sick about a week after his return to Israel from Nigeria.\n\nMPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and has been actively transmitted this year (2019). Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017, 311 suspected cases and 7 deaths have been reported in 26 states in Nigeria. MPX virus transmission is currently occurring over a broad geographic area in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area since 2017 and again this year (2019). The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear. Perhaps there has been an epizootic of MPX virus infections among its rodent hosts, with spillover to people.\n\nMonkeypox is an orthopoxvirus infection and is related to smallpox.

From a makeshift base in Zomea Kaka village, they trek 30 kilometres (18 miles) across muddy tracks to Bagandou, where a dozen children appear to have developed rashes characteristic of the virus, which in rare cases can be fatal.\n\nMonkeypox virus, 1st identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970, has symptoms similar to human smallpox, if less severe. In May [2018], the virus became a 'public health threat,' according to local CAR authorities. It was the latest outbreak detected in CAR since 2013, according to World Health Organisation advisor Augustin Diebert.\n\nMedecins sans Frontieres (MSF) dispatched an emergency team to set up in Zomea Kaka after 3 cases of the virus were identified. Already they have quarantined 9 people, most of them children. 'Monkeypox may be endemic to this area,' Karume said, pulling off muddied boots after another trek out of their MSF base.\n\nBefore entering the 'red zone' quarantine area cordoned off with a fence, everyone dons the required gear -- rubber boots, disposable overalls, masks and goggles. Nearby, a few metres away, their patients sit on benches eating breakfast. Some show traces of the virus on their faces. For some, crusts have discoloured parts of their skin. Peeling is a sign of healing.\n\n'It's a self-limiting virus; we just treat the symptoms and administer antibiotics and prevent infections,' Karume said. 'We used to think it was transmitted by monkeys, but it is more by rodents. Secondary transmission is through an infected person. If nothing is done it can lead to complications,' he said, adding that one patient lost an eye because of edema.\n\nIt not only helps halt the spread, but allows him to understand this little-studied disease. 'This here is my champion, my miracle worker,' Karume said, smiling under his mask in front of a young Bagandou boy who has developed no symptoms unlike the rest of his family. 'If he tests positive for monkeypox, it means he has some sort of immunity,' he said. A blood sample is to be sent to the capital for testing.\n\nNot far from the health centre, the team's joint coordinator prepares everything for the day's return expedition to Bagandou to take samples from a dozen suspected cases detected the day before. The driver of the 4x4 vehicle steers onto what passes as a track winding through the vegetation.\n\nWhen the team arrives in a village, some worried residents often think the MSF vehicles are there to respond to Ebola, the disease that ravaged parts of West Africa. Informing communities beforehand is key to allaying fears.\n\nArriving in Bagandou, adults welcome the MSF team. Only a few children move away, frightened by the memory of the sting of the last vaccination campaign conducted by the NGO in this area.\n\nBut back in the CAR capital Bangui, Bagandou's blood samples turn out to be negative. It seems the virus is not ready to reveal its secrets yet to Karume.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) are not new to the Central African Republic (CAR). Since 2013, CAR has been experiencing at least one MPX outbreak every year, especially in its eastern region. Since the beginning of 2018, outbreaks have been reported in 3 health districts, namely, Bambari in the centre, Bangassou in the eastern part of the country, Mbaiki in the southwest, and now Bagandoun in the south. The case fatality rate continues to be very low.\n\nPrevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria, Cameroon, Liberia and more recently in CAR. One wonders whether there is an MPX virus epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in CAR and the other affected countries. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.

The patient is an Israeli who lives and works in the Port Harcourt area [Rivers state] of southern Nigeria (an endemic region). The man got sick about a week after his return from Nigeria and was diagnosed today [12 Oct 2018] according to his clinic and after laboratory approval. The patient's condition is good and improving; he is currently in isolation at his home.\n\nMonkeypox belongs to a group of smallpox diseases that can occur in different species and resembles chickenpox in essence but with different wounds. It is a viral disease characterized by fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue, with a typical rash up to 3 days later. The disease usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks and passes by itself without treatment. The disease is transmitted between animals and is generally not contagious from one person to another. The Ministry of Health takes the necessary actions to monitor and treat the disease.\n\nIn the fall of 2017, Nigeria saw their 1st confirmed monkeypox outbreak in nearly 40 years, resulting in more than 200 confirmed and suspected cases. Although that outbreak was reportedly quelled in February [2018], a small number of isolated cases have continued to be reported over the past 6 months. Fortunately, the West African monkeypox virus is less virulent and less easily transmitted than its Central African counterpart.\n\nAlthough Nigeria continues to report only low levels of infection (see Nigeria CDC Monkeypox Update Epi Week 37: https://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/6c3cf1e472c509190602a5d431c0af1e.pdf), 3 cases exported from Nigeria in just over a month suggests the virus may be more active than believed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[[ProMED-mail thanks Nati Elkin <Nati@poultrymed.com> for the Israeli Ministry of Health report of this case in Hebrew available at https://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/12102018_1.aspx. - Mod.ML]\n\nThis is the 3rd monkeypox infection contracted in Nigeria with the affected individuals having come down with the disease in other countries: 2 in the UK and now one in Israel.

One was a Nigerian resident in Cornwall, followed by the case at the Blackpool Victoria hospital.\n\n'This health care worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made,' said Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director of National Infection Service at PHE.\n\n'We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly. It is therefore not wholly unexpected that a case has been identified.'\n\nThe latest patient has been isolated to reduce risk of transmission to others, receiving treatment at a specialist unit at the Royal Infirmary in Newcastle in the UK, according to PHE, who said they are following up with close contacts of the health care worker and tracing anyone who had contact with them 24 hours before they 1st noticed a rash.\n\n'This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced,' said Phin.\n\n'The fact that only one of the 50 contacts of the initial monkeypox-infected patient has been infected shows how poorly infectious the virus is,' commented Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham. 'It is wrong to think that we are on the brink of a nationwide outbreak.'\n\nMonkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to human smallpox, that typically occurs in remote parts of central and West Africa, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is mostly transmitted to humans from infected wild animals, such as rodents or monkeys, but can spread from person to person.\n\nSymptoms include fever, muscle aches and rash. People usually recover within a few weeks, though it can lead to serious illness in some cases.

The health care worker, reportedly from Fleetwood, is understood to have visited her doctor at Mountview Practice in Dock Street in the port town before being moved to the north east and quarantined.\n\nShe was the 3rd person to be diagnosed with the tropical disease in the UK, after treating the 2nd, who had recently visited Nigeria, at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. The 1st was a Nigerian resident staying at a naval base in Cornwall in an unconnected case, meaning the medic is thought to be the 1st to have actually caught monkeypox here.\n\nOne woman who attended an appointment at Mountview last Monday said she was contacted by Public Health England, with her and her young child later having a smallpox jab at the Victoria Hospital, where all staff have also been offered the vaccine in the hope it will lessen the impact of any further diagnoses. 'We are adopting a highly precautionary approach to minimise the risk of additional cases and are tracing anyone who had contact with this individual during the 24 hours before they noticed a rash,' Public Health England said in a statement last week. The government body yesterday [1 Oct 2018] refused to answer several questions or comment further.\n\nMonkeypox is said to be caused by a virus and has initial symptoms of fever, headache, sore muscles, chills, and exhaustion. A rash then follows, usually developing 1st on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, while blisters and scabs also develop.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) described monkeypox as a 'rare viral zoonotic disease' -- a virus given to humans by animals -- mostly found in 'remote parks of central and west Africa, near tropical rainforests'. It is similar to smallpox, a deadly disease eradicated in 1980, and, though much milder, it can also be fatal. Between one and 10 out of every 100 victims die, WHO said, 'with most deaths occurring in younger age groups.' None of the UK cases have been so serious. The United Nations agency added: 'There is no specific treatment or vaccine available, although prior smallpox vaccination was highly effective in preventing monkeypox as well.'\n\nWhen the 1st 2 cases were announced, a hospital spokesman said there was 'no further risk to other staff, patients, or visitors', though they did say the medics who treated the infected patients were being watched for signs of illness. Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service, said it was 'very unusual to see 2 cases in this short a period of time,' but later said: 'We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so they can be assessed quickly. 'It is, therefore, not wholly unexpected a case has been identified.'\n\nAll 3 people were undergoing treatment in isolation in different regions, the Vic patient at the Royal Liverpool University hospital, the medic at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, and the naval base resident at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Last week, Public Health England said those who had not been contacted 'did not need to be concerned', but conceded that a 'significant' number of patients at the Blackpool Victoria Hospital may have been exposed to monkeypox. A spokeswoman did not provide even a rough figure, however.\n\nMarie Thompson, the director of nursing at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Vic, said staff were 'working within the guidance of Public Health England.' She added: 'The staff member was picked up early and is getting quick treatment. We know monkeypox is a very rare disease. It is new to this country. This is a virus along the lines of having chickenpox. Symptoms are flu-like. You get a rash, but people recover within a few weeks.'\n\nAn unnamed friend of the medic, who was quoted in a national newspaper, said: 'She's in a lot of pain and has scabs on her face, up her nose, and over her body. She and her family are worried and distressed.'\n\nDr Jeremy Farrar, director at biomedical research charity Wellcome, said: 'That this 3rd case of monkeypox has been diagnosed now in a healthcare worker in the UK is worrying and an important reminder of the threat posed by infectious diseases in our connected world. Whilst cases of monkey pox are, thankfully, rare, it is an example of one of a number of diseases for which there is no approved vaccine or treatment. With proper infection control in place, the disease can be controlled and is usually self-limiting and currently poses a very low threat to the wider population. International borders present very little barrier for disease, and we must work together and support scientists and researchers wherever they are in the world to develop vaccines and treatments for the patients who need them the most in order to protect us all.'\n\nProfessor Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular biology at the University of Nottingham, added: 'The fact that only one of the 50 contacts of the initial monkeypox-infected patient has been infected shows how poorly infectious the virus is. It is wrong to think that we are on the brink of a nationwide outbreak. There are 2 main strains of virus: West African and Central African. Given that the 1st infected patient had travelled from Nigeria, it would be a reasonable guess that we are dealing with a West African strain, but this needs to be confirmed. The West African virus is associated with milder disease, fewer deaths, and limited human-to-human transmission. Patients usually clear the infection with relative ease within a few weeks,' he said.\n\nMonkeypox outbreaks have occurred since it was 1st diagnosed in 1970. A 9 year old boy became the 1st human to be diagnosed with monkeypox in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1970. Since then, most cases have been in rural, rainforest regions of the Congo basin and western Africa, WHO said, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is endemic.\n\nMonkeypox left Africa in early 2003, when cases were confirmed in the United States. 'Most of the patients were reported to have had close contact with pet prairie dogs that were infected by African rodents that had been imported into the country [from Africa],' WHO added. Since 1970, cases have occurred in 10 African countries, and, last year [2017], Nigeria experienced its largest documented outbreak.\n\nIn Africa, human infections usually come from handling infected monkeys, giant rats, and squirrels, with rodents the most likely carrier. Eating poorly cooked meat of infected animals also carries a risk, said WHO. Human-to-human transmission comes from close contact with an infected patient or objects recently contaminated by them. 'There is no evidence, to date, that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox infections in the human population,' WHO added.\n\nA recent study of the prairie dog-to-human model found 2 strains of the virus: Congo basin and West African, with the former more virulent. The incubation period -- the time from infection until symptoms become apparent -- ranges from 5-21 days. The infection is split into 2 periods: The invasion period, which lasts around 5 days from infection and results in flu-type symptoms, and the skin eruption period, where various stages of rash break out, with small, fluid-filled blisters following. This lasts up to 3 weeks. The number of lesions can vary greatly, from a few to several thousand. Around a 3rd develop on the genitals.\n\nThere are no specific treatments or vaccines, though smallpox vaccinations are 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox and 'will likely result in a milder disease course,' WHO said. During outbreaks amongst humans, close contact with other patients is the 'most significant risk factor,' and 'the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. Surveillance measures and the rapid identification of new cases are critical for outbreak containment. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox virus infection, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions.'\n\nA hospital spokesman said: 'The safety and well-being of all our patients and staff are vitally important to us, and we ensure our staff have the training and equipment they need to do their jobs effectively. We have been speaking to staff to provide any further advice or reassurance where necessary.'\n\n[byline: Wes Holmes]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above report provides additional details about the 3 cases and an overview of monkeypox and its clinical features.

Between September 2017 when the outbreak started and 31 Aug 2018, a total of 262 suspected cases had been reported from 26 states. Of these, 113 have been confirmed in 16 states with 7 deaths. The highest number of cases have been reported from states in the South-South region of Nigeria.\n\nFollowing the recent report of the 2 cases in the UK, NCDC has been working with the UK's public health agency; Public Health England (PHE), the public health departments in the affected states and other partners in Nigeria to investigate these cases. The NCDC has also been working closely with states across the country to strengthen surveillance, detection and response to cases of monkeypox. A Technical Working Group coordinated by NCDC and comprising of partners from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control (US CDC), and other agencies, meet weekly to ensure coordination. In addition, NCDC met with stakeholders recently, including surveillance officers and case management physicians from all affected states to review the actions taken so far and strategise on how to strengthen the country's response.\n\nMonkeypox is a virus that is spread primarily from animals to humans, with symptoms such as fever, headache, body pain, malaise, lymphadenopathy (enlargement of glands), sore throat and the typical generalized vesicular rash. This may last for 2-4 weeks. Transmission is via direct contact with infected animals, human, or contaminated materials. The virus does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low.\n\nMonkeypox is generally self-limiting, which means patients tend to recover in a couple of weeks. However, supportive care and management of the condition is required and mostly successful. Control measures include isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, strict adherence to universal precautions, especially frequent handwashing with soap and water and the use of personal protective equipment.\n\nWe reassure Nigerians that NCDC has the capacity to effectively diagnose and respond to cases of monkeypox. The National Reference Laboratory in Abuja has the capacity to test for cases of monkeypox with a quick turn-around time. We therefore encourage any healthcare worker that suspects a case of monkeypox, to reach out to their State Epidemiology team for appropriate action.

The patient had contact with a person who had a 'monkeypox-like rash,' and he also ate bush meat while visiting Nigeria. Nigeria has had 262 suspected and 113 confirmed monkeypox cases since September 2017.\n\nThe officials also provide more details on the 1st case, which PHE first reported on 8 Sep [2018]. The cases appear unrelated, PHE has said.\n\nMonkeypox is an orthopoxvirus infection and is related to smallpox. The disease can also be confused with chickenpox, which is caused by an unrelated virus.\n\nThe 1st monkeypox case involves a male Nigerian naval officer who was attending a training course at a naval base in Cornwall in southwestern England. PHE was notified of his case on [7 Sep 2018].\n\nThe officer arrived in London from Abuja, Nigeria, on [2 Sep 2018], then took a train to the Cornwall base the same day. The next day, however, he sought primary care on the naval base after he spiked a fever and had swollen lymph nodes and a rash near his groin. Because the rash was suspected to be caused by a _Staphylococcus_ infection, the man was prescribed antibiotics.\n\nBy [6 Sep 2018], though, the rash had spread to the man's torso, face and arms, and, after clinicians re-examined him they placed him in isolation in his quarters. Multiple samples, including swabs of the lesions, were sent to the PHE Rare and Imported Pathogen Laboratory (RIPL), whose scientists confirmed monkeypox by sequencing analysis.\n\nThe man is now in stable condition and is improving, according to the report.\n\nMultiple exposures in 2nd case\n------------------------------\nThe 2nd patient is a UK man of unknown age who returned to the country from a 22-day vacation in Nigeria on [4 Sep 2018] via a flight from Paris. He sought care at the Accident and Emergency Department at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals on the northwest coast on [6 Sep 2018] for fever, swollen lymph nodes, a scrotal lump, and an itchy maculopapular rash, which is a flat, typically red area covered with small, connected bumps.\n\nThe man said the rash first appeared in Nigeria before his trip back to England and affected his face before spreading to other areas, including the palms of his hands, and had become pustular. He has also had a different febrile illness a week before coming to the Blackpool hospital and had received antibiotics for that, the authors of the report said.\n\nOn examination at the hospital, the man had 'crops of vesicles that were progressing and lesions on the mucosal surfaces of the mouth,' the report said. He was isolated at the hospital, and the RIPL confirmed monkeypox DNA by multiple molecular tests.\n\n'Although the patient was isolated,' the report said, 'monkeypox was not initially suspected because the 1st lesions appeared in the groin, and the wearing of full personal protective equipment (a filtering face-piece with three indicating levels of protection [FFP3], eye protection, gloves, and sterile disposable gown) was not implemented immediately.'\n\nA 'number' of HCWs were potentially exposed because of the PPE lapse, the authors wrote. The man was transferred to a specialized unit at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital on 10 Sep [2018] and remains in stable condition.\n\nAlthough the ultimate source of the man's infection is unknown, he reported contact with a person who had a monkeypox-like rash at a large family gathering and ate bush meat during a visit to a rural area in southern Nigeria.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n'Although there was no evidence for an epidemiological link between the 2 cases in the UK, both had travelled in southern Nigeria before coming to the UK,' the investigators said. 'While it was difficult to obtain clear travel histories from the patients, both cases had visited areas in southern Nigeria (Lagos State, Federal Capital Territory, Rivers State, and Delta State), where cases of monkeypox have recently been reported.'\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is conducting epidemiologic investigations to identify contacts of the 2 cases and to determine the source of infection, the authors noted.\n\nIn the UK, PHE is following up on 229 of 243 contacts; 93 of them are under active surveillance, while 136 are under passive surveillance. Officials are also seeking out the other 14 as-yet-unreached contacts.\n\nThe report does not specify how many HCWs might have been exposed in the 2nd case, but it says that 27 HCWs at the referral hospitals for both patients (Royal Free and Royal Liverpool) were offered the smallpox vaccine before being exposed to the patients.\n\nIn France, officials have contacted passengers who took the same flight from Lagos to Paris with the 2nd case-patient.\n\nThe officials conclude the report, 'The diagnosis of 2 unconnected monkeypox cases within a short time frame in the UK is a highly unusual occurrence and most probably reflects the ongoing monkeypox transmission events in a number of African countries, including Nigeria.\n\n'This incident reinforces the importance of infectious disease surveillance, clinical awareness, and early recognition and isolation, as well as the need to obtain a full travel history for all patients. This incident also highlights the importance of global health security initiatives and the rapid sharing of information.'\n\n[Byline: Jim Wappes]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The report above, drawn from the Eurosurveillance published article, provides some information about where in Nigeria these 2 cases might have acquired their infections. Several possibilities are mentioned. Nigeria has had many monkeypox cases in 2017-2018 in several states. The most recent cases were in June 2018, in Plateau state. These cases in Nigeria were caused by the West African clade of the monkeypox virus, presumably the same clade of the virus as infected the 2 UK cases. Previous monkeypox outbreaks indicate that monkeypox virus is not readily transmitted directly from person-to-person. However, contact tracing and surveillance and use of PPE by healthcare personnel are prudent.\n\nNon-human primates are not a monkeypox virus reservoir. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent, and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).

Since the beginning of 2018, outbreaks have been reported in 3 health districts, namely Bambari in the centre, Bangassou in the eastern part of the country, and more recently Mbaiki in the southwest.\n\nIn Bambari district, the outbreak was declared on 17 Mar 2018 in the Ippy sub-district after the index case developed symptoms on 2 Mar 2018. From week 9 (week ending 4 Mar 2018) to week 11 (week ending 18 Mar 2018), a total of 9 suspected cases with no deaths were reported from Ippy sub-district. Of the 7 samples tested, 6 were laboratory confirmed for monkeypox by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at Institut Pasteur de Bangui.\n\nOn 5 Apr 2018, the Ministry of Health was informed of a suspected case in Bangassou District, close to Bambari District where the index case was reported. The index case is a merchant who developed symptoms on 29 Mar 2018 in Dembia village, sub-district Rafai, who was hospitalized in Bangassou district hospital. From 5 Apr 2018 to week 20 (week ending 20 May 2018), 15 suspected cases including one death (case fatality ratio 6.7 percent) were reported in Bangassou; 3 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR from the 11 samples tested. The death was of a 33-year-old woman who died in a health facility 3 days after she developed a rash. Since 16 May 2018, no cases have been reported from Bambari and Bangassou districts.\n\nGeographical distribution of cholera cases in Central African Republic, 4 Mar - 30 Jun 2018\n\nIn week 26 (week ending 1 Jul 2018), a 27-year-old female developed symptoms in Bangandou sub-district, Mbaiki district, and test results released on 30 Jun 2018 were positive for orthopoxvirus by RT-PCR. No epidemiological link has been established with cases from Bambari and Bangassou. Since 30 Jun 2018, a total of 5 suspected cases with no deaths have been reported from Bangandou. Among the 5 cases, 2 tested positive for monkeypox (RT-PCR).\n\nCumulatively, 29 cases of monkeypox with one death (case fatality ratio 3.4 percent) have been reported since 2 Mar 2018 in the Central African Republic, and 11 cases have been laboratory confirmed out of 23 samples tested. Among the confirmed cases, 63 percent (n=7) are female, and 45 percent (5) are aged between 20 and 30 years; 2 confirmed cases are age 5 and below.\n\nPublic Health Actions\n- Active surveillance has been strengthened in the country, especially in Mbaiki health district, including case investigation of suspected cases and contact tracing.\n- Capacity for case management and infection prevention and control measures have been enhanced at health facility level.\n- Awareness campaigns have been conducted in the villages where the cases originated.\n- Free healthcare has been provided to monkeypox patients in health facilities across the country.\n\nDespite the poor security situation across the country delaying case investigation in Bambari and Bangassou, all cases have been investigated in these areas, with 75 percent tested for monkeypox and contacts being followed-up. This shows the extent of the efforts made by the national health authorities and partners to control the outbreak. However, the recurrence of monkeypox outbreaks in the country since 2013 and the emergence of a new cluster of cases in Bangandou, Mbaiki district in June 2018, where cases have been notified almost every year since 2013, underscore the need to continue raising awareness of the disease among the local population and strengthen preparedness measures at the national level. Inclusion of the animal health division in the response activities is also key in the containment of the outbreak, given the close contact of the affected populations with wildlife.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases continue to occur in the Central African Republic. The case fatality rate continues to be very low. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria, Cameroon, Liberia and more recently in the Central African Republic (CAR). One wonders whether there is an MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in the CAR and the other affected countries. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nCentral African Republic: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/66]", "summary": "From 5 Apr 2018 to week 20 (week ending 20 May 2018), 15 suspected cases including one death (case fatality ratio 6.7 percent) were reported in Bangassou; 3 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR from the 11 samples tested.

Dr Kunden Deyin, the state commissioner for health, told the News Agency of Nigeria on [Thu 7 Jun 2018] in Jos that the 1st case recorded was imported from Port-Harcourt, as the victim came in from Rivers for treatment.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, the infected victim eventually infected his brother and both of them were treated at the Bingham University Teaching Hospital in Jos and discharged. Deyin said that the state's Epidemiology and Surveillance unit of the ministry are still monitoring the contacts to curtail the spread of the disease.\n\nThe commissioner said that the symptoms of monkeypox were similar to that of chickenpox but more severe. He said that the disease is primarily transmitted from animal to man while the secondary source of transmission is through human to human contact. Deyin warned that people who kill, touch or cook bush animals, such as rats, squirrels and monkeys were at risk of contracting the disease as they serve as reservoirs of the virus. He cautioned the public to desist from indulging in such acts. Deyin also called on the public to report any sign of unexplained rashes to the nearest health facility.\n\nHe further disclosed that the number of suspected cases has risen from the initial 87 suspected cases on [Tue 5 Jun 2018] to 126 suspected cases. However, he assured that the ministry is working in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF; Doctors Without Borders) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to contain the disease.\n\nThe commissioner further cautioned the public to ensure that they practise handwashing and maintaining good hygiene as measures of preventing the disease. Besides, Deyin further cautioned that people should desist from eating uncooked vegetables, raw fish, street foods and ensure that they drink boiled water. He also called on the public to report cases of diarrhoea and vomiting to the nearest health facility.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria recalls that the state had recorded 5 confirmed cases, 3 deaths from symptoms similar to cholera and 87 cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A 25 Feb 2018 report that summarized monkeypox cases as of that time indicated that there was a total of 228 suspected cases reported from 24 states and the federal capital territory [FCT]; 89 cases had been confirmed in 15 states, a total of 6 deaths had been recorded since the outbreak, 4 of which are in patients with background immunosuppression. A clustering of cases was found in Bayelsa, Rivers and Imo states but no evidence of epidemiological linkages across states had been demonstrated. Genetic sequencing suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into the human population.\n\nThe most recent extensive monkeypox (MPX) outbreak is the one in Nigeria, where as of late February 2018 there have been 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases in 14 states from September to December 2017. In addition, a 26 Mar 2018 report indicated that there were 2 suspected MPCX cases in Adamawa state with a cumulative case count of 6 with 1 death (https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/adamawa-state-integrated-disease-surveillance-and-response-idsr-nigeria-emergency-7). Now there are 2 additional cases, this time in Plateau state.\n\nThe question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria and more recently in the Central African Republic. In Nigeria, infection of the index case for this outbreak was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing suggesting multiple sources of introduction of MPX virus into the human population, one wonders whether there is an MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in Nigeria. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A 25 Feb 2018 report that summarized monkeypox cases as of that time indicated that there was a total of 228 suspected cases reported from 24 states and the federal capital territory [FCT]; 89 cases had been confirmed in 15 states, a total of 6 deaths had been recorded since the outbreak, 4 of which are in patients with background immunosuppression.

At least 16 people in Cameroon are thought to have monkeypox, a disease that hasn't been reported in the nation since 1989. Cases have been reported in 3 different areas.\n\nInitial investigations show the 1st person infected in the current outbreak may have had contact with a gorilla before becoming ill. People can contract the virus from an infected animal. They may be bitten or come into contact with an infected animal's skin, blood or body fluids. Infected people can pass on the disease to others. There is no monkeypox vaccine. Prevent infection by observing hygiene and avoiding contact with animals.\n\nAdvice: do the following:\n\nObserve good personal hygiene, wash hands well and frequently.\nAvoid contact with animals.\nDo not prepare or eat 'bush meat' (wild game).\nEnsure all food is thoroughly cooked and served while hot.\nAvoid close contact with sick people.\n\nMonkeypox cases have been reported in Njikwa, Northwest province and Akwaya, Southwest province, Biyem-Assi, Central Region, Bertoua, Eastern Region, and Fotokol, Far-North Region. The 1st known cases, in Njikwa, sought medical care at the end of April [2018] for symptoms, including a rash. Samples were collected, and on 14 May [2018], one of them was confirmed to have monkeypox. The national Ministry of Health then declared an outbreak. A total of 16 cases have been reported (7 in North-west, 6 in South-west and one each from Central, Eastern and Far-North Regions). So far, only one case has been confirmed with laboratory testing. None of the patients have died.\n\nEarly investigation shows the index case, who works in a game park, may have handled a gorilla 3 weeks before becoming ill. Investigations are ongoing.\n\nMonkeypox activity has been increasing in the African region over the past several years. Since 2016, 6 countries have reported outbreaks, particularly in rural areas where people have increased interaction with animals while hunting and farming. Cameroon hasn't reported a case since 1989 and, in total, had only ever reported 3 cases prior to this outbreak.\n\nMonkeypox is a rare viral disease predominantly found in central and west Africa. People get the disease through contact with an infected animal, which can occur in a number of ways. People may be bitten or come into contact with the animal's blood or body fluids. Infection can also occur if a person touches the rash on an infected animal's skin, which sometimes happens during food preparation. Infected people can pass the disease on to other people. Symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder. They start out flu-like: fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes and a general feeling of discomfort and exhaustion. Within a few days, patients show a rash of raised bumps. The illness lasts 2-4 weeks. There is no specific treatment available for the disease. It is fatal in about 10 percent of all cases [for the central African clade, but seldom fatal for the West Africa clade. - Mod.TY].\n\nFor more information: See 'Monkeypox' in the 'Diseases and Prevention' dropdown on the International SOS Country Guides.

Since our last report on 18 May 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 20), 9 additional cases have been reported, bringing the cumulative total to 16, including one confirmed case as of 30 May 2018. No deaths have so far been reported. The ages of the affected people range from one month to 58 years, with a median age of 13 years, and the gender distribution is proportionate.\n\nIn addition to the 2 initial health districts, 3 others from 3 different regions have been affected, namely: Njikwa (7 cases) in the North-west Region; Akwaya (6) in the South-west Region; Biyem-Assi (1) in the Central Region; Bertoua (1) in the Eastern Region; and Fotokol (1) in the Far-North Region.\n\nThe outbreak of monkeypox in Cameroon was confirmed by the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun (CPC) on 14 May 2018 when one of 2 specimens (obtained from the initial cases) tested positive for orthopoxvirus/monkeypox virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The confirmed case is a 20 year old male with clinical symptoms of fever, generalized vesiculo-pustular rash and enlarged lymph nodes. Samples from 11 suspected cases have been collected and tested at the CPC. The event was initially reported to the Ministry of Health by Bjikwa health authorities on 30 Apr 2018 when the 1st 2 suspected cases were detected. The Ministry of Health formally notified WHO of the event on 15 May 2018, following laboratory confirmation.\n\nPublic health actions\n---------------------\nOn 15 May 2018, the Ministry of Health activated an Incident Management System in response to the outbreak, with support from WHO.\n- An action plan has been developed for the interventions, and the needs of the different pillars of the response (coordination, operations, logistics, and communication) have been articulated.\n- Active surveillance has been enhanced in the whole country, including case investigation of suspected cases and alerts.\n- Training of healthcare workers on using personal protective equipment and advocating proper hand hygiene have been conducted. Information related to isolation of cases, symptomatic case management, and handwashing technique have been shared.\n- A communication plan has been developed, and risk communication materials have been disseminated to increase public awareness and precautionary measures to prevent monkeypox transmission.\n- On 22 May 2018, the Regional Centre for Epidemics Prevention and Control (CERPLE) organised a coordination meeting attended by the Njikwa Health District team, WHO, UNICEF, and other stakeholders.\n\nSituation interpretation\n------------------------\nThe outbreak of monkeypox continues in Cameroon, with 5 of the 10 regions in the country reporting at least one suspected case. The cases are being reported from remote rural areas where occupational activities such as farming and hunting are increasing animal-human interaction. The detection of additional cases in the other regions could be due to enhanced surveillance following confirmation of the outbreak.\n\nThe resurgence of monkeypox in Cameroon underscores the need to maintain a high level of vigilance and raise awareness of the disease among the local population. In the absence of specific treatment or vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising public awareness of the risk factors, such as close contact with wildlife including rodents, and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus. Surveillance measures and rapid identification of new cases is critical. People infected with monkeypox should be isolated, and infection prevention and control measures should be observed in healthcare facilities caring for infected patients. Close physical contact with persons infected with monkeypox should be limited, and protective equipment such as gloves, face masks and gowns should be worn when taking care of ill people in any setting. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The previous ProMED-mail post on monkeypox cases in Cameroon did not provide numbers of cases (see ProMED-mail.

By mid-November 2017, a large outbreak caused by the West African clade resulted in 146 suspected cases and 42 laboratory-confirmed cases from 14 states. Although the source is unknown, multiple sources are suspected.\n\n[Selected summary]\n------------------\nOn [13 Oct 2017], the Nigeria CDC received laboratory confirmation of a human monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria. As of [17 Nov 2017], a total of 146 suspected cases had been reported from 22 of the 36 states in Nigeria (Figure [see URL]). Of the 134 samples (blood, lesion swab, and crust) collected during the reporting period, 107 samples were tested, and 42 samples from 14 states were laboratory confirmed as the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. Most (62 percent) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were in adults (21-40 years of age; median 30 years of age); the male:female ratio was 2:1. A 46-year-old male patient with confirmed monkeypox and a history of immunosuppressive illness died. For some patients with suspected (but ultimately deemed negative) cases of monkeypox, chickenpox (wild-type virus) was confirmed. Further analysis of the monkeypox-negative samples is ongoing.\n\nAlthough detailed epidemiologic investigations to ascertain the source and route of transmission are ongoing, 3 family clusters were found, which might suggest some level of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. For 1 of the families, the secondary attack rate was 71 percent. However, most patients had no obvious epidemiologic linkage or person-to-person contact, indicating a probable multiple-source outbreak or possibly previously unrecognized endemic disease. The zoonotic source(s) of the outbreak are currently unknown, and it is unclear what, if any, environmental or ecologic changes might have facilitated its sudden reemergence.\n\nDisclaimer [from the URL]: Ahead of print articles are not considered as final versions. Any changes will be reflected in the online version in the month the article is officially released.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report provides a good summary of the recent monkeypox (MPX) outbreak in Nigeria. It substantiates the West African clade of MPX virus as the one involved, which explains the low (almost nil) case fatality rate compared to the Central African clade. The 3 family clusters indicate that person-to-person transmission can occur, but does not account for the origin of the majority of cases. The role of rodents as reservoirs and sources of human exposure in this outbreak are unknown.\n\nA previous report indicated that the MPXV of the index case was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing, that suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population.

A couple of suspected cases have also been sent for testing.\n\nAccording to the health official, the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms of monkeypox is around 10 days, while the duration of symptoms is typically from 2-5 weeks.\n\nHe said the virus may be spread from handling bushmeat, an animal bite or scratch, body fluids, contaminated objects, or close contact with an infected person.\n\nMonkeypox was 1st identified in 1958 amongst laboratory monkeys. The 1st human cases were discovered in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nFever, itchy toes, headache, muscle pain, and swollen lymph nodes, among others, have been identified as the symptoms of the disease.\n\nThe disease is not deadly [West Africa virus clade] and can be cured [partially prevented] through the smallpox vaccine.\n\nLast year [2017], the west African country Nigeria recorded 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases of monkeypox disease between September and December 2017.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above report provides no information about the situation in which these 4 cases became infected, nor any information about the clade the responsible monkeypox virus belongs to.\n\nMonkeypox (MPX) virus infections are not as benign as the above report suggests. As noted in an earlier post (Monkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702), monkeypox is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus with a similar disease presentation to smallpox in humans, with the additional distinguishing symptom of lymphadenopathy. After an initial febrile prodrome, a centrifugally distributed maculopapular rash develops, with lesions often present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The infection can last up to 4 weeks, until crusts separate, and a fresh layer of skin is formed. Sequelae include secondary bacterial infections, respiratory distress, bronchopneumonia, gastrointestinal involvement, dehydration, encephalitis, and ocular infections, which can result in permanent corneal scarring. The virus occurs in 2 clades: The West Africa clade, with low to nil mortality, and the Central Africa clade that has a 10-17 percent fatality rate.\n\nThe main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).

Emergence of monkeypox -- West and Central Africa, 1970-2017. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2018; 67(10):306-10]\n----------------------------------\nMonkeypox cases in West Africa and Central Africa:\nSince the global eradication of smallpox, monkeypox has emerged as the most prevalent orthopoxvirus infection in humans. The majority of documented human monkeypox cases have occurred in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where it was 1st recognized as a human disease in 1970; however, during the last decade, the number of cases in other west and central African countries have been increasing; many of these countries had not reported a case for several decades [Table/Figure -- available at the source URL above]. Since 2016, monkeypox cases have been reported and confirmed from Central African Republic (19 cases), DRC (more than 1000 reported per year), Liberia (2), Nigeria (more than 80), Republic of the Congo (88), and Sierra Leone (1) (Table); an outbreak in captive chimpanzees occurred in Cameroon. With 80 confirmed cases, Nigeria is currently experiencing the largest documented outbreak of human monkeypox in West Africa. The emergence of cases is a concern for global health security.\n\nMonkeypox is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus with a similar disease presentation to smallpox in humans, with the additional distinguishing symptom of lymphadenopathy. After an initial febrile prodrome, a centrifugally distributed maculopapular rash develops, with lesions often present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The infection can last up to 4 weeks, until crusts separate, and a fresh layer of skin is formed. Sequelae include secondary bacterial infections, respiratory distress, bronchopneumonia, gastrointestinal involvement, dehydration, encephalitis, and ocular infections, which can result in permanent corneal scarring. No specific treatment for a monkeypox virus infection currently exists, and patients are managed with supportive care and symptomatic treatment. In persons who have not been vaccinated against smallpox, which offers cross-protection, the case fatality rate is 11 percent. Human-to-human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets and contact with lesions that contain the virus.\n\nMonkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West Africa and Central Africa. Although antibodies have been detected in a range of small mammal species, the reservoir species of monkeypox remains unknown, and the virus has been isolated only twice from wild animals, once from a rope squirrel (_Funisciurus anerythrus_) in DRC and once from a sooty mangabey (_Cercocebus atys_) in Cote d'Ivoire. Contact with the animal reservoir/reservoirs, including contact with live or dead animals, often through the hunting and preparation of bushmeat as food, is a presumed driver of monkeypox infection. Closer contact between humans and animals through deforestation, demographic changes, climate change, hunting, and population movement might account for the recent increase in reported cases and expansion of geographic range. Civil war and population displacement can force inhabitants to seek alternative sources of protein, including the consumption of monkeys, squirrels, and other rodents.\n\nVaccination against smallpox is known to be cross-protective against the other orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox. Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the cessation of smallpox vaccination in the early 1980s, waning vaccine-induced population immunity and lack of protection among younger age groups might have contributed to the resurgence of the disease.\n\nMonkeypox virus has 2 recognized clades: West African and Congo Basin. Differences in epidemiologic and clinical features between viral isolates support the distinction between these 2 clades. Advances in the use of DNA sequencing to understand viral strains and populations will be valuable for interpreting transmission events and confirming the existence of endemic variants. Further studies are needed to understand temporal and spatial genetic differences in viral strains.\n\nDiscussion\n--------\nMonkeypox presents challenges for public health officials and health care personnel in terms of surveillance and laboratory capacities, and management and treatment of disease.\n\nLaboratory confirmation of infection is critical, because human monkeypox closely resembles several other febrile rash illnesses including smallpox and varicella. The appropriate specimens for identification of the virus in active cases of monkeypox are swabs or crusts of lesions, in contrast to blood, serum, and sputum specimens collected by clinicians and laboratory technicians for diagnosis of many other diseases, and specimens must be accompanied by detailed clinical information for appropriate interpretation of laboratory results.\n\nThe increase in number of monkeypox cases being reported from countries in Africa that have not reported cases in several decades and the myriad factors that affect monkeypox transmission highlight the need to update knowledge about the disease and strengthen preparedness efforts. To address gaps in knowledge and expertise in areas with endemic disease, a number of areas of work are being prioritized by WHO in collaboration with CDC. To improve understanding of mechanisms of virus transmission, both zoonotic and interhuman, national disease surveillance systems need to be strengthened for humans, as well as for wildlife, using community-based event reporting. In countries with endemic disease, this includes the reporting of all suspected cases through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, collection of relevant disease-specific data to support laboratory diagnostic and epidemiological interpretation, and follow-up of confirmed cases.\n\nImprovements in laboratory capacity require training in laboratory procedures, the types of specimens to collect, and safe specimen collection, storage, and transportation. Improvements in the capacity to detect monkeypox virus have been found to increase zoonotic disease detection and response, as seen during the Ebola virus disease response in Tshuapa Province of DRC. Regional trainings to increase national-level expertise and the sharing of country-level experiences will have the potential to build a network for exchange of best practices and technical support. Global health security will benefit from additional efforts to build regional-level capacity.\n\nAs with all zoonotic diseases, a comprehensive One Health approach is necessary for disease detection and response, including wildlife surveillance and investigations into the animal reservoir/reservoirs, which require dedicated resources. Multicountry collaborations are important for sharing experiences, developing stronger national and regional capacities, and alerting neighboring countries of cases of monkeypox in humans and animals. Unlike smallpox, a human disease with no animal reservoir that was eradicated through vaccination campaigns, monkeypox has an animal reservoir/reservoirs. Insights into the animal reservoir and ecological niche will enable monitoring the virus's movements outside the natural ecological setting. Improving understanding of monkeypox will aid in developing innovative solutions to mitigate further spread of the virus. Furthermore, improved detection and response capacity for monkeypox will enhance capacity for responding to other zoonoses and orthopoxvirus events at regional and national levels.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report provides an interesting overview of the occurrence of human monkeypox cases in Africa over past years.

In countries with endemic disease, this includes the reporting of all suspected cases through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, collection of relevant disease-specific data to support laboratory diagnostic and epidemiological interpretation, and follow-up of confirmed cases.

Samples have been collected from each suspected case for laboratory confirmation. Results are still awaited. So far, there have been no deaths recorded. It is unlikely that many of the suspected cases are actually monkeypox, but all are being investigated.\n\nAll the suspected cases are currently receiving appropriate medical care, and the patients are all improving clinically in their various states. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is supporting the affected states to ensure the outbreak is brought under control and to limit further spread.\n\nNCDC has activated an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) to coordinate the outbreak investigation and response across the affected States. The EOC is currently supporting State Ministries of Health in their response to the outbreak through active case finding, epidemiological investigation, and contact tracing. Measures have been put in place to ensure effective sample collection and testing to enable laboratory confirmation. Risk communication activities have been heightened to advise the public on preventive measures. All 36 states and the FCT [Federal Capital Territory, Abuja] have been notified for preparedness.\n\nIn light of the above, it is important to be reminded that monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease with symptoms in humans similar to those seen in smallpox patients, but much less severe and with a low fatality rate. Transmission is via contact with infected animal, human, or contaminated materials. Animal-to-human transmission occurs through bite or scratch from animals and bush meat preparation. It can also be transmitted from one person to another. Human-to-human transmission occurs through respiratory droplets, contact with infected persons, or with contaminated materials. Control measures include isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, strict adherence to universal precautions, especially frequent handwashing with soap and water, and use of personal protective equipment.\n\nSigns and symptoms include fever, headache, body pain, malaise, lymphadenopathy (enlargement of glands), sore throat, the characteristic generalized vesicular rash. The rashes might last between 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is self-limiting, which means patients tend to recover with time. However, supportive care and management of condition is required and mostly successful.\n\nThe CEO, of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu again emphasizes that 'Nigerians are once advised to remain calm, avoid self-medication and report any suspected case to the nearest health facility.

Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).\n\nThe current outbreak appears to be more characteristic of direct transmission between individuals, rather than spill-over from a wild rodent reservoir, raising the question about involvement of some other transmissible pathogen such as varicella (chickenpox).

It progresses rapidly from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before crusting. The rash usually appears 1st on the head, chest, and back then spreads to the rest of the body. The lesions are usually most concentrated on the chest and back. In healthy children, varicella is generally mild, with an itchy rash, malaise, and temperature up to 102 F [38.9 C) for 2 to 3 days. Infants, adults, and immunocompromised people are at risk for more severe disease and have a higher incidence of complications.

Regardless, residents continue to panic over the mystery nature of the pox.\n\nAkwa Ibom state has recorded one confirmed case while 2 other cases are still under investigation. Commissioner for Health, Dr Dominic Ukpong, disclosed this in an interview with newsmen in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state capital on [Sat 7 Oct 2017].\n\nAccording to Dr Ukpong, 'the era of avoiding excessive handshake and body contact is here again. 'We should at the moment re-awaken the continued emphasis on regular hand washing and avoiding the consumption of bush meat at the moment.'\n\nConfirming the breakout, Akwa Ibom state commissioner for information, Mr Charles Udoh said: 'Monkeypox currently has no treatment and no vaccine. It looks like smallpox but the rashes are larger while the disease is milder,' assuring that 'we will provide more information in subsequent releases.'\n\nMeanwhile, the monkeypox has begun to take a heavy toll on the social and economic life in Bayelsa. Owing to the contagious nature of the boil-like viral infection, most residents in the state have become extra-careful of the water they drink. Most residents have stopped buying sachet water from Agbura axis of the state in Yenagoa Local Government where the epidemic reportedly broke out.\n\nA particular sachet water packaging company (name withheld) in Agbura, has shut down operation, owing to non-patronage as their numerous customers now buy sachet water from other communities in the state. The situation has created a short supply of sachet water in Agbura and other parts of Yenagoa with high demand from population of low income earners who cannot afford bottled.\n\nAlso, the continuous jingles running on the state radio warning residents not to consume bush meat, antelopes, and monkey had affected operators of restaurants, particularly for fear of contacting monkeypox.\n\nA woman whose beer parlour and bush meat restaurant is a popular rendezvous, has continued to count her losses saying, 'business has been very bad. My customers have stopped coming; residents are now scared of eating bush meat, gradually throwing one out of business. Some food vendors have decided to go into other businesses.' A food vendor, said, 'Because of fear of contracting the disease, markets in the state are no longer crowded with customers purchasing meat as it was prior to the outbreak of the monkeypox in the state.'\n\nWhen asked for update on the 47 persons quarantined over the disease, the state Commissioner for Health, Professor Ebitimitula Etebu, said the number of victims had increased from 11 to 13 and contact index increased to 50, even as he posited that the victims, including a 17-year-old boy are responding to treatment and were at various stages of recovery. He also called on the people of the state to report any person with rashes, particularly boil-like rashes which constituted a strong symptom of the disease.\n\nHe said further that government was proactive, and had set up a committee 'Quick Response Search Medical Team'' to go into the local governments, communities, and fishing settlements to control the spread of the disease.\n\nEtebu, however, reiterated that government was prepared to cater for the medical bills of all those that had showed symptoms, even as he appealed to residents with the rashes to voluntarily submit themselves to the government for medical care.\n\n[Byline: Ikenna Amadi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Apparently, cases of monkeypox are appearing in new locations in Nigeria. There seems to be concern about person-to-person spread of the virus. The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance of limited spread in the Republic of the Congo. Concern about a water source is likely unfounded but bush meat as a source of the virus has a basis in fact. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox in nature are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Pouched rats (_Cricetomys_ spp) have been shown experimentally to be susceptible to monkeypox virus infection. These rats are considered a delicacy and are available for purchase in many markets. It is likely that these human cases represent spill-over from a wild rodent reservoir, rather than from a human-based outbreak. Further epidemiological studies of these cases and the places where transmission may have occurred are needed.\n\nAs noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent, than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities.

It has not been confirmed. We have sent samples to the World Health Organisation's reference laboratory in Dakar, Senegal.\n\n'When that comes out, we will be sure that it is confirmed. But from all indications, it points towards it.\n\n'As the name implies, the virus was 1st seen in monkey, but can also be found in all bush animals such as rats, squirrels and antelopes.\n\n'The source is usually all animals. It was 1st seen in monkeys and that is why it is called monkeypox. But every bush animals such as rats, squirrels, and antelopes are involved.\n\n'So, the secretions from particularly dead animals are highly contagious.'\n\nHe listed the symptoms of monkeypox as severe headache, fever, back pains, etc., noting that most worrisome of all the signs are rashes bigger than those caused by chicken pox.\n\nThe commissioner said the rashes are usually frightening and usually spread to the entire body of infected persons.\n\nSpeaking on the Bayelsa case, Etebu stated, 'We noticed the 1st index case from Agbura, where somebody was purported to have killed and eaten a monkey and after that, the people who are neighbours and families started developing the rashes.\n\n'We have seen cases from as far as Biseni. We invited the NCDC together withour own epidemiological team from the Bayelsa Ministry of Health.\n\n'We have been able to trace most of the people who have come in contact with the patients.\n\n'So far, we have 10 patients and we have created an isolation centre at the NDUTH and most of them are on admission and we are following up the 49 cases [contacts] that we are suspecting might come down with the illness.\n\n'As a state, we are taking care of all the expenses of all the isolated cases.\n\n'The disease has an incubation period and it is also self-limiting in the sense that within 2-4 weeks, you get healed and it confers you with immunity for life.\n\n'We have mobilised virtually every arsenal at our disposal in terms of sensitising the general public and making them aware by radio programmes, jingles and fliers. So, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control has mobilised fully to Bayelsa State. We are on top of the situation.\n\n'The only thing I will tell the general public is to observe hand hygiene and ensure they don't come in contact with dead animals and their secretions. The disease is air-borne too. So when you come down with it, it is very infectious.\n\n'People should wash their hands whenever they go in or come out of their houses. If they come in touch with animals, they should ensure that they wash their hands.\n\n'They should be very vigilant. People should report any similar cases to the relevant authorities.\n\n'A lot of people have come down with the symptoms, but they are hiding in their houses. If they hide, there is the propensity for the infection to spread.\n\n'It is better to quarantine them and treat them so that we can interrupt the spread of the disease.\n\n'People should be calm and they shouldn't get frightened.

Following this confirmation, a mission of the Pasteur Institute, supported by the Ministry of Health and the WHO country office, made it possible to collect from a pygmy camp last weekend 26 samples from contacts, and the analysis of sera in the Pasteur Institute laboratory shows that 24 (92.3 percent) had antibodies directed against monkeypox and 4 against cowpox.\n\nThese findings show a strong circulation of the virus in the region and permanent contact with the reservoir, which explains the low number of cases recorded during the epidemics, as most people are immunized.\n\nThe priorities of the Pasteur Institute team in Bangui today are to reinforce surveillance at the level of fauna and to identify the reservoir species of this virus, which, in view of the increasingly close occurrence of the episodes of epidemics, seems to constitute a real public health problem for the future.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nNikola Sklenovska\nKU Leuven\nLeuven, Belgium\n<nikolasklenovska@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Nikola Sklenovska for submitting this report.\n\nIt is not clear whether the 2 confirmed monkeypox cases mentioned above are included in an earlier report.

During reporting week 13 (week ending 31 Mar 2017), 6 new cases were reported from 3 districts, distributed equally (2 cases each) among Betou, Dongou and Impfondo.\n\nAs of 28 Mar 2017, a cumulative total of 26 suspected cases including 4 deaths (case fatality rate of 15 percent) has been reported since onset of the outbreak on 21 Jan 2017.\n\nThe outbreak has so far been localized to Likouala province, where 4 districts have been affected: Betou (6 cases, no death), Dongou (13 cases, 2 deaths), Enyelle (4 cases and 1 death) and Impfondo (3 cases, 1 death).\n\nThe index case in this outbreak was found to have originated from Manfou\u00e9t\u00e9 town, Dongou district. Manfou\u00e9t\u00e9 is an isolated town with a limited communication network (telephones and internet access), road transport, lack of electricity, inadequate numbers of trained health workers, and low health service coverage.\n\nIn addition, the high population movement between Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, including influx of refugees from these countries and others like Chad, poses a high risk of propagation of the outbreak to other provinces of Congo and the neighboring countries.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows: About 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired. One to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too. The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off. The illness usually lasts for 2-4 weeks.\n\nRodents such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts.\n\nPeople at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or who have contact with the animal's rash, blood or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for monkeypox.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although described as a single outbreak, the cases are occurring in 4 districts in Likouala province, located in the far northeast part of the country. The above report provides no evidence of human-to-human transmission, which is rare and cannot be sustained. The risk of infected people spreading the virus to neighboring countries does not seem high. This situation makes one wonder whether there is an increased incidence of monkeypox virus infection in rodent reservoirs with spill-over to humans. Occurrence of sporadic cases is not surprising because monkeypox virus is endemic in the Republic of the Congo, the DR Congo, and human cases occur sporadically there as well in the Central African Republic.\n\nAs noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent, than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities.

Epidemiological investigations are currently on-going to evaluate the magnitude of the outbreak.\n\nPublic health response:\n- strengthening public health surveillance for possible cases;\n- training healthcare workers on using personal protective equipment, and advocating proper hand hygiene and cleaning procedures in the health care setting;\n- installing 2 isolation units for case management;\n- provision of free care for patients affected with monkeypox;\n- increasing public awareness to take precautionary measure to prevent monkeypox transmission;\n- engaging International Medical Corps and the Catholic Organisation for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) to support case management and prevention measures.\n\nWHO risk assessment\nSmall scale monkeypox outbreaks regularly occur in tropical Africa. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans through contact with an infected animal or through infected animal bites. Person-to-person transmission can also occur during outbreaks through close contact with patients but there is no evidence to date that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox transmission in humans.\n\nGiven the lack of adequately equipped isolation units in healthcare facilities in the area and the known transmission dynamics of monkeypox between humans, WHO encourages individuals and healthcare workers to follow infection prevention and control procedures when caring for patients, to prevent transmission of disease.\n\nGiven the location of the outbreak in a relatively remote and sparsely populated area at this stage the risk of international spread seems limited.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction for travel and trade to Central African Republic based on available information at this point in time.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[A previous ProMED-mail report on 28 Sep 2016 indicated that there were human monkeypox cases in both Basse-Kotto and Haute-Kotto health districts. The above WHO report only mentions the Haute-Kotto district. The number of cases continues to increase.\n\nMonkeypox cases are reported sporadically in the Central African Republic (CAR). This is a summary of the 2nd reported outbreak this year (2016). There have been human cases of monkeypox virus infection reported previously in the CAR. As noted in the comment in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20160119.3947756), Dr Mirdad Kazanji, director of the Institut Pasteur at Bangui, indicated that the phylogenetic tree showed that a 2010 monkeypox isolate was identical to the Democratic Republic of the Congo strain circulating in central Africa. This reported strain was identical to one associated with an outbreak of monkeypox in 2001 in a Bantu family living on the border between the CAR and the DRC, 480 km (about 300 miles) from the 2010 cases.\n\nIt would be of interest to know to which clade the current monkeypox virus belongs, and which wild animals are the reservoirs in the Central African Republic. Given the human fatalities, one would assume that the monkeypox virus responsible in the current outbreak is the Central African one that occurs in the DR Congo.\n\nThe virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance in the Republic of the Congo.

Following epidemiological investigation and sampling, the Research center for Armies health (CRESAR) performed analyses and confirmed the presence of simian orthopoxvirus, which is the causal agent responsible for a zoonotic disease known as Monkeypox. Poxvirus Congo basin strain was identified. The group of 22 chimpanzees (1 sick plus 1 dead) used to live in a 3-hectares enclosure isolated from the other compartments of the sanctuary (18 enclosures). Clinical signs were: lack of appetite and progressive occurrence of nodules and blisters on the face. The sanctuary is populated with chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys (300 in total) over about 900 hectares. It is compartmentalized and fenced. Animals were introduced within the sanctuary. Quarantine was applied (sick animals kept inside the enclosure) and biosecurity measures are reinforced for the staff working within the enclosure.

With the new cases, the health zone recorded 195 cases including 8 deaths, said Akonda.\n\nThe battle against the outbreak is especially problematic due to lack of qualified medical personnel, equipment, collection kits, and lack of sanitation. 'We only have one qualified nurse in Bombongolo. When he moves, it is the orderlies who care for the sick. Healers also monopolize the sick to offer them miracle healings, ' added Dr Innocent Akonda.\n\nMonkeypox is a relatively rare virus found primarily in central and western Africa. The disease is caused by monkeypox virus. It is closely related to the smallpox virus (variola), the virus used in the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia), and the cowpox virus. Infection with monkeypox is not as serious as its cousin, smallpox; however, human deaths have been attributed to monkeypox.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the symptoms of monkeypox are as follows:\n- About 12 days after people are infected with the virus, they will get a fever, headache, muscle aches, and backache; their lymph nodes will swell; and they will feel tired.\n- 1 to 3 days (or longer) after the fever starts, they will get a rash. This rash develops into raised bumps filled with fluid and often starts on the face and spreads, but it can start on other parts of the body too.\n- The bumps go through several stages before they get crusty, scab over, and fall off.\nThe illness usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nRodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice, and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts. The monkeypox virus in the Congo has a higher case fatality rate than the virus in West Africa, where fatal cases are rare or absent, according to a ProMED moderator [Monkeypox, human - Congo DR: susp. 20120917.1297716].\n\nPeople at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or if you have contact with the animal's rash, blood, or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing [this is extremely rare. - Mod.TY].

Two clades of monkeypox viruses, the West African and Congo Basin viruses, have been identified. The Congo Basin viruses are more virulent. Monkeypox virus is closely related to some other orthopoxviruses such as variola (smallpox) virus, and it cannot be distinguished from these viruses in some laboratory tests.\n\n'Monkeypox is endemic in central Africa (the Congo Basin) and West Africa. An outbreak of human monkeypox occurred in the US in 2003. In the US, cases were seen in pet prairie dogs, other small mammals in captivity, and people who had been exposed to infected prairie dogs. There have been no reports of infections among humans or domesticated animals in North America since 2003, and limited surveys suggest that the virus probably did not enter wild animal populations.\n\n'Most cases of monkeypox in humans are zoonotic. This virus is thought to be transmitted to people in bites from animals, in aerosols during close contact, or by direct contact with lesions, blood or body fluids. In Africa, human outbreaks have often been linked to handling, preparing and eating wild animals. In the US, most cases occurred among people who had close direct contact with prairie dogs; some infections were apparently acquired in scratches and bites, or through open wounds. Human-to-human transmission can also occur. Potential routes of transmission between people include contact with skin lesions or infectious body fluids, or aerosol transmission during prolonged face-to-face contact.\n\n'The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends disinfection of contaminated surfaces with 0.5 percent sodium hypochlorite or other EPA-approved high-level disinfectants. Incineration or autoclaving is appropriate for some contaminated materials.

The cases were reported to\nthe Institut Pasteur at Bangui. The lesions developed after the boys\nhad hunted and eaten a wild rodent (bemba). They both presented to a\nhealth centre one week after eruption of the extensive lesions, which\ncovered the face, torso, and limbs. Both boys were systemically well,\nwith no fever or notable lymphadenopathy.\n\nLaboratory investigations were done on serum and scabs and on a biopsy\nsample from the brain of a young mouse that had been inoculated 5 days\nearlier with scab material from the lesions. Monkeypox virus was\ndetected by quantitative PCR based on partial haemagglutinin gene and\nidentified by sequencing. The phylogenetic tree showed that the strain\nwas identical to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, formerly\nZaire) strain circulating in central Africa. This reported strain was\nidentical to one associated with an outbreak of monkeypox in 2001 in a\nBantu family living on the border between the CAR and the DRC, 480 km\n[about 300 miles] from the cases reported here.\n\nOur patients were admitted to the local health centre and kept in\nisolation until they were no longer infectious. When last seen a week\nafter discharge, in June 2010, both were well and neither showed any\nsequelae.\n\nMonkeypox virus has a wide range of hosts, so it can maintain a\nreservoir in wild animals while sporadically causing human disease,\ngenerally in remote villages in the rainforest areas of central and\nwest Africa. Large outbreaks, with transmission between people, occur\nonly in the DRC. The case-fatality rate in Africa is between 1 percent\nand 10 percent. There is no specific treatment or vaccine although\nsmallpox vaccination is 85 percent effective in preventing monkeypox.\nIn 2003, the 1st human monkeypox outbreak in the western hemisphere\nwas reported in the USA after importation of rodents from Ghana.\n\nWe have describe the occurrence of 2 typical cases of monkeypox,\ncaused by the same viral genotype, 10 years after the previous\ninfections with this strain.

At least 3 health zones are\naffected. For example, in the Bikoro health zone, 114 people have\ncontracted the disease and 5 have died.\n\nAccording to the WHO Equateur provincial branch, the Bikoro health zone has\nbroken the record with 114 cases. Most of the cases have been reported in\nthe Mooto health area, about 82 kilometers [51 mi] from Mbandaka.\n\nTwo weeks ago, medical authorities suspected the presence of a similar\ndisease in the Gbadolite health zone. According to the WHO/Equateur\nregional medical officer, Louis Pia, laboratory tests on specimens from\npatients that were sent to the INRB (National Institute for Biomedical\nResearch) in Kinshasa, confirmed that the cause was monkeypox virus.\n\nThe disease has been reported also in Boende health zone. The same\nconfirmation has been made on specimens taken from patients [in Boende]. It\nis still unclear how many have been infected [overall in Equateur].\n\nTo deal with this epidemic, medical advice is for observation of hygiene\nrules. The medical officer also asked farmers in the affected health zones\nnot pick up dead animals in the forest, including monkeys, squirrels, and\npangolins that transmit this disease to humans.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A recent investigation suggests that monkeypox virus, to which the\nsmallpox vaccine also provides immunity, is now at least 20 times as common\nas it was shortly after the eradication of smallpox and the relaxation of\nimmunisation. (For a detailed discussion see ProMED-mail Monkeypox,\nincreased incidence - Congo DR 20100901.3124, and AW Rimoina et al.

A new\nstudy suggests that the monkeypox virus, which\nthe smallpox vaccine also grants immunity\nagainst, is now at least 20 times as common as it\nwas shortly after victory over smallpox had been declared.\n\n'The eradication of smallpox was one of the\ngreatest achievements known to man,' lead\nresearcher Anne Rimoin of the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles School of Public Health\ntold Reuters Health. 'But a consequence of\nceasing smallpox vaccinations is that now the\nworld's population is vulnerable to other (related viruses) such as monkeypox.'\n\nWhile the infection is somewhat less serious than\nsmallpox, it can still scar and even kill its\nvictims. And in contrast to its cousin, monkeypox\nis not only able to jump between humans, but can\ninfect through contact with small animals that\nharbor the virus. As a result, its control could\nbe all the more challenging, warned Rimoin.\n\nConverging political, social, economic and\nenvironmental factors make African nations -- in\nparticular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n-- especially vulnerable to the infection, she\nexplained. The virus's favorite animal hosts such\nas squirrels and monkeys are endemic [abundant]\nthere, and civil war has forced many people to\nrely heavily on hunting wildlife for sustenance.\nSome have even migrated deep into the animals'\nforest habitats to seek refuge from the violence.\n\n'The virus has probably been on the rise for\nyears, but the country lacked surveillance,'\nRimoin noted. 'To find disease, you have to look\nfor it.' So she and her colleagues, who included\nmany local Congolese, did just that. Using\nChinese bicycles like pack mules to transport\nsupplies, and with funding from the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health, they surveyed 9 local\nhealth zones for signs of monkeypox between\nNovember 2005 and November 2007. They identified\n760 cases of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox.\n\nCompared to similar surveillance conducted in the\n1980s, Rimoin's team found a 20-fold increase in\nmonkeypox cases -- far more than they ever\nexpected to find. In a single health zone, the\naverage number of yearly cases rose from less\nthan 1 to roughly 14 per 10 000 people.\n\nMost of the victims were born after smallpox\nvaccination was officially discontinued in 1980.\nVaccinated individuals were more than 5 times\nless likely to become infected with monkeypox\ncompared to those without the vaccine's\nprotection, the researchers report in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract reproduced below].\n\n'What we're seeing is a harbinger of things to\ncome,' said Rimoin. She warned that the virus\ncould grow more widespread with further\ndeforestation, continued movement of people from\nrural to urban areas, bushmeat trafficking and\nimportation of exotic pets. 'And every new\ninfection provides the virus with the opportunity\nto evolve into a more serious or transmissible virus,' she added.\n\nIt's already clear that the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo isn't the only home for the virus.\nThe Republic of the Congo and Sudan also reported\ncases in recent years. And in 2003, monkeypox\narrived in the U.S. Midwest with imported African\nrodents, before spreading among prairie dogs and\nsickening 90 people. Experts fear an even more\nvirulent and efficient virus could return to the western world.\n\n'The higher the rate of new infections, the\ngreater the chance that travelers from the U.S.\nwill be exposed, and that the disease will be\nimported into the U.S. -- possibly establishing\nitself in U.S. rodent populations,' Dr. Dan\nDiGiulio of Stanford University School of\nMedicine in California, who was not involved in\nthe study, noted in an e-mail message to Reuters Health.\n\nSo what can be done to keep the virus at bay?\nRimoin suggested that behavioral interventions\nmay be the most effective strategy at this point,\nincluding teaching people at risk of infection\nwhat animals may be most likely to carry\nmonkeypox and how to handle them to avoid\ninfection, as well as isolating infected\nindividuals. Continued active surveillance is\nalso important to better identify the animal\nreservoirs and rates of animal-to-human versus\nhuman-to-human transmission. 'Once we understand\nmore about this virus and what it may mean for\nus,' she said, 'we may be able to consider\nspecific interventions, perhaps vaccinating\ngroups that are at significant risk of\ninfection.' DiGiulio added the need for animal\nimportation policies, and research into effective\nantiviral treatments and vaccine development.\n\n'Three decades after the eradication of smallpox,\npox viruses still deserve our close attention,'\nsaid Rimoin. 'And we shouldn't only worry about\nits accidental introduction but also as a deliberate terrorist release.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is the reference and abstract for\nthe publication discussed in the above press report.\n\nTitle: Major increase in human monkeypox\nincidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination\ncampaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthors: Anne W.

Active,\npopulation-based surveillance was conducted in 9\nhealth zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data\nand biological samples were obtained from\nsuspected cases. Cumulative incidence (per 10 000\npopulation) and major determinants of infection\nwere compared with data from active surveillance\nin similar regions from 1981 to 1986.\n\nBetween November 2005 and November 2007, 760\nlaboratory-confirmed human monkeypox cases were\nidentified in participating health zones. The\naverage annual cumulative incidence across zones\nwas 5.53 per 10 000 (2.18\u00ad14.42). Factors\nassociated with increased risk of infection\nincluded: living in forested areas, male gender,\nage <15, and no prior smallpox vaccination.\nVaccinated persons had a 5.2-fold lower risk of\nmonkeypox than unvaccinated persons (0.78 vs. 4.05 per 10,000).\n\nComparison of active surveillance data in the\nsame health zone from the 1980s (0.72 per 10 000)\nand 2006\u00ad07 (14.42 per 10 000) suggests a 20-fold\nincrease in human monkeypox incidence. 30 years\nafter mass smallpox vaccination campaigns ceased,\nhuman monkeypox incidence has dramatically\nincreased in rural DRC.

Most of those affected were refugees from\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo younger than 15. 'The clinical\nsigns confirmed the disease,' he said.\nMonkeypox is a rare viral disease found mostly in the rainforest\ncountries of central and West Africa, characterized by a high fever\naccompanied by intense fatigue and [pox-like] lesions, Mombouli said.\n'There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease,' he said. 'The\nrecovery is spontaneous.' [In fact, smallpox vaccination protects\nagainst infection, or failing that, mitigates the severity. -\nMod.JW] Infection follows physical contact with animals, especially\nmonkeys, during the preparation of meat, he said. According to\nMombouli, the virus had adapted to the human species. 'If we neglect\nthe virus and let it evolve, it will become more virulent and lethal,' he said.\nThe outbreak started in January [2007], with the last case being\nregistered at end-August [2007]. The disease was spread out over a\n200km [124-mile] radius in Likouala and affected villages along the\nRiver Oubangui.

The study could help officials trying to\ncome up with a plan for mass-vaccination against the often deadly\nsmallpox virus and its relatives, should such a virus ever be used in\na biological attack.\nThe researchers found 3 people who were evidently infected by the\nmonkeypox virus, spread mostly by pet prairie dogs in the Midwest,\nwho never had any symptoms. The 3 had last been vaccinated against\nsmallpox before the jabs were discontinued. One was vaccinated 13\nyears ago, another 29 years ago and the third 48 years ago. 'These\nindividuals were unaware that they had been infected, because they\nwere spared any recognizable disease symptoms,' Mark Kenneth Slifka,\nof Oregon Health & Sciences University, and colleagues wrote in their\nreport, published in the journal Nature Medicine [see below].\n'Together, this shows that the U.S. monkeypox outbreak was larger\nthan previously realized and, more importantly, shows that\ncross-protective antiviral immunity against West African monkeypox\ncan potentially be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination.'\nSmallpox was eradicated in 1979 after a global vaccination program.\nBut experts fear the virus or a related virus could be used as a\nbiological weapon. About half the U.S. adult population has been\nvaccinated as part of routine efforts that stopped in 1972 for\ncivilians and 1990 for the military. Studies have shown that immunity\nlasts as long as 75 years.\nNow work is underway to stockpile doses of vaccine in case of an\nattack, while tests are also underway to see whether perhaps some\npeople might be protected by their old vaccinations. But no one has\nbeen able to do a real test of how well the vaccine protects, until\nthe monkeypox outbreak, traced to pet rodents imported from West\nAfrica, where the close relative of smallpox is well entrenched and\nstill common.\nThe team tested 44 people from Wisconsin, the epicenter of the\noutbreak, which originated at a pet store in Illinois. At least 39\npeople were reported infected with monkeypox in Wisconsin, they said.\n'We screened subjects and included in the study only those who had\nclose contact with monkeypox-infected individuals or\nmonkeypox-infected prairie dogs,' they wrote. They found 3 people who\nhad clear evidence of infection in their blood, yet never showed any\nsymptoms of monkeypox. All had been previously vaccinated against\nsmallpox.\nThey also found that the monkeypox viruses spread even without direct\ncontact, something to be aware of should there ever be a smallpox\nattack. 'A common misconception of the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is\nthat infection requires direct contact or direct inoculation through\nscratches or bites in order for infected prairie dogs to transmit\nmonkeypox to humans,' the researchers wrote. But the virus apparently\ncan be carried in the air and by tiny sneezed droplets. 'In one case,\na subject contracted monkeypox after an infected prairie dog was\ncarried into her home when she was not present. The prairie dog was\napparently not placed on the floor or furniture, and yet this\nsubject, who had no contact with prairie dogs or other individuals\nwith monkeypox, contracted the disease,' they wrote.\n--\nGeorge A.

The Abstract states that 'Approximately 50 percent\nof the US population received smallpox vaccinations before routine\nimmunization ceased in 1972 for civilians and in 1990 for military\npersonnel. Several studies have shown long-term immunity after\nsmallpox vaccination, but skepticism remains as to whether this will\ntranslate into full protection against the onset of\northopoxvirus-induced disease. The US monkeypox outbreak of 2003\nprovided the opportunity to examine this issue. Using independent and\ninternally validated diagnostic approaches with 95 percent\nsensitivity and 90 percent specificity for detecting clinical\nmonkeypox infection, we identified 3 previously unreported cases of\nmonkeypox in preimmune individuals at 13, 29 and 48 years after\nsmallpox vaccination. These individuals were unaware that they had\nbeen infected because they were spared any recognizable disease\nsymptoms.

During the outbreak, health officials counted 72 confirmed or suspected\ncases of human monkeypox, but no deaths. The disease usually kills about 10\npercent of infected people.\n'We have at least 2 biological strains of monkeypox virus -- one on the west\ncoast of Africa, and the other in the Congo basin. The 2003 outbreak in the\nUnited States was from West Africa. If it had come from the Congo, we might\nhave had a bigger problem on our hands and very well might have seen patient\ndeaths,' study senior author Mark Buller of Saint Louis University Health\nSciences Center, said in a prepared statement.\nMonkeypox belongs to a family of viruses that causes human smallpox, cowpox,\ncamelpox [and includes several other related orthoviruses]. Monkeypox symptoms\ninclude fever, respiratory problems, and pus-filled blisters on the body.\nMonkeypox is a zoonosis -- an animal disease that can be transmitted to humans.\nRecent studies suggest that cases of monkeypox in Africa are on the rise due to\nhuman encroachment into the habitats of animals that carry the virus, Buller\nsaid.\nThe U.S. outbreak was caused by a shipment of West African rodents imported for\nthe pet trade. At a pet distribution center, the African rodents infected\nprairie dogs that were sold as pets. The findings are reported in the July\nissue of the Journal 'Virology' [see below].\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 16 Jul 2005\nFrom: Pablo Nart <pablo11@hotPOP.com>\nSource: The Milwaukee Channel online, Fri 15 Jul 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.themilwaukeechannel.com/news/4730260/detail.html>\n\nUSA: Monkeypox Outbreak in 2003 Involved Weaker Virus\n-----------------------------------------------------\nMonkeypox virus, a less deadly relative of smallpox virus, kills up to 10\npercent of its victims in Africa. Yet the monkeypox outbreak 2 years ago in the\nUnited States killed no one, and scientists have wondered why.\nNow they have a good idea. New research finds that there are 2 distinct strains\nof the virus, and that the U.S. outbreak involved the weaker West African\nstrain rather than the more deadly Congolese strain. The illness was spread by\nprairie dogs after they were infected by imported African rodents at a pet\ndistribution center. 'If it had come from Congo, we might have had a bigger\nproblem on our hands and very well might have seen patient deaths,'said Mark\nBuller, a St. Louis University virologist who led the federally funded study,\npublished on Fri 15 Jul 2005 in 'Virology' [see below].\nScientists from the U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases\n[USAMRIID], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], and 4 other\nuniversities in the United States and Canada worked on the report.\nThe monkeypox outbreak 2 summers ago was the 1st in the Western Hemisphere. An\nestimated 72 people in the Midwest were sickened by the virus, which causes\nblisters and a rash that resemble smallpox. Cases were reported in Wisconsin,\nIllinois, Indiana, Kansas, Ohio & Missouri. 16 people were hospitalized, though\nnot all were sick. 2 children required intensive care and recovered. The\nmonkeypox outbreak included 39 confirmed or suspected cases from Wisconsin,\nwhere the disease was first detected. The initial case involved a 3-year-old\nchild in Wausau, who got it from a pet prairie dog her mother bought at a 4-H\nswap meet in the spring of 2003. It and other infected prairie dogs had been\nhoused near imported Gambian rats by animal distributors.\nDoctors thought better U.S. medical care and generally better health than in\nAfrica were the reasons no one died. But genetic analysis suggests the germ\nitself made the difference. Researchers compared several strains similar to the\nWest African one in the U.S. outbreak to a Congolese strain from a gene bank.\nThey also looked back at previously unpublished experiments Army researchers\nhad done in the 1990s on such viruses in monkeys as part of an effort to find\nways to test new smallpox vaccines. Monkeys infected with the West African\nstrain got only mildly ill and none died. 5 out of 6 of those given the other\nstrain got severely ill and all 3 that got the higher dose of it died.\nAfter the 2003 outbreak, federal officials banned the importation of African\nrodents and the sale of U.S. prairie dogs [but is exchanging them at a 'swap\nmeet' -- see above -- still legal? - Mod.JW], but importing animals from other\ncountries is still legal, along with breeding captive exotic and wild\nanimals. 'We definitely are better off than we were' before the outbreak in\nterms of regulation, said Dr. Marty Cetron, the CDC's director of quarantine,\nbut he added, 'there's still more that could be done.' 'We do think there is a\nrisk of emerging infections being spread by or amplified by the exotic pet\ntrade,' he said [but prairie dogs are not exotic in the sense of not imported.-\nMod.JW].\n--\nPablo Nart\n<pablo11@hotPOP.com>\n[The paper referred to in the above reports is published in the current issue\nof Virology\n(<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_aset=V-WA-A-W-AV-MsSA\nYWW-UUA-U-AAWVAWAZYY-AAWADUWVYY-WBUEDDWZC-AV-U&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_udi=B6W\nXR-4GMJ900-1&_coverDate=07%2F14%\n2F2005&_cdi=7165&_orig=search&_st=13&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&\n_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=fb43d5830e6\ne05c8f89ffb2fd429f647>.\nThe paper is authored by Nanhai Chen and 15 others and is entitled: ' Virulence\ndifferences between monkeypox virus isolates from West Africa and the Congo\nbasin'.\nThe Abstract of the paper reads as follows: 'Studies indicate that West African\nand Congo basin isolates of monkeypox virus (MPXV) are genetically distinct.\nHere, we show Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-V79 is more virulent for cynomolgus monkeys\nas compared to presumed West African MPXV-COP-58.

The finding of so many mild cases\nand no deaths so far is surprising. Some have commented that it is the\n'comorbidity' present in Africa that enhances the impact of monkeypox. I\nfind this explanation to be facile; there is no evidence that any\nparticular disease impacts on the outcome of infection with the virus in\nAfrica and there is no evidence that concomitant malnutrition or other\ncondition is needed to make monkeypox a serious disease. This may be so,\nbut I don't know of any data.\nIn fact, the only cases of monkeypox I have seen were in pygmies in the mid\n1980s and the general health of the group was quite good, although the\nstate of the recovering children reminded me very much of that of persons\nrecovering from measles with the added visible lymphadenopathy. Which of\ncourse brings to mind another obvious explanation for the mild course in\nthe US. There is better supportive care. This doesn't wash because the\ncases seem to be quite mild and not snatched from the jaws of death by\nnursing, antipyretics, rehydrations, and antibiotic treatment of secondary\ninfections as we attribute to differences in measles mortality.\nThere are, of course, many possible speculations including host and viral\ngenetics, recent passage in prairie dogs, etc. I would like to suggest a\nrather off-the-wall, but not unreasonable, idea that should be factored\ninto the equation: route of inoculation. This idea originates from the old\npractice of smallpox prevention by 'variolation' or 'inoculation'. Smallpox\nvirus was introduced into the skin or nasal mucous membrane of a\nsusceptible person and the resulting disease was relatively mild and\nimmunized.

The Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) is confident that this shipment is the\nsource of the current U.S. outbreak of monkeypox. As a result, the\nagency is recommending the quarantine and euthanasia of all animals\nfrom the shipment, as well as prairie dogs from the U.S. that were\nexposed to the imported species or to other animals suspected of\nhaving monkeypox.\nPet prairie dogs are believed to be the main source of the human\nmonkeypox outbreak that emerged in the U.S. last month. 'The goal is\nto protect people, pets and wildlife in the United States, by\npreventing the monkeypox virus from spreading or becoming established\npermanently,' the CDC's Dr. Martin Cetron said in a statement.\nThe CDC previously recommended quarantine of animals infected or\nexposed to monkeypox. The new recommendations call for euthanizing\nthese animals. 'These measures are essential in order to effectively\naddress this public health issue,' Cetron said. 'This truly\ncollaborative effort requires the support of public health officials,\nthe pet industry, and pet owners to successfully contain this\noutbreak.'\nAs of Tue 1 Jul 2003, the CDC was investigating 81 suspect or\nprobable human cases of monkeypox -- 39 in Wisconsin, 22 in Indiana,\n16 in Illinois, 2 in Missouri, and one each from Kansas and Ohio. 32\nhuman cases have been laboratory-confirmed. Wisconsin has the highest\nnumber of lab-confirmed cases at 14, followed by Illinois with 8,\nIndiana with 7, Kansas with 2, and Missouri with one.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 2 Jul 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: MMWR 2 Jul 2003 / 52(Dispatch);1-3\n\nUpdate: Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox --- Illinois, Indiana,\nKansas, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, 2003\nCDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate\ncases of monkeypox among persons who had contact with wild or exotic\nmammalian pets or persons with monkeypox (1--3). This report updates\nepidemiologic, laboratory, and smallpox vaccine use data for U.S.\ncases, and summarizes the laboratory-based evidence implicating\nimported African rodents as the probable source of the outbreak.\nAs of 2 Jul 2003, a total of 81 cases of monkeypox have been reported\nto CDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (22), Illinois (16), Missouri\n(2), Kansas (one), and Ohio (one) (Figure); these include 32 (40\npercent) cases laboratory-confirmed at CDC and 49 (60 percent)\nsuspect and probable cases under investigation. One case was excluded\nfrom those reported in the previous update because it met the\nexclusion criteria outlined in the updated case definition, and 3\nwere added (3). Of the 81 cases, 43 (53 percent) were among females;\nthe median age was 27 years (range: 1--51 years). Age data were\nunavailable for one patient. Among 78 patients for whom data were\navailable, 19 (24 percent) were hospitalized. The previously reported\nchild with painful adenopathy associated with diffuse pox lesions\nimproved clinically and was discharged from the hospital after 6 days\n(3). Confirmatory testing of skin rash lesions at CDC was positive\nfor monkeypox virus.\nOf the 81 reported cases, 31 have been laboratory confirmed at CDC\nfor monkeypox by detection of virus in skin rash lesions by using\nculture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical\ntesting, and/or electron microscopy; one case was confirmed by virus\nisolation and PCR testing of an oropharyngeal specimen. The number of\nconfirmed cases by state includes Wisconsin (14), Indiana (7),\nIllinois (8), Missouri (2), and Kansas (one). For these\nlaboratory-confirmed cases, the onset of illness ranged from 16 May\nto 20 Jun 2003. All confirmed patients reported a rash, and all but\none reported at least one other clinical sign or symptom, including\nfever, respiratory symptoms, and/or lymphadenopathy. The median\nincubation period* was 12 days (range: 1--31 days). The majority of\npatients with confirmed monkeypox reported exposure to wild or exotic\nmammals, including prairie dogs; some patients also had contact with\nother persons with monkeypox virus infection in a household setting.\nNo cases of monkeypox that could be attributed exclusively to\nperson-to-person contact have been confirmed.\nUse of Smallpox Vaccine\nTo prevent further transmission of monkeypox, 28 residents of 6\nstates have received smallpox vaccine since 13 Jun 2003; recipients\nincluded 26 adults and 2 children. Vaccine was administered to 2\nlaboratory workers and 2 health-care workers pre-exposure and to 24\npersons post-exposure (10 health-care workers, 7 household contacts,\n3 laboratory workers, 2 public health veterinarians, one public\nhealth worker, and one work contact). One child vaccinated\npost-exposure had a rash 6 days after vaccination; PCR testing of\nskin lesions from the child was positive for monkeypox virus. The\nchild lived in a household with 2 ill prairie dogs and an adult with\nlaboratory-confirmed monkeypox virus infection. One prairie dog had\nbeen present in the household for approximately 1 year and became ill\nafter the introduction of a second ill prairie dog into the home. The\nchild's period of exposure began 25 days before vaccination, when the\nill prairie dog was brought into the home; the child's rash began 12\ndays after the onset of rash illness in the adult household member.\nAnimal Laboratory Testing\nTraceback investigations have implicated a shipment of animals from\nGhana that was imported to Texas on 9 Apr 2003 as the probable source\nof introduction of monkeypox virus into the United States (1,2). The\nshipment contained approximately 800 small mammals of 9 different\nspecies, including 6 genera of African rodents. These rodent genera\nincluded rope squirrels (Funiscuirus sp.), tree squirrels\n(Heliosciurus sp.), Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys sp.), brushtail\nporcupines (Atherurus sp.), dormice (Graphiurus sp.), and striped\nmice (Hybomys sp.). Gambian rats from this shipment were kept in\nclose proximity to prairie dogs at an Illinois animal vendor\nimplicated in the sale of infected prairie dogs.\nCDC laboratory testing of some animals by using PCR and virus\nisolation demonstrated that one Gambian giant rat, 3 dormice, and 2\nrope squirrels from the 9 Apr 2003 importation were infected with\nmonkeypox virus. Evaluation of other animals associated with the\nshipment is ongoing. Evidence of infection was found in some animals\nthat had been separated from the rest of the shipment on the day of\ntheir arrival into the United States, indicating early and possibly\nwidespread infection among the remaining animals in the shipment. The\nlaboratory investigation confirmed that multiple animal species are\nsusceptible to infection with monkeypox virus.\nCDC had recommended previously that state health officials place\nquarantines on commercial facilities or households that had infected\nanimals or received African rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment (1).\nCDC has issued guidance on the quarantine and euthanasia of all\nrodents from the shipment, as well as prairie dogs that were exposed\nto the imported rodents or other animals with illnesses consistent\nwith the case definition for monkeypox.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/quarantineremoval.htm>\nAnimals that are euthanized according to the guidance should be\nincinerated and not buried in a landfill or backyard setting.\nCDC and the Food and Drug Administration issued a joint order on 11\nJun 2003 prohibiting the importation of any African rodent. In\naddition, the order prohibits the sale and transport within the\nUnited States of prairie dogs and 6 genera of African rodents.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/pdf/embargo.pdf>\nTo prevent the spread of monkeypox virus into domestic or wild animal\npopulations, the order also prohibits releasing any of these animals\ninto the wild. State and local health departments or departments of\nagriculture should be consulted for guidance on the safe disposal of\nanimals. The joint order remains in effect regardless of the actions\nrelated to the guidance for quarantine and euthanasia of animals of\nconcern.\nHealth-care providers, veterinarians, and public-health officials who\nsuspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to\ntheir state and local health departments. State health departments\nshould report suspect cases to CDC, telephone 770-488-7100.

This report updates epidemiologic,\nlaboratory, and smallpox vaccine use data for U.S. cases.\nAs of 25 Jun 2003, a total of 79 cases of monkeypox had been reported to\nCDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (20), Illinois (16), Missouri (2), Kansas\n(one), and Ohio (one); these include 29 cases laboratory-confirmed at CDC\nand 51 cases under investigation by state and local health departments. A\ntotal of 19 cases were excluded from those reported in the previous update\nbecause they met the exclusion criteria outlined in the updated case\ndefinition (2), and 11 were added. Of the 79 cases, 37 (47 percent) were\namong males; the median age was 28 years (range: 1 to 51 years). Age data\nwere unavailable for 2 patients. Among 75 patients for whom data were\navailable, 19 (25 percent) were hospitalized. Two patients have had a\nserious clinical illness. The first patient was a child with a previously\nreported laboratory-confirmed case of severe monkeypox-associated\nencephalitis (1,2); the child subsequently improved and was discharged\nafter requiring hospitalization for 14 days. A second child, who was\nexposed to 3 ill prairie dogs, was hospitalized with profound painful\ncervical and tonsillar adenopathy and diffuse pox lesions, including\nlesions in the oropharynx. Although the child had difficulty breathing and\nswallowing, mechanical ventilation was not required. The adenopathy peaked\n5 days after rash onset and 7 days after onset of initial prodromal\nsymptoms of general malaise, myalgia, and fever. Preliminary testing of\nskin rash lesions was positive for orthopoxvirus infection; confirmatory\ntesting for monkeypox virus is pending at CDC.\nOf the 79 reported cases, 29 (37 percent) have been laboratory confirmed at\nCDC for monkeypox by detection of virus in skin rash lesions by using\nculture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical testing,\nand/or electron microscopy. One patient had monkeypox virus detected by PCR\nand culture in throat and nasopharyngeal swabs obtained when the patient\nwas ill with prodromal symptoms and a macular rash. In addition, an IgM\nresponse to orthopoxvirus antigen was detected in an acute serum sample.\nFor these laboratory-confirmed cases, dates of illness onset ranged from 16\nMay 2003 to 11 Jun 2003. All confirmed patients reported a rash and at\nleast one other clinical sign or symptom, including fever, respiratory\nsymptoms, and/or lymphadenopathy. The median incubation period (i.e., first\nexposure date to illness onset date) was 12 days (range: 2 to 26 days). The\nmajority of confirmed patients reported exposure to wild or exotic mammals,\nincluding prairie dogs; some patients also had contact with other persons\nwith monkeypox virus infection in a household setting. No cases of\nmonkeypox that could be attributed exclusively to person-to-person contact\nhave been confirmed.\nUse of Smallpox Vaccine\n-----------------------\nTo prevent further transmission of monkeypox, 26 residents of 5 states have\nreceived smallpox vaccine since 13 Jun 2003; recipients included 24 adults\nand 2 children. Vaccine was administered to 2 laboratory workers\npre-exposure and to 24 persons post-exposure (11 health-care workers, 7\nhousehold contacts, 3 laboratory workers, 2 public health veterinarians,\nand one work contact). One adult who was vaccinated as a child did not have\na major vaccine reaction or 'take' 7 days after vaccination and required\nrevaccination.\nCDC has issued updated interim guidance on the use of smallpox vaccine,\ncidofovir, and vaccinia immune globulin for prevention and treatment in the\nsetting of an outbreak of monkeypox (3). Principal changes in the updated\nguidance include a revision of the definition of close contact with an ill\nanimal, recommendations for vaccination of clinical laboratory workers\nhandling specimens from ill animals and persons infected with monkeypox\nvirus, and instructions for reporting smallpox vaccine-related serious\nadverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\nHealth-care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who\nsuspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their\nstate and local health departments. State health departments should report\nsuspect cases to CDC, telephone 770-488-7100.

Both confirmed\ncases demonstrated 'significant viremia at the vesiculo-pustular stage of\ndisease, which may indicate a poor prognosis and significant viral\nshedding.' The third patient was one of the first infected. All her\nlesions were already healed when we collected her blood, therefore it makes\nsense that she is no longer shedding virus. These are the first confirmed\ncases of monkeypox in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville).\n\nThe fact that this epidemic is centered at the government hospital among\nclose contacts of health-care staff who have limited exposure to forest\nanimals, but ongoing exposure to patients with active lesions at the\nhospital, underscores the urgent need for administration of smallpox\nvaccine. We will do what we can using barrier methods, waste disposal,\npatient isolation, and ongoing training of staff in universal precautions\n(a misnomer, because the equipment needed for such precautions is not\nuniversally available) to try to prevent the human-to-human transmission\nthat is obviously occurring.\nIn talking with other health-care providers working in the Likouala region,\nit is clear that this disease has likely been present in the Likouala\nRegion for quite some time. This would make sense, given the fact that the\nclimate and living conditions of this inundated tropical rain forest region\nare virtually identical to those of Equateur Province in Democratic\nRepublic of Congo (DRC), which is located just across the Oubangui River\nfrom the Likouala Region in Republic of Congo, where the world's largest\nrecorded outbreak of human monkeypox infection occurred in 1996-97. There\nis significant daily interchange of foodstuffs, bush meat, and persons\nbetween the 2 countries. In fact one of the biggest bulk-food markets in\nImpfondo (district capital of the Likouala Region) is on a no-man's island\nin the middle of the River, located on the border between the 2 countries\n(we call it affectionately 'Market in the Middle'). There are also still\ntens of thousands of refugees from DRC Equateur Province living on the ROC\nbanks of the River. Many people in Impfondo have relatives living on both\nsides of the River. It is not at all uncommon for Congolese from ROC to\nplant gardens (for subsistence farming) in the forest in DRC and vice-versa.\nThis epidemic is not over. An 18 year old female was admitted to the\ngovernment hospital on Tue 24 Jun 2003. We appreciate all of your support\nand encouragement in trying to deal with this epidemic.

Impfondo is the Capital\nof the Likouala Region, which is the northernmost region of the\nRepublic of Congo. Impfondo is located on the western banks of the\nOubangui River, a major tributary of the Congo River. It is\nsurrounded by dense tropical rain forest.\nMonkeypox is known to occur primarily in the rain forest countries of\nCentral and West Africa. People here do have frequent contact with\nforest animals, including monkeys, which are often used as bush-meat.\nVery limited, basic, village, lab facilities do exist in Impfondo,\nbut most of the 'labs' are chronically short on supplies and reagents.\nLast week (I believe it was Sat 14 Jun 2003), while driving through\nImpfondo, I saw an otherwise health-appearing young man (probably in\nhis early 20s) with multiple, widely-disseminated, impressive,\nhealing smallpox-like lesions walking on the sidewalk near Impfondo's\nbiggest market.\nThis evening, Thu 19 June 2003, Dr. Wassa-Wassa, Chief of Medicine\nand Pediatrics at the government hospital in Impfondo stopped by our\nhouse to request my assistance in educating the population about the\nneed for strict isolation procedures to prevent the spread of an\noutbreak of 'variola'. As soon as I heard about this, I went to the\nhospital to examine the patients. I examined 4 patients.\nIn the first private room: (1) An approximately 9-month old baby boy\nwith numerous widely-disseminated, healing, deep-seated, firm,\nwell-circumscribed\nround umbilicated and some coalescing lesions, all at the same stage\nof development. The child was listless, febrile, and had coryza. [I\nhave borrowed some of the descriptive terms from 'Evaluating Patients\nfor Smallpox' information guide Version 1.0: 31 Jan 2002 published by\nCDC, because they describe these cases perfectly]. (2) A 6 year-old\ngirl, (the baby's maternal aunt) with malaise and fever, and the same\nlesions in an earlier stage, more vesicle-like. (3) The 16 year-old\nmother of the baby (and older sister to patient #2) who had recovered\nfrom a similar illness, showing only rare, healed lesions. The mother\nreported that the index case was her 12-year old brother, who had\nalready been discharged from the hospital.\nIn a separate private room: (4) A 4 year-old boy (unrelated to the\nother patients, but living on the same hospital compound) with fewer\nsmaller, papular, widely-disseminated, firm, well-circumscribed round\nlesions. According to his mother, his illness began with a febrile\nprodrome 5 days ago, followed by the lesions 2 days ago. He has\nsignificant lymphadenopathy with a 3 cm node in the right anterior\ncervical region, and significant rhinorrhea and some cough. No\nhepatosplenomegaly. His father is the head nurse for the medical\nward, and they live on the hospital compound. His 10-year old\nsister died last week of a similar illness.\nI should note that the nurse on call who showed us to the patients'\nrooms did not have access to examination gloves, masks, protective\ngowns, goggles or face shields, running water, soap, bleach, or\nalcohol. The first room had no lights. The patients were being fed\nand attended to by several unprotected family members. Apparently the\nindex case (the younger brother of patient #3) was a 12-year old boy\nwho had traveled to a village 12 kms outside of Impfondo for Easter\nvacation. He got sick on 15 Apr 2003, and was hospitalized after\nreturning to Impfondo. He has since been discharged from the\nhospital. He lives on the hospital compound in the same house with\npatients 1, 2 and 3. His father is the physician's assistant in\ncharge of medicine and pediatrics. I was told by family members and\nhospital staff that there have been 10 cases, with one 10 year old\nchild who died last week. All of the cases treated at the hospital\nseem to be family members or close contacts of hospital staff that\nlive on the hospital compound.\nAfter examining the patients, I interviewed some of the staff\nmembers. Dr.Wassa-Wassa was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful.\nHe had taken photos of several patients, and sent them to his\nsuperiors in Brazzaville, trying to sound the alarm. Apparently the\nreply was that this must be varicella [chickenpox], because variola\n[smallox] had been eradicated years ago. I believe we are most likely\ndealing with a monkeypox outbreak (it is definitely not chickenpox),\nbut we can't be sure without viral laboratory studies which are\nunavailable in this region. I feel strongly that positive\nidentification of the causative agent should be pursued in a timely\nfashion. I would like to rule out smallpox, since people in this area\nhaven't been vaccinated in years, and given the high threat of\ninternational bioterrorism. If smallpox were to reoccur someday, or\nif it has remained undetected since 1977, it would probably show up\nin someplace like the Likouala Region, one of the most isolated spots\non earth.\nIt is clear that person-to-person spread of this infection is continuing to\noccur. Also, immediate measures need to be taken to prevent the spread of\nthis disease. These would include the institution of general infection\ncontrol precautions; e.g. according to the CDC Health Advisory (contained in\nHealth Alert Priority #44, dated 9 Jun 2003, from NY County of Erie\nDepartment of Health, Anthony J. Billittier IV, MD, FACEP,\nCommissioner of Health). I am planning to obtain serum and vesicular\nfluid samples from the active cases, and send them on the plane to\nBrazzaville tomorrow morning [Fri 20 Jun 2003].\n--\nJoseph M.

This\nreport updates results of the epidemiologic investigation, provides\ninformation on the use of smallpox vaccine during the outbreak, and\nsummarizes the animal tracing activities to identify the origin and\nsubsequent distribution of infected animals.\nEpidemiologic Investigation\n---------------------------\nAs of Tue 8 Jul 2003, a total of 71 cases of monkeypox have been reported\nto CDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (16), Illinois (12), Missouri (2),\nKansas (one), and Ohio (one); these include 35 (49 percent) cases\nlaboratory-confirmed at CDC and 36 (51 percent) suspect and probable cases\nunder investigation by state and local health departments. 11 cases were\nexcluded from those reported previously because they met the exclusion\ncriteria outlined in the updated national case definition, and one new case\nwas added (1). The number of cases increased from 15 May 2003 through the\nweek ending 8 Jun 2003 and declined subsequently; the date of onset for the\nlast case was 20 Jun 2003.\nOf the 71 cases, 39 (55 percent) occurred among females; the median age was\n28 years (range: 1 to 51 years). Age data were unavailable for one patient.\nAmong 69 patients for whom data were available, 18 (26 percent) were\nhospitalized; some patients were hospitalized for isolation precautions\nonly. 2 patients, both children, had serious clinical illness (1, 2, 3, 4);\nboth of these patients have recovered. The majority of patients were\nexposed to prairie dogs. Some patients were exposed in premises where\nprairie dogs were kept, and others were exposed to persons with monkeypox.\nNo patients have been confirmed to have had exposure to persons with\nmonkeypox as their only possible exposure.\nOf the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases, 32 (91 percent) tested positive for\nmonkeypox by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, immunohistochemical\ntesting (IHC), and/or electron microscopy in skin rash lesions; two tested\npositive by PCR and/or culture of an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab;\nand one tested positive by PCR and culture of a lymph node aspirate. For\nlaboratory-confirmed cases, onset of illness ranged from 16 May to 20 Jun\n2003. The majority of patients reported a clinical illness that included\nrash (one patient had a single, atypical plaque-like skin lesion) and\nfever. The median incubation period* was 12 days (range: 1 to 31 days).\nUse of Smallpox Vaccine\n-----------------------\nTo prevent transmission of monkeypox, 30 persons (28 adults and 2 children)\nin 6 states have received smallpox vaccine since 13 Jun 2003. Vaccine was\nadministered pre-exposure to 7 persons (3 veterinarians, 2 laboratory\nworkers, and 2 health-care workers) and post-exposure to 23 persons (10\nhealth-care workers, 7 household contacts, 3 laboratory workers, one public\nhealth veterinarian, one public health epidemiologist, and one work\ncontact). No serious adverse events were reported following smallpox\nvaccination, and no requests for vaccinia immune globulin have been\nreceived. Among the 30 persons who received smallpox vaccine, 3 (10\npercent) reported rash within 2 weeks of vaccination. One of the 3 was\nconfirmed as having monkeypox; another person had 2 skin lesion specimens\nthat tested negative for orthopoxvirus and varicella zoster virus at the\nstate health laboratory; no specimens were obtained for the third person\nwho reported a single, dime-sized, pruritic and erythematous skin lesion\n(not pustular) remote from the vaccination site that appeared 4 days after\nvaccination and faded within a week.\nAnimal Traceback and Trace-Forward Investigations\n------------------------------------------------\nTraceback investigations have determined that all 35 confirmed human cases\nof monkeypox were associated with prairie dogs obtained from an Illinois\nanimal distributor (IL-1), or from animal distributors who purchased\nprairie dogs from IL-1 [The text is accompanied by an excellent diagram\nwhich cannot be reproduced here, but should be consulted for better\nappreciation of the situation. - Mod.CP]. Traceback of animal exposures are\nongoing for other cases. Prairie dogs at IL-1 appear to have been infected\nthrough contact with Gambian giant rats and dormice that originated in\nGhana and were purchased on 21 Apr 2003 by IL-1. Approximately 200 prairie\ndogs had been at the IL-1 facility during the period April to May; an\nunspecified number overlapped with the arrival of the imported African\nrodents on 21 Apr 2003 and probably were exposed to monkeypox. A total of\n93 infected or potentially infected prairie dogs were traced from IL-1 to 6\nstates; in addition, an unknown number of prairie dogs died or were\nreportedly sold (as pets for sale or exchange) at animal swap meets for\nwhich no records were available for tracing. At CDC, laboratory testing of\n4 prairie dogs originating from IL-1 confirmed the presence of monkeypox\nvirus by PCR and IHC.\nTraceback investigations to identify the source of introduction of\nmonkeypox into the United States identified a Texas animal distributor\n(TX-1) that had imported a shipment of approximately 800 small mammals from\nGhana on 9 Apr 2003 that contained 762 African rodents, including rope\nsquirrels (_Funiscuirus_ sp.), tree squirrels (_Heliosciurus_ sp.), Gambian\ngiant rats (_Cricetomys_ sp.), brushtail porcupines (_Atherurus_ sp.),\ndormice (_Graphiurus_ sp.), and striped mice (_Hybomys_ sp.). CDC\nlaboratory testing of some animals from this shipment confirmed the\npresence of monkeypox by PCR and virus isolation in several rodent species,\nincluding one Gambian rat, 3 dormice, and 2 rope squirrels (1).\nTrace-forward investigations of the rodents on the shipment were initiated\nbefore the availability of laboratory results because of concerns that\nanimals were a potential source of continued spread of monkeypox. Of the\n762 rodents from the original shipment, 584 (77 percent) have been traced\nto distributors in 6 states. A total of 178 (23 percent) African rodents\ncould not be traced beyond the point of entry in Texas because records were\nnot available. No suspect, probable, or confirmed cases of human monkeypox\nhave been associated with direct contact with the African rodents from the\n9 Apr 2003 shipment. In addition, other than the prairie dogs traced from\nIL-1 to subsequent sites, no cases of monkeypox in other animals that had\ncontact with the African rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment have been\nreported.\n(Reported by: State and local health departments. Monkeypox investigation\nteam, CDC.)\nMMWR Editorial Note\n-------------------\nThe outbreak described in this report highlights the public health threat\nposed by importation, for commercial purposes, of exotic pets into the\nUnited States. Epidemiologic and animal traceback investigations confirm\nthat the first community-acquired human cases of monkeypox in the United\nStates resulted from contact with infected prairie dogs that had been\nhoused or transported with African rodents imported from Ghana.\nImported, exotic wild animals can carry non-indigenous, zoonotic pathogens,\nwhich can spread rapidly among indigenous susceptible animal populations in\nthe United States, particularly when mixed together in close proximity. In\naddition, inter-species exchange of pathogens is possible because of close\nrelations between humans and their pets. In this outbreak, the rapid and\nwidespread distribution of monkeypox-infected and potentially infected\nimported wild animals to distributors and potential buyers in several\nsettings (e.g., pet stores, swap meets, and wild animal trade centers) in\nthe United States and to other countries enabled epizootic spread through\nmultiple states before effective interventions could be implemented.\nPublic health strategies to control this outbreak, including the Food and\nDrug Administration-CDC joint order banning importation and prohibiting\nmovement of the implicated animal species, state-enacted measures to\nfurther restrict intrastate animal shipment and trade (4), premise\nquarantine, and animal euthanasia, appear to have been effective in\nreducing exposure of humans to infected animals, with few cases reported\nsince its implementation on 11 Jun 2003. Additional control measures have\nincluded pre- and post-exposure vaccination of potentially exposed persons\nwith smallpox vaccine (5).\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/pdf/embargo.pdf>)\nLaboratory tests have demonstrated the presence of monkeypox virus in\nseveral rodents from the original shipment from Ghana that died\nunexpectedly and did not exhibit characteristic signs of monkeypox in\nanimals (e.g., conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions). For this\nreason, CDC guidance for premise quarantine and animal euthanasia is based\non the possibility that infected rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment could\nbe asymptomatic, shed virus, and potentially cause infection in other\nsusceptible animals or humans.\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/quarantineremoval.htm>)\nAlthough no human monkeypox cases have been associated with contact with\nrodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment, these animals are considered to pose\na continued risk for infection for other animals and humans. Euthanasia,\nfollowing American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines, is\nrecommended for all rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment and for any\nprairie dogs that were on the premises at the same time as any of the\nAfrican rodents.\n(<http://www.avma.org/noah/members/policy/default.asp>)\nIn addition, mammals in facilities that housed a rodent from the 9 Apr 2003\nshipment should be placed under quarantine for 6 weeks following the last\ndate a rodent of concern was present. Efforts are underway to collect\nadditional epidemiologic and laboratory data on both human and animal cases\nand their contacts, including animal handlers who might have been exposed\nto infected rodents.\nImportation of exotic animals and indigenous, wild animals harvested for\nthe commercial pet trade have been associated with previous outbreaks of\ninfectious diseases in humans, including salmonella associated with\nreptiles (e.g., lizards, snakes, and turtles) and tularemia associated with\nprairie dogs (6, 7); prairie dogs also have been documented to be infected\nwith other human pathogens (e.g., plague) (8). The Institute of Medicine\nrecently highlighted the role of international travel and commerce in the\nemergence of infectious diseases through the dissemination of pathogens and\ntheir vectors throughout the world (9). CDC and other federal agencies, in\ncollaboration with state and local health departments and professional\norganizations, are developing long-term strategies to coordinate the\ncontrol of importation, exportation, interstate trade, and intrastate sale\nof exotic and native wild animals (10).\nHealth-care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who\nsuspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their\nstate and local health departments. State health departments should report\nsuspect cases to CDC, telephone 770-488-7100. An updated case definition\nwith revised case exclusion criteria is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/index.htm>. Rash illnesses suspected\nto be monkeypox should be confirmed by laboratory evaluation. Clinical\nspecimens should be submitted for testing after consultation with the state\nand local health departments. Protocols for specimen collection, including\ncompletion of specimen submission forms, should follow CDC guidance\navailable at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/diagspecimens.htm>.\nBecause information included in the specimen-submission and case-reporting\nforms is essential for accurate interpretation of laboratory results, these\nforms should be completed by state health departments. Preferred specimens\nfor testing are those from skin lesions. Because smallpox vaccine might\nmodify monkeypox disease, evaluation of any rash post-vaccination in a\nperson exposed to monkeypox should include laboratory testing for monkeypox\nvirus.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Traceback investigations to identify the source of introduction of\nmonkeypox into the United States identified a Texas animal distributor\n(TX-1) that had imported a shipment of approximately 800 small mammals from\nGhana on 9 Apr 2003 that contained 762 African rodents, including rope\nsquirrels (_Funiscuirus_ sp.), tree squirrels (_Heliosciurus_ sp.), Gambian\ngiant rats (_Cricetomys_ sp.), brushtail porcupines (_Atherurus_ sp.),\ndormice (_Graphiurus_ sp.), and striped mice (_Hybomys_ sp.). One of the 3 was\nconfirmed as having monkeypox; another person had 2 skin lesion specimens\nthat tested negative for orthopoxvirus and varicella zoster virus at the\nstate health laboratory; no specimens were obtained for the third person\nwho reported a single, dime-sized, pruritic and erythematous skin lesion\n(not pustular) remote from the vaccination site that appeared 4 days after\nvaccination and faded within a week. Vaccine was\nadministered pre-exposure to 7 persons (3 veterinarians, 2 laboratory\nworkers, and 2 health-care workers) and post-exposure to 23 persons (10\nhealth-care workers, 7 household contacts, 3 laboratory workers, one public\nhealth veterinarian, one public health epidemiologist, and one work\ncontact). Importation of exotic animals and indigenous, wild animals harvested for\nthe commercial pet trade have been associated with previous outbreaks of\ninfectious diseases in humans, including salmonella associated with\nreptiles (e.g., lizards, snakes, and turtles) and tularemia associated with\nprairie dogs (6, 7); prairie dogs also have been documented to be infected\nwith other human pathogens (e.g., plague) (8). In this outbreak, the rapid and\nwidespread distribution of monkeypox-infected and potentially infected\nimported wild animals to distributors and potential buyers in several\nsettings (e.g., pet stores, swap meets, and wild animal trade centers) in\nthe United States and to other countries enabled epizootic spread through\nmultiple states before effective interventions could be implemented. For this\nreason, CDC guidance for premise quarantine and animal euthanasia is based\non the possibility that infected rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment could\nbe asymptomatic, shed virus, and potentially cause infection in other\nsusceptible animals or humans.\n Euthanasia,\nfollowing American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines, is\nrecommended for all rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment and for any\nprairie dogs that were on the premises at the same time as any of the\nAfrican rodents.\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n As of Tue 8 Jul 2003, a total of 71 cases of monkeypox have been reported\nto CDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (16), Illinois (12), Missouri (2),\nKansas (one), and Ohio (one); these include 35 (49 percent) cases\nlaboratory-confirmed at CDC and 36 (51 percent) suspect and probable cases\nunder investigation by state and local health departments. In addition, other than the prairie dogs traced from\nIL-1 to subsequent sites, no cases of monkeypox in other animals that had\ncontact with the African rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment have been\nreported.\n Of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases, 32 (91 percent) tested positive for\nmonkeypox by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, immunohistochemical\ntesting (IHC), and/or electron microscopy in skin rash lesions; two tested\npositive by PCR and/or culture of an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab;\nand one tested positive by PCR and culture of a lymph node aspirate. A total of\n93 infected or potentially infected prairie dogs were traced from IL-1 to 6\nstates; in addition, an unknown number of prairie dogs died or were\nreportedly sold (as pets for sale or exchange) at animal swap meets for\nwhich no records were available for tracing. CDC and other federal agencies, in\ncollaboration with state and local health departments and professional\norganizations, are developing long-term strategies to coordinate the\ncontrol of importation, exportation, interstate trade, and intrastate sale\nof exotic and native wild animals (10). This\nreport updates results of the epidemiologic investigation, provides\ninformation on the use of smallpox vaccine during the outbreak, and\nsummarizes the animal tracing activities to identify the origin and\nsubsequent distribution of infected animals. ------------------------------------------------\nCDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate cases of\nmonkeypox among persons in the United States who had contact with wild or\nexotic mammalian pets or with persons with monkeypox (1, 2, 3, 4). Traceback investigations have determined that all 35 confirmed human cases\nof monkeypox were associated with prairie dogs obtained from an Illinois\nanimal distributor (IL-1), or from animal distributors who purchased\nprairie dogs from IL-1 \nHealth-care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who\nsuspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their\nstate and local health departments. Because smallpox vaccine might\nmodify monkeypox disease, evaluation of any rash post-vaccination in a\nperson exposed to monkeypox should include laboratory testing for monkeypox\nvirus.

CDC\nlaboratory testing of some animals from this shipment confirmed the\npresence of monkeypox by PCR and virus isolation in several rodent species,\nincluding one Gambian rat, 3 dormice, and 2 rope squirrels (1). Approximately 200 prairie\ndogs had been at the IL-1 facility during the period April to May; an\nunspecified number overlapped with the arrival of the imported African\nrodents on 21 Apr 2003 and probably were exposed to monkeypox. Efforts are underway to collect\nadditional epidemiologic and laboratory data on both human and animal cases\nand their contacts, including animal handlers who might have been exposed\nto infected rodents.

Although no human monkeypox cases have been associated with contact with\nrodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment, these animals are considered to pose\na continued risk for infection for other animals and humans. No suspect, probable, or confirmed cases of human monkeypox\nhave been associated with direct contact with the African rodents from the\n9 Apr 2003 shipment. The number of cases increased from 15 May 2003 through the\nweek ending 8 Jun 2003 and declined subsequently; the date of onset for the\nlast case was 20 Jun 2003. Trace-forward investigations of the rodents on the shipment were initiated\nbefore the availability of laboratory results because of concerns that\nanimals were a potential source of continued spread of monkeypox. At CDC, laboratory testing of\n4 prairie dogs originating from IL-1 confirmed the presence of monkeypox\nvirus by PCR and IHC. Some patients were exposed in premises where\nprairie dogs were kept, and others were exposed to persons with monkeypox.\n Prairie dogs at IL-1 appear to have been infected\nthrough contact with Gambian giant rats and dormice that originated in\nGhana and were purchased on 21 Apr 2003 by IL-1. In addition, mammals in facilities that housed a rodent from the 9 Apr 2003\nshipment should be placed under quarantine for 6 weeks following the last\ndate a rodent of concern was present. For\nlaboratory-confirmed cases, onset of illness ranged from 16 May to 20 Jun\n2003.

Only zoos and research\nlaboratories will be permitted to bring in these animals under the\ngovernor's executive order, which also requires the state Agriculture\nDepartment to quarantine any potential source of the unusual viral disease.\nThe state Department for Public Health announced that 3 members of a\nWestern Kentucky household had developed rashes, fever, and cold-like\nsymptoms after exposure to prairie dogs from a Paducah pet store. The 3,\nand 2 other family members who also came into contact with the animals,\nhave agreed to remain isolated at home, pending the outcome of tests by the\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nKentucky's first suspected case of monkeypox, reported on Fri 13 Jun 2003,\nwas a woman who had handled prairie dogs in the same pet store. The store\nhad received degus [a rodent similar to the chinchilla] and squirrels \u0097-\nbut not prairie dogs \u0097- from a pet supplier in Illinois. Infected prairie\ndogs from the Illinois supplier have been linked to an outbreak of\nmonkeypox in the Midwest \u0097- the first known cases in the western\nhemisphere. The prairie dogs were apparently infected at the Illinois\nsupplier by a Gambian giant rat that had been imported from Africa, where\nmonkeypox was first identified in 1970.\nThe disease is related to smallpox and causes similar rashes and blisters,\nbut it is less serious and less easily spread. None of the 12 confirmed US\ncases \u0097- four each in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin \u0097- has been fatal.\nAs of noon yesterday, CDC reported that 82 cases were being investigated in\nIllinois, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, but the suspected cases\nin Kentucky are not included in that total. Like the initial suspected case\n[in Kentucky], the new ones are not serious, said Gwenda Bond, a\nspokeswoman for the Cabinet for Health Services. She said there were two\npossible sources of exposure in the new cases: family members had contact\nwith prairie dogs at the pet store and with a neighbor's prairie dog that\nwas purchased at the pet store. Bond said neither the neighbor's prairie\ndog nor any of the 11 others sold by the store since it opened last month\nhave shown signs of illness. Denise Marshall, the store's owner, said that,\ndespite publicity about monkeypox, customers are still coming in asking to\nbuy prairie dogs, which have become a popular pet.\nThe governor's executive order prohibits the importation of rodents,\nrabbits, and primates for distribution to the public. The ban is more\nfar-reaching than one issued last week by the Department of Fish and\nWildlife Resources, which applied only to non-domesticated animals. The\norder also requires the Agriculture Department to quarantine any potential\nsource of monkeypox until suspect animals have been either isolated or\neuthanized, and the site has been cleaned and disinfected under the\ndepartment's supervision. The order gives the animal owner the option of\nisolating the animals for 30 days or surrendering them to the Agriculture\nDepartment or the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. The governor\nalso authorized the Department for Public Health to 'take any and all\nappropriate measures' if a human case of monkeypox is confirmed in Kentucky.\nAgriculture officials balked last week at issuing a quarantine on the\nPaducah pet store, which had been requested by Fish and Wildlife, but the\ngovernor's order, which followed a meeting yesterday among officials of the\n3 agencies involved, appears to have resolved the dispute. Bond said the\norder clarifies the agencies' roles. 'This is such a unique situation, and\nthere are a lot of overlapping powers,' she said. Agriculture officials\ncould not be reached late yesterday, and it was unclear whether the agency\nhad taken any steps to implement the quarantine.\n(byline: Gideon Gil)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It is not clear from this report whether the prairie dogs, the humans, or\nboth, are being tested for presence of monkeypox virus.

This report updates epidemiological, laboratory, and animal\ndata for US cases.\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nAs of 18 Jun 2003, a total of 87 cases of monkeypox have been reported to\nCDC from Wisconsin (38), Indiana (24), Illinois (19), Ohio (4), Kansas (1),\nand Missouri (1). Of the 87 cases, 41 were males. The median age for the 82\npatients for whom age data were available was 28 years (range: 1 to 55\nyears). Data on symptom onset were available for 78 persons [shown\ngraphically in the original report]).\nAmong the 75 patients for whom data were available, 20 were admitted to\nhospital. The majority of patients were not seriously ill; some were\nadmitted to facilitate proper isolation.\nTwenty cases were laboratory confirmed at CDC [data tabulated in the\noriginal report]. Among these 20, one was a child admitted to hospital with\nsevere encephalitis 3 days after developing a vesicular rash, which was\noriginally thought to be varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Diagnostic testing\nfor VZV and for herpes simplex virus in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and\nskin lesion biopsy was negative. A skin lesion biopsy was positive for\nmonkeypox DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for orthopox antigens\nby immunohistochemical (IHC) testing.\nThe majority of patients had direct or close contact with wild or exotic\nmammals such as prairie dogs (_Cynomys_ sp.). In one instance, 28 children\nattending a day care facility in Indiana were potentially exposed to 2\nprairie dogs that subsequently became ill and died; 12 reported handling or\npetting the prairie dogs, and 7 subsequently became ill with symptoms\nconsistent with monkeypox infection. Laboratory evaluation of these\nchildren is in progress.\nLaboratory investigation\n------------------------\nClinical specimens obtained from 82 patients in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,\nand Wisconsin were forwarded to CDC for testing. Twenty of 27 patients with\nskin rash-lesion specimens were laboratory confirmed for monkeypox by viral\nisolation, PCR, electron microscopy, and/or IHC; four were negative for\nmonkeypox virus; one patient was found to have varicella by PCR testing;\nand 2 are pending. Two health care workers in Wisconsin who were suspected\ninitially of acquiring disease by human-to-human transmission had no\nevidence of monkeypox-specific DNA signatures in blood and nasopharyngeal\nand/or oropharyngeal swabs; culture results are pending. These people did\nnot have a rash, and IgM testing has not revealed any anti-orthopoxvirus\nimmune reactivity.\nAnimal investigation\n--------------------\nTraceback investigations of animals are ongoing to identify how monkeypox\nvirus was introduced into the US. Preliminary results have determined that\nan animal vendor in Wisconsin (distributor A) sold prairie dogs to the\nindex patient in Wisconsin; this vendor had obtained prairie dogs from an\nanimal vendor in Illinois (distributor B), who had housed prairie dogs and\nGambian giant rats (_Cricetomys_ sp.) in close proximity.\nBecause Gambian giant rats often are imported from regions of Africa where\nmonkeypox is endemic, traceback investigations of the Gambian giant rats\nwere initiated. These investigations identified a shipment of animals from\nGhana, including Gambian giant rats that were delivered to a Texas animal\nimporter (distributor C) on 9 Apr 2003.

Now National Public Radio (NPR) has learned that Wisconsin\nofficials are investigating at least 3 possible cases of human-to-human\ninfection. If confirmed, experts say the cases will pose new challenges for\npublic health.\nFrom experience in Africa, where monkeypox sometimes causes epidemics,\nexperts in infectious disease already knew that monkeypox can be transmitted\nfrom one person to another. But they hoped it would be mainly an animal-to-\nhuman disease in this country. Yesterday there were signs they may be\ndisappointed. Dr. John Melski of Wisconsin's Marshfield Clinic says the very\nfirst American case of monkeypox -- a 4-year-old child -- may have infected\none of her caregivers. 'A medical assistant at the Mansfield Clinic who acts\nvery much like a nurse had contact with the index case, the young child, long\nbefore we knew what disease she had. But she did have direct contact and did\nhold the child on 22 May 2003. 19 days later -- this Tuesday -- the medical\nassistant developed chills, sweats and fatigue. The next day, one of her\nclose contacts got sick too. Her boyfriend on the 11 Jun 2003 had some\ngeneralized aches and pains and experienced shaking chills with sweats. And\nhe has approximately 6 skin lesions.' Neither case has been confirmed yet as\nmonkeypox.\nMeanwhile, a nurse in Milwaukee came down with flu-like symptoms and a rash\nafter caring for a pet distributor with suspected monkeypox.\nThe cases are under investigation by state and federal health authorities.\nDr. David Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), said that: 'We know that human-to-human spread can occur.\nBut it's not the most efficient method of transmission. Monkeypox can be\nspread by direct contact with body fluids, an infected person, or virus\ncontaminated objects such as beds or clothing.' Dr. Daigle stated that the\nCDC had already warned health care workers to treat suspected monkeypox cases\nas though they were dangerously infectious. But the Milwaukee nurse\nreportedly wore a mask, gloves and gown when she treated the pet dealer.\nMelski says he and his colleagues are debating whether they should get\nsmallpox vaccine to reduce their risk of monkeypox. The CDC has advised\nvaccination for health care workers who have 'unprotected contact' with\npossible cases. Melski said that: 'We need to know the details of what\nexactly unprotected contact means. Does it mean you breathed the same air\nthat the patient breathed? How close? Same hall? Same room? Or does it mean\ncontact with body fluids -- which to the best of my knowledge makes the most\nsense from what we know so far. But obviously no one knows all of the\nanswers.'\n--\nRichard Knox\n<RKnox@npr.org>\n[The evidence for human-to-human transmission of monkepox in the USA is still\ncircumstantial and confirmation of its reality must await the outcome of\nlaboratory diagnostic test. - Mod.CP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: 'Douglas E Docherty' <doug_docherty@usgs.gov>\nComments and Questions\n----------------------\nI followed with great interest the ProMED-mail posts on the outbreak of\nmonkeypox in the Midwest. I am concerned with both the human and North\nAmerican wildlife potential of this virus. After reading the posts I have\nthe following comments and questions about the information presented, and\nwould greatly appreciate it if someone currently close to these cases could\naddress them.\n1. Has it been determined that the Gambian giant rat ('which apparently\ncarried the virus') had monkeypox, or was it assumed to be the source because\nof its African origin? If it is not determined to be the source, perhaps the\nvirus came from somewhere else along the prairie dog 'pipeline' to the\ndistributor/pet owner.\n2. Were the carcasses of the prairie dogs that the distributor\nvoluntarily 'put to death' disposed of in a way that would make the virus non-\ninfectious to any rodents that might investigate or consume those carcasses?\n3. Poxviruses in general are very persistent in the environment. Were the\ncages, toys, bedding, or whatever the infected prairie dogs came in contact\nwith, decontaminated? If not, these contaminated items could be a source of\nmonkeypox virus infection in the future. This applies to any of these\npossibly contaminated items on the premises of the distributor or in the pet\nowner's homes.\n--\nDouglas Docherty\nDiagnostic Virologist\nUSGS, National Wildlife Health Center\n6006 Schroeder Road\nMadison, WI 53711\n<doug_docherty@usgs.gov>\n[As far as I am aware it has not been confirmed that a sick Gambian rat was\nthe origin of the outbreak, although this is very likely as these animals are\nknown to carry the virus, often without overt signs of disease. Nor can I\nanswer Dr. Docherty's other questions. Whatever the origin of the infection,\nit is clear that North American rodents (ground squirrels at least) are\nsusceptible to the virus, and there is a risk that the virus could become\nestablished in wildlife in the USA if there was any lapse in disease control.\nInformed answers to Dr. Docherty's questions would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]\n[see also;\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (WI, IL, IN) 20030608.1412\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(02) 20030609.1422\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(03) 20030610.1433\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(04) 20030611.1436\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(05) 20030611.1443\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (06) 20030612.1450\nMonkeypox - USA: recommendations for vets 20030612.1446\nMonkeypox - USA: recommendations for vets (02) 20030613.1457\n2002\n-----\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (07) 20021025.5638\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) 20020228.3654\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (06) 20020410.3926\n2001\n----\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur) (02) 20010927.2353\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur): RFI 20010315.0523\n2000\n----\nMonkeypox - Congo, Dem.

[As far as I am aware it has not been confirmed that a sick Gambian rat was\nthe origin of the outbreak, although this is very likely as these animals are\nknown to carry the virus, often without overt signs of disease. Has it been determined that the Gambian giant rat ('which apparently\ncarried the virus') had monkeypox, or was it assumed to be the source because\nof its African origin? Were the\ncages, toys, bedding, or whatever the infected prairie dogs came in contact\nwith, decontaminated? A medical assistant at the Mansfield Clinic who acts\nvery much like a nurse had contact with the index case, the young child, long\nbefore we knew what disease she had. Or does it mean\ncontact with body fluids -- which to the best of my knowledge makes the most\nsense from what we know so far. The CDC has advised\nvaccination for health care workers who have 'unprotected contact' with\npossible cases.

In northwest Missouri, the 38-year-old\nvictim bought a prairie dog from Phil's Pocket Pets, in Villa Park, Illinois,\nwhere a number of other infected prairie dogs were sold, said Mary Menges,\nadministrator for communicable diseases at Missouri's Department of Health\nand Senior Services. 'His prairie dog became ill and died; then he became\nill,' Menges said. The man's symptoms were typical of monkeypox, she said,\nand included fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and pustules. The man,\nwho has not been identified publicly, has agreed to remain isolated in his\nhome, and 'he is doing quite well,' Menges said. The man will remain isolated\nuntil his symptoms are gone and the monkeypox scabs have fallen off, which\ncould take 2-3 weeks, she said. Tissue samples taken from the man have been\nsent to the CDC in Atlanta for confirmation, 'but on our preliminary test it\nwas positive,' she said.\nOn Sat 14 Jun 2003, the CDC issued new case numbers for the disease. As of\nSaturday morning, before the Missouri case was reported, 79 cases were being\ninvestigated, 17 of them confirmed, said CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben. They\ninclude: 34 in Wisconsin, 17 in Illinois, 26 in Indiana and 2 in Ohio, she\nsaid.\nMonkeypox symptoms include chills and cough, followed by a rash and sometimes\ndiarrhea, sore throat and mouth sores. Because the symptoms are so common,\nmonkeypox is easily confused with other illnesses.\nAbout 16 children at a day care center in Adams County, Indiana, as well as\nthe woman who runs the center, are among suspected cases of monkeypox in that\nstate, said Dr. Brian Zurcher, a health officer for Adams County. The owner's\ndaughter has been hospitalized and is 'extremely ill,' he said. None of the\nother children was hospitalized, and all have recovered, he said. The family\nthat owns the center had bought 2 prairie dogs that had come from the\ncontaminated group, and used them to entertain and teach the 18 children\nenrolled there, he said. He would not identify the center. 'About 80 percent\nof the children in the day care had some signs or symptoms consistent with\nmonkeypox,' Zurcher said. Specimens from the children have been sent to the\nCDC.\nThe monkeypox outbreak is believed to have begun with a shipment of more than\n800 rodents, including 50 Gambian giant pouched rats, from Africa to a\ndistributor in Texas. The rats are believed to have passed the disease to the\nprairie dogs, which were then sold or traded in the Midwest.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 15 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times, Sat 14 Jun 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/national/14POX.html>\n\nWisconsin: One Prairie Dog Has Played Critical Role in Transmission\n----------------------------------------------\nContact with one prairie dog has accounted for more than half of the 34 human\ncases of monkeypox in Wisconsin, a state health official said on Fri 13 Jun\n2003. The people affected in 18 cases in Wisconsin -- 3 confirmed, 6 probable\nand 9 suspected -- were exposed to the prairie dog as it was moved from place\nto place, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Davis, the Wisconsin state epidemiologist. 'The\nprairie dog was moved quite a bit from a pet store to a household to one\nveterinary clinic and then to a second veterinary clinic before it died,' Dr.\nDavis said.\nThe virus that causes monkeypox is usually transmitted by contact with\nlesions on the skin. But federal health officials have recommended that\nhealth care workers use protections against the possibility of airborne\ntransmission. Wisconsin officials said that in a small number of cases those\nwho got the virus from an animal did not appear to have had direct contact\nwith that animal. One Wisconsin resident who apparently caught monkeypox from\nthe prairie dog had 'minimal' contact with the infected animal but slept in\nthe same room as the caged animal, Dr. Davis said. Also, 'a substantial\nnumber of individuals in one particular veterinary clinic became ill as a\nresult of' direct contact, Dr. Davis said. 'We are trying to understand what\nthat all means, precisely what the contact was. There certainly was a lot of\ntransmission associated with the movement of this animal from place to place\nand with contact with this animal, once the animal was in those settings,'\nDr. Davis said.\nEpidemiologists are tracing prairie dogs and other animals that were sold or\ntraded in the Upper Midwest as part of an investigation into the first ever\noutbreak of monkeypox in the Americas. At least 51 additional human\nmonkeypox cases are under investigation in 3 other states in the\noutbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said.\nThey include 33 in Indiana, 17 in Illinois and 1 in New Jersey [The New\nJersey Case has been discounted; the patient has chickenpox -- see ref. (08)\nbelow. - Mod.CP].\nThe number of cases under investigation in Wisconsin rose by 13 yesterday,\npartly as a result of the publicity that health officials are seeking in\nencouraging people to report any suspected illness. Of the 34 cases under\ninvestigation in Wisconsin, 14 occurred in veterinarians or veterinary\ntechnicians; 8 in exposure to animals in pet stores; 7 in people who had\ncontact with prairie dogs in a household; 3 who may have had exposure to\nprairie dogs in households other than their own; and 2 in health care\nworkers. Tests are pending on 3 suspected cases in which human-to-human\ntransmission of monkeypox may have occurred. Dr. Davis said it appeared\nunlikely that those cases would turn out to be monkeypox.\nSome suspected cases have arisen from people who visited pet stores where\ninfected animals had been housed. In one case, Dr. Davis said, a customer\nvisited a pet store for a substantial amount of time to buy a reptile. It is\nnot clear whether the customer handled an infected animal in the store. In\nanother case, a customer visited a pet store and did not have any contact\nwith prairie dogs, but had been scratched by another animal.\n[By: Larry Altman and Jo Napolitano]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "Of the 34 cases under\ninvestigation in Wisconsin, 14 occurred in veterinarians or veterinary\ntechnicians; 8 in exposure to animals in pet stores; 7 in people who had\ncontact with prairie dogs in a household; 3 who may have had exposure to\nprairie dogs in households other than their own; and 2 in health care\nworkers.

In humans, the\nillness produces a vesicular and pustular rash similar to that produced by\nsmallpox.\n\nThe incubation period from exposure to fever onset is about 12 days. In\nhumans, case-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1 to 10 percent\n(for additional information about monkeypox, see\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutin.htm>).\n\nThese interim guidelines will be updated as new information becomes\navailable and after consultation with additional public health partners.\n\nIn the current outbreak, illness in animals has been reported to include\nfever, cough, blepharoconjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, followed by a\nnodular rash. Some animals have died while others reportedly recovered.\n\nThe types of animals that may become ill with monkeypox are currently\nunknown; as a precaution, all mammals should be considered susceptible at\nthis time.\n\nPet owners who suspect their animal may have an illness compatible with\nmonkeypox should immediately isolate the animal from humans and other\nanimals and contact their state or local health department. In most cases,\nevaluation by a veterinarian will be recommended. Owners should notify the\nveterinarian before transporting the animal to the clinic so that\nappropriate infection control precautions can be implemented prior to arrival.\n\nOwners should consider wearing a mask and gloves when handling the animal.\nThe animal\u0092s bedding should be collected and bagged and brought with the\nanimal to the veterinary clinic for disposal as medically regulated waste.\n\nSoiled bedding should not be disposed of as household trash. Following\nidentification of an animal with suspect monkeypox in a household, any\nanimals (including dogs and cats) who may have come in contact with the\nsick animal should be closely observed for signs of illness for a period of\n1 month following the last date of exposure. Contaminated household\nsurfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nTransport of the ill animal to a veterinary clinic should be done by a\nsingle individual to limit unnecessary exposure. At the time of animal\ntransport, the owner should also transport the sick animal\u0092s bagged bedding\nfor disposal. Care should be taken to minimize driver exposure during\ntransport. During transport animals should be confined in a closed\ncontainer such as a cardboard box. If available, the animal should be\nconfined in a separate compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a\npickup truck. Following transport, the area of the vehicle where the animal\nwas confined should be cleaned and disinfected. Standard household\ncleaning/disinfectants may be used in accordance with the manufacturer\u0092s\ninstructions.\n\nVeterinarians examining sick prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or other\nmammals that may have come in contact with a suspected monkeypox case,\nshould consider the diagnosis of monkeypox infection. Animals that\ncurrently appear healthy but have been implicated as a probable source of\ninfection for a human case should also be treated as a suspected case of\nmonkeypox. All suspected cases of monkeypox in animals should be reported\nimmediately to state or local health department officials.\n\nVeterinarians who have been notified of an arriving animal with suspected\nmonkeypox should admit the animal through a separate entrance to a private\nroom and place it in isolation; the animal should not be admitted to an\nopen waiting room.\n\nWhen examining or euthanizing sick rodents, lagomorphs, and exotic pets,\nespecially prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill mammal known to\nhave been in contact with a case of monkeypox, the following precautions\nshould be used:\n\n* Hand hygiene after all contact with a sick animal and contaminated surfaces.\n* Use of gown and gloves for any contact with the sick animal and\ncontaminated surfaces.\n* Eye protection (e.g. goggles or face shield) if splash or spray of body\nfluids is likely.\n* Respiratory protection including a NIOSH-certified N95 filtering\ndisposable respirator for entering the exam room. If N95 respirators are\nnot available for health-care personnel, then surgical masks should be worn.*\n* Contain and dispose of contaminated waste in accordance with\nfacility-specific guidelines for medically regulated infectious waste.\n* Handle used patient-care equipment in a manner that prevents\ncontamination of skin and clothing. Ensure that used equipment has been\ncleaned and reprocessed appropriately.\n* Ensure that procedures are in place for cleaning and disinfecting\ncontaminated environmental surfaces. Any EPA-registered hospital\ndetergent-disinfectant currently used by health-care facilities for\nenvironmental sanitation may be used. Manufacturer\u0092s recommendations for\ndilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling should\nbe followed.\n* Laundry (e.g., towels, clothing) may be washed in a standard washing\nmachine with warm water and detergent; bleach may be added but is not\nnecessary. Care should be used when handling soiled laundry to avoid direct\ncontact with contaminated material. Soiled laundry should not be shaken or\notherwise handled in a manner that may aerosolize infectious particles.\n\nAll animals with suspected monkeypox infection should be humanely\neuthanized to prevent further spread of the disease. Humane euthanasia\noptions include pentobarbital injection or gas chamber using isoflurane or\nhalothane for most animals. For small rodent species such as mice, cervical\ndislocation may be considered if performed by a trained person.\n\nCDC is not currently recommending euthanasia of asymptomatic animals that\nmay have been exposed to other infected animals. Exposed asymptomatic\nanimals should be confined to the home and not allowed to come into contact\nwith other animals. They should be observed for development of signs\ncompatible with monkeypox for one month. Should such signs develop, the\nanimal should then be evaluated and euthanized if indicated.\n\nCurrently, CDC is not routinely requesting animal samples for testing.\nHowever, specimens can be collected and stored for possible future testing.\n\nConsultation with the state epidemiologist and state health laboratory is\nnecessary for samples to be sent to CDC for testing.\n<http://www.cste.org/members/state_and_territorial_epi.asp>\n<http://www.aphl.org/public_health_labs/index.cfm>\n\nPrior to euthanasia, whole blood in EDTA tubes or serum can be collected\nand refrigerated at 4 deg C. CDC is not recommending necropsies of animals\nexcept in Biosafety level 3 laboratories by persons recently vaccinated\nwith vaccinia. Instead, the entire carcass may be preserved by freezing at\n\u00ad70 deg C, or submersing in 10 percent formalin and injecting the body\ncavity with as much formalin as it will hold.\n\nFor more information, contact your state or local health department or the\nCDC Emergency Operations Center 770-488-7100. Additional information and\nrecommendations will be released as they become available. Updated\ninformation will be available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox>.\n\n* Respirators should be used in the context of a complete respiratory\nprotection program in accordance with OSHA regulations.

The health\ndepartment would not say whether the store was the same one that has been\nidentified as the source of the monkeypox outbreak. The county quarantine\nis indefinite, but was ordered solely as a precaution. The Health\nDepartment has no reason to believe the animals were ever infected with\nmonkeypox virus, according to spokesman Guillermo Cole. 'The animals are in\ngood health,' Cole said. 'They are well past the 12-day incubation period\nfor developing illness and spreading monkeypox virus.'\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 4 confirmed human\ncases yesterday of monkeypox virus infection, a smallpox-related virus that\nhas never before appeared in the Western Hemisphere. 7 people have been\nhospitalized; no one has died. Steve Ostroff, deputy director of the CDC's\nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, said he expects the numbers to\nrise as human and animal samples are tested. But Ostroff said that only\npeople who had direct contact with infected prairie dogs, or in one case a\nrabbit [that was in contact with a sick prairie dog], have come down with the\nillness. 'For the average citizen, I would not necessarily be concerned at\nthis point of being exposed to monkeypox,' he said.\nState health officials have reported 19 suspected cases in Wisconsin, 13 in\nIndiana, and 4 in Illinois. 4 cases have been confirmed in Wisconsin and\nIllinois.\nInvestigators said the prairie dogs were probably infected with the virus\nby a Gambian giant rat, which is native to Africa, at a Chicago-area pet\ndistributor. The Illinois Department of Agriculture, along with state and\nfederal health officials, is trying to track down 115 customers -- both\nindividuals and pet stores -- that bought exotic animals from Phil's Pocket\nPets since 15 Apr 2003. The distributor, Phillip Moberley, said yesterday\nthat he voluntarily quarantined his home-based business and put to death 70\nprairie dogs.\nThe Allegheny County animals will be quarantined in the homes of the 2\nresidents who purchased them. There is no evidence that any people here\nwere sickened by the animals, Cole said. The prairie dogs were sold to a\npet store owner, who kept one of the animals on display in his store and\nthe other in his home. The prairie dog on display had no contact with other\nanimals, Cole said. The hedgehogs went to a woman who bought them as pets.\nAside from their owner, the animals have had contact only with the woman's\ncat, which is in good health. 'It's not clear to us whether hedgehogs can\nbe infected,' Cole noted. [Hedgehogs belong to the Order Insectivora and\nare unrelated to any of the rodents displaying signs of disease. - Mod.CP]\nMonkeypox in humans is not usually fatal but causes rashes, fevers, and\nchills. Doctors initially feared they might be facing smallpox, which\ncauses similar symptoms. 2 patients at Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital\nin Milwaukee were reported in satisfactory condition Sunday. The 2 were\nisolated, and doctors treating them wore caps, gowns, and masks. Other\nsuspected victims were treated and released.\nHealth officials are trying to contain the virus by preventing more animals\nfrom becoming infected. Wisconsin's Department of Agriculture warned people\nnot to release prairie dogs into the wild. The agency also told state\nhumane societies to isolate any prairie dogs people bring in. Both\nWisconsin and Illinois have banned the sale, importation, and display of\nprairie dogs. The Illinois ban also covers Gambian rats.\nThe popularity of prairie dogs as pets has grown in recent years.

Ostroff of the federal Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. State and federal officials are trying to\ntrack down other people who might have purchased diseased pet prairie dogs,\nwhich are believed to be the source of the outbreak.\nNone of the victims has died, but authorities are taking aggressive action\nto contain the epidemic for fear that the virus will obtain a permanent\nfoothold in the United States, much as West Nile virus did after a case was\nidentified in New York City in 1999. West Nile virus spread from coast to\ncoast, infecting nearly 4200 people last year and killing 284. Although\nmonkeypox virus does not seem to be [highly contagious] and probably is not\nas lethal, authorities would like to stop it in its tracks. Monkeypox\n[virus] is closely related to smallpox [virus] but is not as infectious nor\nas deadly. It is usually found only in the rain forest countries of western\nand central Africa.\nWisconsin officials were startled last month [May 2003] when a 3-year-old\nchild was hospitalized with a high fever, swollen glands and red pustules on\nher body, typically signs of smallpox. Both of her parents developed a milder\nform of the disease. Scientists at the Marshfield Clinic quickly identified a\nvirus that looked like a poxvirus [by electron microscopy]. The CDC heard\nabout the finding late Wednesday and immediately dispatched a research team,\nwhich returned to Atlanta with samples on Friday night. By Saturday\nafternoon, CDC researchers had confirmed that the virus was monkeypox virus\nand made the information public, looking for other cases. As of yesterday\nafternoon, 22 suspected cases had been reported in Wisconsin, 10 in Indiana\nand 5 in Illinois. Ostroff said it is likely that most of the suspected cases\nwill be confirmed.\nThe cases were quickly linked to contact with prairie dogs and, in one case,\na rabbit. The animals were traced back to a suburban Chicago business, Phil's\nPocket Pets, which specializes in small, friendly rodents. Researchers think\nthe prairie dogs came into contact with a Gambian giant rat, also imported as\na pet, which apparently carried the virus. State and federal health\nauthorities are trying to track down 115 customers, individuals and pet\nstores, that have purchased the prairie dogs from the store since 15 Apr 2003.\nOfficials have seen no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus,\nOstroff said. Everyone who has caught it has been in close contact with the\nanimals. That included 6 veterinarians, their assistants and '3 or 4' in pet\nshops, he said. The rest of the victims were in families that purchased the\nanimals. One caught it from a rabbit that had been in contact with a sick\nprairie dog. Officials have warned anyone in the region with a prairie dog\nthat appears to be ill to contact public health authorities or a\nveterinarian. Under no circumstances should a sick animal be released into\nthe wild, where it could infect other animals, they said.\nMonkeypox virus is a member of the [_Orthopoxvirus_ genus of the family\n_Poxviridae_], which includes smallpox virus. Symptoms, which usually begin\nabout 12 days after exposure, include fever, headache, body aches, chills,\ndrenching sweat and sometimes a cough. One to 10 days later, these symptoms\nare followed by a rash with pustules that eventually crust over. Contact\nwith the pustules is the primary source of transmission, but it can be\nspread by coughing.\nThere is no treatment for the disease, although the CDC is testing\ncidofovir, an antiviral drug. Studies in Africa suggest that 1 percent to 10\npercent of victims have died, but researchers note that the higher mortality\nrates occurred in people who were chronically malnourished, making it\ndifficult for them to fight off the infection. Studies in Africa have also\nshown that even though the virus can be passed from person to person, it\nloses much of its virulence and infectiousness after several generations of\ninfection, breaking the transmission chain. Vaccinations against smallpox\napparently provide some protection against monkeypox infections.\n[By Thomas H. Maugh II]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The identity of the infectious agent appears to be have been confirmed\nunequivocally as Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus, like smallpox virus, is a\nmember of the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ of the family _Poxviridae_, but the two\nviruses are not the most closely related members of the genus. The name of\nthe virus is misleading as monkeys -- and probably humans -- become infected\nby exposure to the rodent or squirrel natural reservoir host. Person-to-person\ntransmission is rare and does not appear to have occurred in this outbreak\nin the Midwest (the first outside West/Central Africa).

[By Thomas H.

By Saturday\nafternoon, CDC researchers had confirmed that the virus was monkeypox virus\nand made the information public, looking for other cases. Researchers think\nthe prairie dogs came into contact with a Gambian giant rat, also imported as\na pet, which apparently carried the virus. The\nprincipal concern is the possibility that the virus might spread to wild\nrodent populations by accidental release, or escape of infected pet animals. State and federal health\nauthorities are trying to track down 115 customers, individuals and pet\nstores, that have purchased the prairie dogs from the store since 15 Apr 2003. The name of\nthe virus is misleading as monkeys -- and probably humans -- become infected\nby exposure to the rodent or squirrel natural reservoir host. --------------------------\n9 new cases of suspected monkeypox were reported in the Midwest by state\nand federal health authorities yesterday Although\nmonkeypox virus does not seem to be [highly contagious] and probably is not\nas lethal, authorities would like to stop it in its tracks. State and federal officials are trying to\ntrack down other people who might have purchased diseased pet prairie dogs,\nwhich are believed to be the source of the outbreak.

The Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention is expected to make the vaccinations\navailable as an option to highly selected groups like health workers who\ncare for patients with monkeypox, people who have been exposed to animals\nsick with monkeypox, veterinarians who care for animals suspected of having\nit, and scientists investigating monkeypox.\n\nThe investigation of human monkeypox cases expanded to a fourth state, New\nJersey, yesterday as the number of suspected monkeypox cases rose to 50: 23\nin Indiana, 20 in Wisconsin, 6 in Illinois, and 1 in New Jersey. No one has\ndied. The total is more than double the 23 cases reported in 3 states when\nthe CDC urgently announced the outbreak over the weekend. The increase in\ncases under investigation has resulted largely from widespread publicity\nthat led people to report rashes and illness to health officials, officials\nof the Centers in Atlanta said. The monkeypox cases are the first detected\nin the Americas. Most suspected cases had direct contact with prairie dogs\nor while working in veterinarian offices and pet shops.\n\nMonkeypox patients typically fall ill with signs and symptoms like fever,\nheadaches, dry cough, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and drenching sweats.\nOne to 10 days later, patients develop rashes consisting of blister-like\npimples which fill with pus, break open, and produce scabs. The rash often\nerupts in different stages, or crops, as it appears on the head, trunk,\narms, and legs.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also expected today to\nannounce a definition of human monkeypox, which will be critical in\ndetermining who would be eligible for smallpox vaccinations as well as in\ninvestigating the outbreak. United States officials stopped routine\nsmallpox vaccinations in 1970, about a decade before eradication of\nsmallpox from the world.\n\nOn Mon 9 Jun 2003, a subgroup of a national panel of immunization experts\nappointed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to serve on its\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices began discussions on whether\nand how the smallpox vaccine might be used. Discussions focused on the\nbenefits and risks of smallpox vaccine for monkeypox, a viral disease that\ncan be fatal in 10 percent of human cases. The death rate for smallpox was\nabout 30 percent.\n\nBut smallpox vaccination can also be fatal. Studies from the 1960's, when\nsmallpox vaccinations were routine, found that for every million people\nolder than 1 year who were vaccinated, 1 or 2 died, 9 suffered from brain\ninfection, and more than 100 developed eczema vaccinatum, a severe illness\nand skin rash that can leave deep scars and can occasionally be\nlife-threatening.\n\nThe government owns all the smallpox vaccine in the United States. This\nyear, the government began offering it to health care workers to protect\nagainst any cases that might result from an attack in which terrorists\nreleased the virus. The only known stocks of smallpox virus are kept at the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and in Russia, both with the\napproval of the World Health Organization. But the Bush administration has\nwarned that Iraq as well as other countries and rogue groups might have\nobtained smallpox virus from the official stores in Russia and begun a\nprogram to vaccinate health care workers before the war began against Iraq.\nThe number of people for whom smallpox vaccine might be offered to protect\nagainst monkeypox would be small, the panel's chairman, Dr. John F. Modlin,\nsaid in an interview before the panel's meeting.\n\n[Byline: Lawrence Altman]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In a paper by Fine, Jezek, Grab, and Dixon (ref.1 below), an 85 percent\nprotective rate of smallpox vaccination in prevention of monkeypox was\nestimated during outbreaks in Zaire in the period 1980-1984. In 1991, the\nUnited States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\nrecommended (see ref. 3 below) its use among laboratory and health-care\nworkers occupationally exposed to vaccinia, recombinant vaccinia viruses,\nand other orthopoxviruses that can infect humans. In the 22 Jun 2002 ACIP\nrecommendations for 'pre-event' smallpox vaccination use (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm>)\nthere is mention of use among laboratory and health care workers\noccupationally exposed to non-variola orthopoxviruses.\n\nThe risks and benefits must be weighed in any vaccination decision; the\nobserved case fatality rate of human monkeypox infection in the Dem.\nRepublic of the Congo is approximately 10 percent. It has been suggested\nthat the mortality associated with monkeypox is related to the nutritional\nstatus of the host, and in the case of the outbreak in the DRC, may have\nbeen associated with impaired nutritional status. So far in the USA\noutbreak, there have been no deaths reported due to monkeypox infection,\nwith the majority of cases to date described as mild. The cited 'case\nfatality rate' following vaccination with the smallpox vaccine ranged from\n1.1 to 1.5 per million vaccinees (from 1968 studies -- data available for\nreview at:\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>).\n\nThe pre-event smallpox vaccination program has now vaccinated over 500 000\nindividuals, with several deaths temporally associated with receipt of\nvaccine but attributable to myocardial infarction. We await further\nofficial information on a decision to use smallpox vaccination in this\ncurrent outbreak. A difficult decision, especially in the absence of a\nlarge body of data with which to compare various strategic options. - Mod.MPP]\n\nReferences:\n--------\n1: Fine PE, Jezek Z, Grab B, Dixon H.

'Close\ncontact with sick prairie dogs, Gambian rats, and other exotic animals\nshould be minimized immediately,' warned Robert Teclaw, state\nepidemiologist for Indiana, where 10 new cases were reported. 'Owners of\nsuch animals should contact a veterinarian and consult with them on the\nsituation.'\n\nPublic health workers were trying to track down dozens of prairie dogs\npossibly infected with the virus and sold as pets during the past 2 months in\nWisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois. While the monkeypox illness is not as\nharmful as smallpox, officials feared the virus could jump to native wildlife\nsuch as squirrels and become endemic, creating a new health hazard in the\nhemisphere.\n\nThe Texas Department of Health said federal agricultural officials had\nordered 2 dealers in that state not to buy or sell any animals until the\nhealth of those now in their possession had been checked out. That action\ncame after a Chicago-area exotic pet dealer said he bought from a Texas\nbreeder Gambian giant rats apparently carrying the virus that then spread\nto his prairie dogs. Doug McBride, a spokesman for the department, said:\n'It appears that there was a shipment of Gambian rats and maybe some other\nanimals from Africa to a Texas dealer. We and other agencies are involved\nin tracking down those animals to see what health they are in and whether\nthere have been any human illnesses.'\n\nSo far, no suspect animal or human cases had been found in Texas, he said.\nMcBride also said investigators had not been able to place the Gambian rats\nat the same location with any prairie dogs in Texas, leading them to\nconclude the infection spread after the animals left the state.\n\nPrairie dogs, a member of the squirrel family, are shipped by the thousands\nfrom the Plains states every year for use as pets. Ranchers consider them\nnuisances because of the holes they dig to house their colonies. The\ndisease is not fatal in all cases in prairie dogs. It causes an eye\ninfection and nose lesions in the animals, and can be spread to humans when\nthey handle them.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[see also;\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (WI, IL, IN) 20030608.1412\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(02) 20030609.1422\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(03) 20030610.1433\nMonkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA(WI,IL,IN)(04) 20030611.1436\n2002\n-----\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (07) 20021025.5638\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) 20020228.3654\nMonkeypox - Congo DR (Equateur) (06) 20020410.3926\n2001\n----\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur) (02) 20010927.2353\nMonkeypox, suspected - Congo DR (Equateur): RFI 20010315.0523\n2000\n----\nMonkeypox - Congo, Dem.

Damon, P. B.\nJahrling and B. Moss) describes the complete sequencing and analysis\nof the structure of the genome of monkeypox virus, and the\nrelationship of monkeypox virus to smallpox virus.\nMonkeypox virus belongs to the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ of the family\n_Poxviridae_, is endemic in parts of Africa, and causes a human\ndisease that resembles smallpox. The 196 858 base-pair genome of\nmonkeypox virus has been analyzed with regard to its structural\nfeatures and content of open reading frames.\nEach end of the genome contains an identical but oppositely oriented\n6379 base-pair terminal inverted repetition, which is similar to that of\nother orthopoxviruses, includes a putative telomere resolution\nsequence and short tandem repeats. Computer-assisted analysis was\nused to identify 190 open reading frames containing 60 [or more]\namino acid residues. Of these, 4 were present within the inverted\nterminal repetition.\nThe genome of Monkeypox virus contains the known essential\northopoxvirus genes but only a subset of the putative immuno-\nmodulatory and host range genes.

Scientists\nat the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin, recovered viral\nisolates from a patient and a prairie dog and demonstrated a virus\nmorphologically consistent with a poxvirus by electron microscopy (see\n<http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/crc/prairiedog.asp>\nfor electron microscopy images).\nPreliminary results of serologic testing, polymerase-chain-reaction\n[PCR] analysis, and gene sequencing performed at the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 6-7 Jun 2003 indicated that\nthe causative agent is monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus\ngroup of viruses. Results of additional evaluation at CDC by electron\nmicroscopy and immunohistochemical studies are consistent with the\nfinding of an orthopoxvirus. These findings represent the first evidence\nof community-acquired monkeypox-like infection in the United States.\nFurther characterization of the virus is in progress.\nHuman monkeypox is a rare zoonotic viral disease that occurs primarily\nin the rain forest countries of central and west Africa. In humans, the\nillness produces a vesicular and pustular rash similar to that of smallpox.\nLimited person-to-person spread of infection has been reported in\ndisease-endemic areas in Africa; the incubation period is about 12 days.\nCase-fatality ratios in Africa have ranged from 1% to 10% -- for\nadditional information about monkeypox, see\n\nAs of Sat 7Jun 2003, cases of suspected monkeypox had been reported\namong residents of Wisconsin (17), northern Illinois (1), and\nnorthwestern Indiana (1). Onset of illness among patients began in early\nMay [2003]. Patients typically experienced a prodrome consisting of\nfever, headaches, myalgias, chills, and drenching sweats. Roughly one-\nthird of patients had nonproductive cough. This prodromal phase was\nfollowed 1-10 days later by the development of a papular rash that\ntypically progressed through stages of vesiculation, pustulation,\numbilication, and crusting. In some patients, early lesions have become\nulcerated. Rash distribution and lesions have occurred on head, trunk, and\nextremities; many of the patients had initial and satellite lesions on palms\nand soles and extremities. Rashes were generalized in some patients.\nAfter onset of the rash, patients have generally manifested rash lesions in\ndifferent stages.\nAll patients reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs, most of\nwhich were sick. Illness in prairie dogs was frequently reported as\nbeginning with a blepharoconjunctivitis, progressing to presence of\nnodular lesions in some cases. Some prairie dogs have died\nfrom the illness, while others reportedly recovered.\nIn May [2003] the prairie dogs were sold by a Milwaukee animal\ndistributor to 2 pet shops in the Milwaukee area and during a pet 'swap\nmeet' (pets for sale or exchange) in northern Wisconsin. The Milwaukee\nanimal distributor had obtained prairie dogs and a Gambian giant rat that\nwas ill at the time from a northern Illinois animal distributor. It is unclear\nwhether other retail outlets are involved. Investigations are under way to\ntrace back the source of the prairie dogs and the Gambian giant rat and\ndetermine if distributors in other states might be involved. Animal\nspecies susceptible to monkeypox virus may include non-human\nprimates, lagomorphs (rabbits), and some rodents.\nOn the basis of preliminary findings from this investigation, it appears\nthat the primary route of transmission may be from infected prairie dogs\nto humans as a result of close contact. However, the possibility of human-\nto-human transmission cannot be excluded at this time. As a precaution\nuntil additional information is available, the measures below should be\nfollowed.\nGeneral Prevention\n------------------\nAvoid contact with any prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats that appear to\nbe ill (e.g., are missing patches of fur, have a visible rash on the skin, or\nhave a discharge from eyes or nose). Wash hands thoroughly after any\ncontact with prairie dogs, Gambian giant rats, or any ill animal.\nDiagnosis\n-----------\nPhysicians should consider monkeypox in persons with fever, cough,\nheadache, myalgias, rash, or lymph node enlargement within 3 weeks\nafter contact with prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats. Inform the treating\nphysician or other clinician of the animal exposure.\nVeterinarians\n-------------\nVeterinarians examining sick exotic animal species, especially prairie\ndogs and Gambian giant rats, should consider monkeypox. Veterinarians\nshould also be alert to the development of illness in other animal species\nthat may have been housed with ill prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats.\nTreatment\n--------\nNo specific treatment recommendations are being made at this time.\nSmallpox vaccine has been reported to reduce the risk of monkeypox\namong previously vaccinated persons in Africa. CDC is assessing the\npotential role of postexposure use of smallpox vaccine as well as\ntherapeutic use of the antiviral drug cidofovir. [A newswire report states\nthat one of the victims had been vaccinated against smallpox back in\n1972. - Mod.JW]\nReporting\n---------\nHealth care providers, veterinarians, and public health personnel should\nreport cases of these illnesses in humans and animals to their state or\nlocal health departments as soon as they are suspected.\nSubmission of Specimens from Patients with Suspected Monkeypox\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nProcedures recommended for collection of samples for diagnosis of\npotential monkeypox disease are essentially the same as those for\ndiagnosis of the related orthopoxvirus diseases, vaccinia and smallpox.\nFor information regarding collection of serum specimens and lesions,\nplease refer to the smallpox laboratory testing guidelines at\n.

Some of the Gambian rats\nended up with an Illinois pet dealer believed to have sold prairie dogs\nlinked to a cluster of monkeypox illnesses in the Midwest. Health officials\nsuspect that one or more of the imported Gambian rats infected the prairie\ndogs sold by the Illinois dealer.\nTexas Department of Health officials said that of the 50 Gambian rats\nimported in the early April shipment, 10 died en route to the Texas\ndistributor or shortly after arrival, one died later at the distributor's\npremises, 5 were shipped to a pet store within Texas, 9 remain alive at the\ndistributor's premises, and from 18 to 25 of the rats were sent to an Iowa\ndistributor with 18 of those sent from Iowa to the Illinois dealer. Of the\n5 sold to the pet store in Texas, one was sold to an individual.\nAuthorities said the animal and the owner are fine. The other 4 died.\nOfficials said it is not unusual for deaths to occur in wild animals\nbrought into captivity and that the deaths cannot be assumed to have been\ncaused by monkeypox. TDH officials are hopeful that testing of the live\nGambian rats remaining at the distributor's premises and of a dead Gambian\nrat from the pet store that had been kept frozen may offer additional clues\nin the ongoing multi-state investigation.\nTexas officials also said that while the prairie dogs sold by the dealer in\nIllinois are believed to have come from a Texas distributor, it is not the\nsame dealer who supplied the Gambian rats. They said it does not appear\nthat the prairie dogs and Gambian rats were ever in the same facility in\nTexas. The prairie dogs were shipped directly to the Illinois dealer.\nAuthorities stressed that the investigation is continuing, including the\ntracking of other animals imported with the Gambian rats.\nEarlier today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food\nand Drug Administration issued a joint order prohibiting the import of\nrodents from Africa and banning the distribution, sale, and transport of\nprairie dogs and 6 species of African rodents within the United States.\n--\nThomas Benoit\nProfessor of Biology\nMcMurry University\nAbilene, TX 79697\n<benoitt@mcmurryadm.mcm.edu>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 52(23);537-540, Fri 13 Jun\n2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5223a1.htm>\n\nMultistate Outbreak of Monkeypox --- Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, 2003*\n--------------------------------------------------\n*[one more case has since been reported from New Jersey -- see section [3]\nbelow. - Mod.JW]\nCDC has received reports of patients with a febrile rash illness who had\nclose contact with pet prairie dogs and other animals. The Marshfield\nClinic, Marshfield, Wisconsin, identified a virus morphologically\nconsistent with a poxvirus by electron microscopy of skin lesion tissue\nfrom a patient, lymph node tissue from the patient's pet prairie dog, and\nisolates of virus from culture of these tissues. Additional laboratory\ntesting at CDC indicated that the causative agent is Monkeypox virus, a\nmember of the _Orthopoxvirus_ [genus of the family _Poxviridae_]. This\nreport summarizes initial descriptive epidemiologic, clinical, and\nlaboratory data, interim infection-control guidance, and new animal import\nregulations.\nAs of Tue 11 Jun 2003, a total of 53 cases had been investigated in\nIllinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Of these, 29 (49 percent) cases were\namong males; the median age was 26 years (range: 4 to 53 years). Data were\nunavailable for sex and age for 2 and 14 patients, respectively. A total of\n14 (26 percent) patients have been hospitalized, including a child aged <10\nyears with encephalitis.\nDetailed clinical information was available for 30 cases reported in\nIllinois and Wisconsin. Among these, the earliest reported onset of illness\nwas on 15 May 2003. For the majority of patients (22 [73 percent]), a\nfebrile illness has either preceded or accompanied the onset of a papular\nrash; respiratory symptoms (16 [64 percent]), lymphadenopathy (14 [47\npercent]), and sore throat (10 [33 percent]) also were prominent signs and\nsymptoms (Table). The rash typically progressed through stages of\nvesiculation, pustulation, umbilication, and encrustation. Early lesions\nbecame ulcerated in some patients. Rash distribution and lesions have\noccurred on the head, trunk, and extremities; many patients had initial and\nsatellite lesions on palms, soles, and extremities. Rashes were generalized\nin some patients.\nAll patients have had contact with animals; however, at least 2 patients\nalso reported contact with another patient's lesions or ocular drainage. A\ntotal of 51 patients reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs\n(Cynomys sp.), and one patient reported contact with a Gambian giant rat\n(Cricetomys sp.). One patient had contact with a rabbit (family Leporidae)\nthat became ill after exposure to an ill prairie dog at a veterinary\nclinic. Traceback investigations have been initiated to identify the source\nof the monkeypox virus introduced into the United States and have\nidentified a common distributor where prairie dogs and Gambian giant rats\nwere housed together in Illinois. A search of imported animal records\nrevealed that Gambian giant rats were shipped from Ghana in April 2003 to a\nwildlife importer in Texas and subsequently were sold to the Illinois\ndistributor. The shipment contained approximately 800 small mammals of 9\ndifferent species that might have been the actual source of introduction of\nmonkeypox.\nAs of Mon 9 Jun 2003, specimens obtained from 10 patients in Illinois,\nIndiana, and Wisconsin had been forwarded to CDC for testing; 9 patients\nwith skin lesions had DNA sequence signatures specific for monkeypox virus.\nNo skin lesions were observed in one patient who tested negative by\npolymerase chain reaction. Skin biopsies were available for 5 patients; 4\nshowed orthopoxviral antigens by immunohistochemical testing. Skin lesions\nfrom four of the 10 patients were evaluated by negative stain electron\nmicroscopy, and poxviral particles were found in 3 patients.\nMonkeypox specific DNA signatures also were found in a viral isolate\nderived from lymphoid tissue of a patient's ill prairie dog.\n(Reported by multiple contributors -- see original on web for list)\nMMWR Editorial Note\n---------------\nIn 1970, human monkeypox was first identified in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (DRC) in a region where smallpox had been eradicated in 1968 (1).\nMonkeypox is caused by an orthopoxvirus that clinically resembles smallpox\nvirus but differs both biologically and epidemiologically (2--5). After an\nincubation period of 7 to 17 days, the disease is characterized by the\nonset of a prodrome of fever, headache, backache, and fatigue. The\nmonkeypox rash includes macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts\nthat evolve in the same stage over 14 to 21 days, similar to smallpox (6).\nA major clinical difference between monkeypox and smallpox is pronounced\nlymphadenopathy in a majority of patients with monkeypox (6). Relatively\ninefficient person-to-person transmission has been documented for\nmonkeypox, and the case-fatality rate has been approximately 1 to 10\npercent in Africa, with higher death rates among young children (2,5,6).\nPreliminary findings from these investigations indicate that the primary\nroute of transmission to humans is close contact with infected mammalian\npets. However, the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be\nexcluded. CDC has issued interim guidance for infection control, exposure\nmanagement, monitoring of exposed persons, and duration of isolation\nprocedures in health-care and community settings for patients with\nsuspected monkeypox:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/infectioncontrol.htm>.\nPersons seeking medical care with unexplained fever, rash, or prominent\nlymphadenopathy should be asked about exposure to unusual or exotic pets,\nespecially small mammals such as prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats. If\nmonkeypox infection is suspected, standard, contact, and airborne\nprecautions should be applied in all health-care settings:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/ISOLAT/Isolat.htm>.\nInterim guidance for veterinarians and pet owners also are available at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/animalguidance.htm>. These\nrecommendations are modeled after human infection-control guidelines, with\nmodifications appropriate for veterinary and home settings where airborne\nprecautions might not be feasible. In addition, these guidelines outline\nthe appropriate management of exposed or ill pets to help prevent further\ntransmission of monkeypox among animals.\nIntroduction of exotic species, such as rodents from Africa, poses a\nserious public health threat because of the potential of monkeypox virus\ninfection and other nonindigenous pathogens. Serosurveys of various healthy\nrodents (and nonhuman primates), including _Cricetomys emini_, captured\nwild in Africa, have demonstrated orthopoxvirus antibodies (7). Monkeypox\nvirus also has been isolated from a rope squirrel (_Funisciurus\nanerythrus_) found with skin lesions in the vicinity of monkeypox cases in\nDRC (8).

Wisconsin state epidemiologist Jeff Davis said monkeypox virus\nhadn't yet been confirmed in the worker, but it was suspected and experts\nwere testing tissue specimens.\nThe announcement came a day after U.S. government moved aggressively to\ncontain the first outbreak of monkeypox in the Western Hemisphere by\nprohibiting imports of African rodents, banning the sale of prairie dogs --\nbelieved to have spread the virus to humans -- and recommending smallpox\nshots for people exposed to monkeypox. The government also expanded its\nsearch for infected prairie dogs to 15 states.\nThe smallpox vaccine can prevent monkeypox, an exotic African disease, up\nto 2 weeks after exposure to the virus but is most effective in the first 4\ndays. 'We're optimistic we can deliver the vaccine to these people in time\nto do good,' said Dr. David Fleming, the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention's deputy director for Public Health and Science.\nAs of Wed 11 Jun 2003, health officials had confirmed a total of 9 human\ncases of the disease -- 4 in Wisconsin, 4 in Indiana, and one in Illinois.\n54 possible cases had been reported -- 25 in Indiana, 17 in Wisconsin, 11\nin Illinois, and one in New Jersey, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said. No one\nin the United States has died of the disease. Fleming said he is confident\nthe outbreak will be controlled.\n'Monkeypox is a disease that is potentially transmissible from person to\nperson but at a fairly low level,' he said. 'I don't anticipate the same\nkind of problem that we anticipate from SARS.'\nFleming said the smallpox vaccine is 85 percent effective against\nmonkeypox. The smallpox vaccine is widely available because states stocked\nup on it out of fear of bioterrorism. More than 37 000 health workers in\nthe United States have been vaccinated. The CDC said health care workers,\nveterinarians, and family members who have cared for or had close contact\nwith infected people or animals should get vaccinations. The agency also\nwarned veterinarians and doctors to be on the lookout for the symptoms,\nespecially in owners of prairie dogs or exotic rodents from Africa.\nAbout 40 out of every million people given the smallpox vaccine for the\nfirst time will face a life-threatening injury, and one or 2 will die.\nStill, the CDC is recommending vaccinations even for pregnant women,\nchildren, and people with eczema -- for whom the vaccine is usually\ndiscouraged -- who have been exposed to infected prairie dogs. 'Because of\nthe real risk here ... we're recommending a somewhat aggressive approach of\nwho should get the vaccine,' Fleming said.\n[Byline: Daniel Yee]\n--\nJames M Wilson, V, MD\nDivision of Integrated Biodefense\nImaging Science and Information Systems (ISIS) Center\nGeorgetown University Medical Center\nWashington, DC\n<IceAxe5@aol.com>\n[This report of human-to-human transmission of monkeypox virus infection\nshould be regarded with caution until there is laboratory confirmation of\nthe diagnosis. - Mod.CP]\n******\n[4]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: Thomas E.

Some of the Gambian rats\nended up with an Illinois pet dealer believed to have sold prairie dogs\nlinked to a cluster of monkeypox illnesses in the Midwest. Texas officials also said that while the prairie dogs sold by the dealer in\nIllinois are believed to have come from a Texas distributor, it is not the\nsame dealer who supplied the Gambian rats.

Skin lesions\nfrom four of the 10 patients were evaluated by negative stain electron\nmicroscopy, and poxviral particles were found in 3 patients. The\nmonkeypox rash includes macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts\nthat evolve in the same stage over 14 to 21 days, similar to smallpox (6). They said it does not appear\nthat the prairie dogs and Gambian rats were ever in the same facility in\nTexas. The agency also\nwarned veterinarians and doctors to be on the lookout for the symptoms,\nespecially in owners of prairie dogs or exotic rodents from Africa. Additional laboratory\ntesting at CDC indicated that the causative agent is Monkeypox virus, a\nmember of the _Orthopoxvirus_ [genus of the family _Poxviridae_]. Gambian rats remaining at the distributor's premises and of a dead Gambian\nrat from the pet store that had been kept frozen may offer additional clues\nin the ongoing multi-state investigation.

(AP) - A virus related to smallpox that has never been\ndetected in the Western Hemisphere may be the cause of a mysterious\ndisease spreading from pet prairie dogs to people across the upper\nMidwest, health officials said Saturday.\nDr. James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious\nDiseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a\ngroup of prairie dogs sold from a suburban Chicago pet distributor\nappears to be infected with the monkeypox virus, a member of the same\nviral family that causes smallpox but is not nearly as deadly.\nMonkeypox has typically been found in West African rain forests,\nHughes said. The death rate among infected humans has ranged from 1\nto 10 percent.\nHughes said although monkeypox is spread primarily through rodents in\nAfrica, scientists haven't ruled out person-to-person transmission.\n'We're in the very early stages of classifying this virus,' Hughes\nsaid. 'We're not certain.'\nSince early May [2003] , 17 possible cases have been reported in\nWisconsin in people as young as 4 and as old as 48. 2 possible cases\nhave been reported in Illinois and one has been reported in Indiana,\nhealth officials from all 3 states said.\nThey appeared to have been exposed to prairie dogs - rodents whose\npopularity as pets has grown in recent years. They reported fever,\ncoughs, rashes and swollen lymph nodes.\nCDC and state health officials are still researching the disease with\nsamples from the infected prairie dogs and humans, but the virus\nappears susceptible to the anti-viral drug Cidofovir, Hughes said. He\nisn't aware of any long-term aftereffects of monkeypox.\nNo one has died or become severely ill in the current outbreak,\nHughes said. But 4 people in Wisconsin had to be hospitalized at\nFroedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, hospital spokesman Mark\nMcLaughlin said. 2 remained hospitalized in satisfactory condition\nSaturday.\nAuthorities don't believe bioterrorism was involved. Investigators\nhave traced the origin of the outbreak to a pet distributor in\nVilla Park, Ill. That distributor had a giant Gambian rat, indigenous\nto African countries, that may have infected batches of prairie dogs,\nHughes said.\nSK Exotics, a South Milwaukee pet distributor, bought prairie dogs\nfrom the Villa Park distributor and imported them to Wisconsin.\n2 pet stores, Hoffer TropicLife Pets in Milwaukee and Rainbow Pets in\nShorewood, a Milwaukee suburb, bought some dogs from SK Exotics.\nMore prairie dogs from Villa Park found their way to northern\nWisconsin through a Wausau swap meet, said Dr. Mark Wegner, chief of\nthe Wisconsin Communicable Disease Epidemiology Section.\nWisconsin agriculture officials have taken several emergency steps\nsince word of the outbreak broke earlier this week.\nThe state Department of Health and Family Services issued an\nemergency order Friday banning the sale, importation and display of\nprairie dogs.\nAlso Friday, acting state veterinarian Dr. Robert Ehlenfeldt imposed\nquarantines on SK Exotics, Hoffer TropicLife Pets, Rainbow Pets and\nthe Dorchester home of Tammy Kautzer, who apparently sells animals to\nswap meets, Gilson said.\nThe quarantines prohibit movement of any prairie dogs or mammals that\ncome in contact with them.\n[One of the cases] said she got 2 female prairie dogs from SK Exotics\non 5 May 2003. Neither looked sick at first, she said, but one\neventually began to look tired. [She] said she got sick in mid-May\nwith blisters, coughing and a\n101-degree fever. Hospital staff gave her aspirin, told her it was a\nviral infection and she went home, she said.\nMeanwhile, state and federal investigators are still trying to track\ndown animals sold from the Villa Park distributor. The source of the\nGambian rat is still unknown, they said.\nThe World Health Organization has released facts about the disease:\na. The disease has never before been reported in the Western Hemisphere.\nb. It is usually found in remote villages in Central and West Africa.\nc. Monkeypox is related to the virus that caused smallpox, and smallpox\nvaccinations also gave protection against it.\nd. The death rate among those with monkeypox ranges from 1 to 10\npercent, with the highest rates among young children.\ne. The disease is usually transmitted to people from squirrels and\nprimates through a bite or contact with the animal's blood.\n--\nGeorge A.

Thus\nfar, 19 cases have been reported: 17 in Wisconsin, one in Northern\nIllinois, and one in Northern Indiana. All patients who have become\nill reported direct or close contact with ill prairie dogs.\nCDC is advising physicians, veterinarians, and the public to report\ninstances of rash illness associated with exposure to prairie dogs,\nGambian rats and other animals to local and state public health\nauthorities. CDC also has issued interim recommendations for\ninfection control calling for health care personnel attending\nhospitalized patients to follow standard precautions for guarding\nagainst airborne or contact illness. Veterinarians examining or\ntreating sick rodents, rabbits and such exotic pets as prairie dogs\nand Gambian rats are advised to use personal protective equipment,\nincluding gloves, surgical mask or N-95 respirator, and gowns.\nThe prairie dogs were sold by a Milwaukee animal distributor in May\nto two pet shops in the Milwaukee area and during a pet \u0093swap meet\u0094\n(pets for sale or exchange) in northern Wisconsin. The Milwaukee\nanimal distributor obtained prairie dogs and a Gambian giant rat that\nwas ill at the time from a northern Illinois animal distributor.\nInvestigations are underway to trace the source of animals and the\nsubsequent distribution of animals from the Illinois distributor.\nPreliminary information suggests that animals from this distributor\nmay have been sold in several other states.\nHuman monkeypox is a rare, zoonotic, viral disease that occurs\nprimarily in the rain forest countries of Central and West Africa. It\nis a member of the orthopox family of viruses. In humans, infection\nwith monkeypox virus results in a rash illness similar to but less\ninfectious than smallpox. Monkeypox in humans is not usually fatal.\nThe incubation period is about 12 days. Animal species susceptible to\nmonkeypox virus may include non-human primates, rabbits, and some\nrodents.\nScientists at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin,\nrecovered the first viral isolates from a patient and a prairie dog.\nThrough examination with an electron microscope they demonstrated a\npoxvirus.\nPhysicians should consider monkeypox in persons with fever, cough,\nheadache, myalgia, rash, or lymph node enlargement within 3 weeks\nafter contact with prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats. Veterinarians\nexamining sick exotic animal species, especially prairie dogs and\nGambian giant rats, should consider the possibility of monkeypox.\nVeterinarians should also be alert to the development of illness in\nother animal species that may have been housed with ill prairie dogs\nor Gambian giant rats.\nLocal, state, and federal agencies and private institutions that have\nparticipated in this investigation to date have included the\nMarshfield Clinic and Marshfield Laboratories, Froedtert Hospital and\nMedical College of Wisconsin, the City of Milwaukee Health Department\nand at least 10 additional health departments in Wisconsin and\nIllinois, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, Wisconsin\nDepartment of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection and Wisconsin\nState Laboratory of Hygiene, the Illinois Department of Public\nHealth, the Illinois State Department of Agriculture, the Indiana\nState Department of Health, and the US Department of Agriculture.\n<http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/crc/prairiedog.asp> (electron\nmicroscopy images)\nFor additional information about monkeypox, see\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutinG1.htm>\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[As mentioned in the above reports, this is the first identification\nof monkeypox in the Western Hemisphere.

I wonder when and how it arrived on US shores, and\nif it was in the incubation period during transit... or if there has\nbeen an ongoing slow outbreak among these exotic animals for some\ntime that is just coming to notice now that it is spilling over into\nthe human population.\nAs per the newswire report, cases have occurred in individuals ages 4\nthrough 48. It will be very interesting to see the real age\ndistribution of these cases, to see if there is persistent immunity\nfrom earlier smallpox vaccination (pre-1972). It will also be of\ninterest to know the smallpox vaccination status of the cases that\noccurred in individuals born before 1972 when smallpox vaccination\nwas discontinued (a possible natural study on the duration of\nimmunity from earlier smallpox vaccination in the USA). The\ncessation of smallpox vaccination has been associated with an\nobserved increase in monkeypox activity in central Africa (see EID\narticle above and WHO fact sheet information below).\nMonkeypox is a viral disease with a clinical presentation in humans\nsimilar to that seen in the past in smallpox patients. Monkeypox is\nseen as a sporadic disease in parts of Africa. The virus responsible\nfor monkeypox is related to the virus that causes smallpox\n(orthopoxviruses). Vaccination against smallpox gave protection\nagainst monkeypox. Before the eradication of smallpox, vaccination\nwas widely practised and protected against both diseases. However,\nchildren born after 1980 have not been vaccinated against smallpox\nand are likely to be more susceptible to monkeypox than older members\nof the population. The death rate from monkeypox is highest in young\nchildren, reaching about 10 percent.\nMost cases occur in remote villages of Central and West Africa close\nto tropical rainforests where there is frequent contact with infected\nanimals. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans from squirrels\nand primates through contact with the animal's blood or through a\nbite.\nAn outbreak of human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo (DRC) in 1997 was associated with person-to-person\ntransmission; a change from prior limited outbreaks. Previous\nstudies over a twenty-year period had shown that the rate of\ntransmission of monkeypox within households was low, suggesting that\nthe disease had a low potential for transmission from person to\nperson. Outbreaks were generally self-limiting after one or two\nsequential transmissions.\nThe percentage of suspect cases from person-to-person transmission\n(78 percent) was higher in this outbreak than previously reported (30\npercent). This was associated with the clustering of cases in\nhousehold compounds and prolonged chains of transmission from person\nto person;\nThe ending of vaccination programmes against smallpox in the late\n1970s has probably led to an increase in susceptibility to monkeypox\nand could explain the larger size of the most recent outbreak, the\nhigher proportion of patients aged 15 and over, and the spread\nthrough many generations of transmission.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is of course the former\ncountry of Zaire, diferrentiated from Republic of the Congo, the DRC's\nneighbor to the west.\nALARM OVER AN OUTBREAK OF HUMAN MONKEYPOX DISEASE\nThe largest and most complex animal viruses are the poxviruses, among them\nsmallpox and a related virus called monkeypox. Smallpox was ostensibly\neradicated completely in 1979. Monkeypox, however, is far from eradicated.\nUntil recently the disease exhibited minor outbreaks, with the incidence\nbeing quickly damped due to the apparent difficulty of human to human\ntransmission. In these outbreaks, the disease was evidently transmitted by\neating the meat of infected monkeys, squirrels, and rats. Now, however,\nduring the last year, there has been a striking outbreak of 92 cases of\nmonkeypox, all within a few villages in the central part of the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo, and the most troubling aspect is the evidence that the\nrate of human to human transmission may have suddenly increased many-fold\nover what it has been in the past.\nPeter Jahrling, a virologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute\n(MD US) says, 'I hate to be accused of pushing the alarmist button, but for\npractical purposes smallpox is back.' And Ali Khan, a medical\nepidemiologist at the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who\nrecently visited the area of the Congo in question, says, 'I am personally\nconcerned about what would happen if this disease showed up in a major city.'\nHowever, an argument can be made that the natural immunity of the people of\nthe Congo has been compromised by a high incidence of HIV and the\nvicissitudes of armed conflict in the area. (Science 18 July)\n--\nRobert Marshall\n<marshalr@ohsu.EDU>\n\n*****\n[2]\nDate: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 21:56:34 -0400 (EDT)\nFrom: michaeli@netvision.net.il\nI wish to differ from the position which is traditionally expressed by the\nWHO experts concerning the monkeypox threat to humans. I am not at all sure\nthat the monkeypox virus will never change its adaptation to humans and\nbecome a source of real outbreaks among us. Already in the last episode in\nZaire there were reports of human to human spread.

WHO is concerned that the ending of\nvaccination programs for smallpox may have led to the seriousness of the\nlatest outbreak.\nThe study revealed that this outbreak represents the largest cluster of\nmonkeypox cases ever reported, and the proportion of patients that were 15\nyears of age or older (27%) was higher than previously reported (8%). Young\nchildren have been most affected in previous outbreaks. These findings\ncontradict previously accepted findings on the nature of the disease.\nThe investigation Studies over a twenty year period have shown that the rate\nof transmission of monkeypox within households was low, suggesting that the\ndisease had a low potential for transmission from person-to-person and that\nan outbreak could not last long after the first patients recovered. However,\nthe recent study has shown that active cases in February 1997 were linked to\ncases that occurred during the preceding 12 month period. The study also\nrevealed the following:\nThe rate of transmission from person-to-person (73%) was higher than\npreviously reported (30%). This was associated with the clustering of cases\nin household compounds and prolonged chains of transmission from\nperson-to-person.\nThe proportion of deaths (3%) was lower than previously reported (10%).\nThe disease Monkeypox disease closely resembles ordinary forms of smallpox.\nThe viruses causing the two diseases are related and vaccination against\nsmallpox also protects against monkeypox. The emergence of monkeypox does\nnot mean that smallpox, which has been eradicated, is re-emerging.\nAll age groups are affected, but children who have not been vaccinated are\nat the highest risk of death, about a 10% case fatality rate. Most cases\noccur in remote villages of Central and West Africa close to tropical\nrainforests where there is frequent contact with infected animals. Monkeypox\nis usually transmitted to humans from squirrels and primates.\nIn the past, an outbreak of monkeypox would not go very far in the village\nor last long because it did not spread extensively after the first patients\nrecovered. However, what concerns WHO is that the present study indicates\nthat monkeypox disease is changing its pattern of infection in humans. This\noutbreak has a much higher rate of person-to-person transmission than seen\nbefore, and spread through many generations of transmission, thus\nmaintaining the outbreak for more than a year.\nConcern for WHO The ending of vaccination programmes against smallpox in the\nlate 1970's has probably led to an increase in susceptibility to monkeypox\nand could explain the larger size of the outbreak, the higher proportion of\npatients aged 15 and over, and the spread through many generations of\ntransmission. The changing nature of monkeypox disease is of concern to WHO.\nIn the past, before the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox\nvaccination was widespread and protected against both smallpox and\nmonkeypox. Since the eradication of smallpox, vaccination programmes have\nbeen discontinued as recommended by WHO. Though monekypox has been shown to\nnot be a threat to smallpox eradication by studies done throughout the\n1980s, WHO is concerned that monkeypox could pose a localized public health\nproblem. WHO will therefore continue to maintain vigilance by strengthening\ndetection systems for monkeypox and completely investigating future\noutbreaks so that the best strategy for prevention and control may be\ndeveloped.\n\nNOTES CONCERNING THIS SERVICE:\nThe Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) serves as an essential\ninstrument for the rapid and accurate dissemination of\nepidemiological information on cases and outbreaks of diseases\nunder the International Health Regulations, other communicable\ndiseases of public health importance, including the newly\nemerging or re-emerging infections, non-communicable diseases\nand other health problems.

The recent outbreak indicates that the rate of person-to-person\ntransmission of monkeypox (constituting 70% of cases) is significantly\ngreater than previous reports, probably attributable to a population with\ndeclining vaccinia immunity. Successful vaccinia virus immunization, as\njudged by the presence of a preexisting vaccination scar, affords\napproximately 85% protection against monkeypox.\nIf a traveller to Zaire remains in Kinshasa, I suspect that he/she will be\nmore at risk from stray bullets from the civil war than from poxviruses.\nHowever, if he/she will be involved in the trapping of squirrels (the\nprincipal animal reservoir of the virus) or medical care in the Kasai\nOriental region, I would suggest that vaccination should be given strong\nconsideration. It is correct to point out that vaccination does carry the\nrisk of adverse reactions, as documented by the Centers for Disease Control\nin 1968. However, some of these adverse reactions (e.g., secondary\ninoculation) would be less common among adults who have a measure of residual\nvaccinia immunity and would have a 'secondary or accelerated take'\n(vaccination of infants/toddlers gradually ceased in the U.S. circa 1971-72),\nand who could practice better contact precautions than the toddlers who\nconstituted the majority of primary vaccinees during the 1960's. The\ncontraindications to vaccination should be carefully noted: pregnancy;\naltered immunocompetence, HIV infection, history of eczema or presence of\nother acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin disease. Furthermore, vaccinia\nshould not be administered to persons who have household contacts with any of\nthe aforementioned conditions.\nIn the U.S., requests for Wyeth Dryvax (the remaining licensed vaccinia\nvaccine in this country) should be addressed to the CDC Drug Service D-09,\n1600 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30333, (404) 639-3670.\nThis experience with Wyeth (Dryvax) and other vaccinia vaccines of similar\nnature indicates that reactions for persons receiving their first smallpox\nvaccination notably included accidental secondary inoculation (of the virus\nto other sites on oneself or to other persons, occurring ~6/10,000\nvaccinations), and generalized vaccinia (viremic dissemination to produce\nskin and mucous membrane lesions away from the primary vaccination site,\n~3/10,000 vaccinations). Serious and life-threatening complications\nincluded: eczema vaccinatum (spread of virus from the vaccination site to\nskin previously affected by eczema or other chronic skin disorder, resulting\nin severe skin inflammation, with a rate of ~30/1 million vaccinations);\npostvaccinial encephalitis (< 9/1 million vaccinations); and vaccinia necrosum\n(progressive tissue necrosis at the inoculation site with spread of the virus\nthroughout the skin and internal organs, occurring < 2/1 million\nvaccinations).
