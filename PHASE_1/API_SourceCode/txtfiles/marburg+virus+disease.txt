How filoviruses establish testicular persistence and are shed in semen remains unknown. We discovered that persistent MARV infection of seminiferous tubules, an immune-privileged site that harbors sperm production, is a relatively common event in crab-eating macaques that survived infection after antiviral treatment. Persistence triggers severe testicular damage, including spermatogenic cell depletion and inflammatory cell invasion. MARV mainly persists in Sertoli cells, leading to breakdown of the blood-testis barrier formed by inter-Sertoli cell tight junctions. This disruption is accompanied by local infiltration of immunosuppressive CD4- positive Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells. Our study elucidates cellular events associated with testicular persistence that may promote sexual transmission of filoviruses and suggests that targeting immunosuppression may be warranted to clear filovirus persistence in damaged immune-privileged sites.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nGreg Folkers\nNIAID, USA\n<gfolkers@nih.gov>\n\n[There have been sporadic cases of Marburg in the past and are likely to occur in the future, so persistence of virus in semen with the risk of sexual transmission is epidemiologically important. Sexual transmission of filoviruses such as Marburg and, especially the Ebola viruses, following recovery from the acute infection adds a complication for surveillance and control following outbreaks. The above report describes the factors responsible for virus persistence in testicular tissue. Persistence of Ebola virus in semen is well documented. A New England Journal of Medicine (NEMJ) article titled Molecular Evidence of Sexual Transmission of Ebola Virus (ref.1), reports on the examination of semen and vaginal-secretion samples collected from survivors in Liberia in March and April 2015. The case report describes one case of human-to-human EBOV transmission through sexual contact. A pilot study, also published in the NEMJ, Ebola RNA Persistence in Semen of Ebola Virus Disease Survivors (ref.2) showed Ebola is able to live longer in the testes than previously known. Among the samples, Ebola virus RNA was detected in the semen of 11 of 43 (26 percent) men 7 to 9 months after the onset of disease. The risk of sexual transmission of filoviruses needs to be further investigated in order to issue guidelines for measures needed to avoid transmission.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.- Mate SE, Kugelman JR, Nyenswah TG, et al.

The discovery means Marburg is a threat in west Africa -- where a giant epidemic of Ebola infected 28 000 people and killed 11 000 of them in 2014-2016. The region is crisscrossed by roads and paths and people travel across borders to towns and cities, making it easier to spread outbreaks of infectious disease. Usually outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg are in isolated regions and have been less likely to spread.\n\nThe knowledge that Marburg lives in bats in Sierra Leone can help officials prepare for potential outbreaks, the researchers said. '[A total of 5] Egyptian rousette fruit bats [_Rousettus aegyptiacus_] tested positive for active Marburg virus infection. Scientists caught the bats separately at locations in 3 health districts: Moyamba, Koinadugu and Kono,' the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which led one of the expeditions that found the infected bats, said in a statement. 'There have been no reported cases of people sick with Marburg in Sierra Leone, but the virus's presence in bats means people nearby could be at risk for contracting Marburg virus. Marburg virus is a cousin to Ebola virus that causes a similar, often fatal disease in people.'\n\nBoth Marburg and Ebola are terrifying because, depending on the strain and availability of medical help, they kill as many as 90% of victims. They can cause a hemorrhagic fever that causes internal and external bleeding, as well as severe diarrhea and vomiting that lead to shock.\n\nThe Egyptian fruit bat has been known to carry Marburg. It's a reservoir, meaning the animals can carry and spread a virus, but it doesn't make them sick. Bats are reservoirs for many viruses, including Marburg, rabies and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS).\n\n'We have known for a long time that rousette bats, which carry Marburg virus in other parts of Africa, also live in West Africa. So it's not surprising that we'd find the virus in bats there,' said ecologist Jonathan Towner, who led the CDC team. 'This discovery is an excellent example of how our work can identify a threat and help us warn people of the risk before they get sick.'\n\nIn Uganda a year ago 3 people died in an outbreak of Marburg. in 2005, a large outbreak of Marburg in Angola killed 90% of the 252 people infected.\n\nThere's a large cave full of fruit bats in Uganda where people, including tourists, have caught Marburg [virus]. 'In eastern and central Africa, these bats can roost in colonies of more than 100 000 animals. However, the colonies of Egyptian fruit bats identified in Sierra Leone so far have been much smaller, which may explain why there have not been any known Marburg virus disease outbreaks in this country,' CDC said in a statement.\n\nBats can spread viruses by biting people, but their saliva and guano can also spread the viruses -- for instance, when they forage on fruit that people also gather and eat. People can catch viruses when they hunt and eat bats, as well.\n\nMarburg's relative, Ebola, is more common and may also be spread by bats. The Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa is now fighting a large outbreak of Ebola. At least 549 people have been infected in the outbreak and 326 have died, the World Health Organization said on Thursday [20 Dec 2018]. At least 50 000 people have been vaccinated against the virus, but civil war has made it difficult for health workers to do their jobs. The virus has also spread in towns, making it hard to contain.\n\n[byline: Maggie Fox]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The occurrence of Marburg virus in other countries where the Egyptian rousette fruit bat occurs is not surprising.

This is the 1st time that evidence of active Marburg virus infection has been found in West Africa, and was made before the detection of any known Marburg virus disease illnesses or deaths in people. This fruit-eating bat species is found throughout much of Africa and prefers to roost in subterranean caves and mines.\n\nThese findings were jointly reported to the Government of Sierra Leone by 2 independent research teams, one led by Njala University with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Viral Special Pathogens Branch, and the USAID-PREDICT project led by the University of California, Davis and the University of Makeni.\n\nTo date [21 Dec 2018], 5 Marburg virus-positive Egyptian rousette bats have been detected. These bats were sampled by the 2 teams near caves in 3 different locations including Moyamba, Koinadugu, and Kono districts. These bats are the known reservoir of Marburg virus in east and central Africa with virus detected in bats in Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Kenya, and South Africa.\n\nThe government of Sierra Leone and international partners are engaging district and local communities to convey what is known about Marburg virus, and how to live safely with bats, especially in and around caves and mines. Engagement with local communities has occurred throughout these projects from their initial phases. Meetings with communities to share plans and answer questions about Marburg virus and especially how to reduce the risk of exposure to the Marburg virus and other zoonotic pathogens are ongoing.\n\nThe discovery of Marburg virus in West Africa nearly 2700 km [1678 miles] west of the previously recognized endemic area and prior to any known human cases demonstrates the impact of proactive One Health-based approaches to disease surveillance to discover potential health threats before they spill over from animals to people and initiate disease outbreaks.\n\nA joint scientific publication among the discovery partners is in preparation, but in light of the high-consequence and highly transmissible nature of Marburg virus infection in people, it was determined that rapid public notification was essential.\n\nPeople should not attempt to kill or eradicate bats in response to this discovery. While bats have been implicated as reservoirs for a number of infectious pathogens, they play important roles as providers of ecosystem services through pollination of native and agricultural crops, reduction of insect pests that also spread disease and damage crops, and consumption of mosquitoes and other pests that feed on people and livestock. Killing or disturbing bats in their natural habitat could actually increase the risk of transmission of Marburg virus, as has been seen in Uganda previously (Amman et al. Emerg Infect Dis 2014;20(10):1761-4) and with rabies virus throughout the world.\n\nMarburg virus was co-discovered in Sierra Leone by the Njala University (https:njala.edu.sl) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<www.cdc.gov>) and the UC [University of California] Davis (http://www.onehealthinstitute.net) and the University of Makeni (http://unimak.edu.sl/wordpress), as part of the PREDICT-USAID-funded project (http://www.predict.global).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDr. Aiah Lebbie\nNjala University\nSierra Leone\n<aiahlebbie@gmail.com>\n\nMr. James Bangura\nUniversity of Makeni\nSierra Leone\n<banguraj@gmail.com>\n\nDr. Brian Bird\nDr. Tracey Goldstein\nOne Health Institute\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nUniversity of California Davis\nUSA\n<bhbird@ucdavis.edu>\n<tgoldstein@ucdavis.edu>\n\nDr. Jonathan Towner\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nViral Special Pathogens Branch\nUSA\n<jit8@cdc.gov>\n\n[As mentioned previously, detection of the virus in these bats in Sierra Leone, west Africa, serves as a warning not only in that country and in Uganda, but in other countries where this bat is found.

The Ministry for Health officially declared the outbreak on 19 Oct 2017.\n\nAs of [3 Nov 2017], the 3 cases that have been previously reported (2 confirmed and one probable case, the latter being the index case) have died, thus, resulting in an overall case-fatality rate of 100 percent. The cases were epidemiologically linked and come from one family.\n\nThe 2nd confirmed case travelled to Kenya, prior to his death. Contact tracing and active case search is ongoing in Kween in Kapchorwa district in Uganda, as well as in Kitale district and West Pokot in Kenya. On 4 Nov [2017] a high risk contact of the 2nd confirmed case, a health care worker in Kween developed symptoms and was admitted to the treatment facility in Kween. Additionally, one close contact of the 2nd confirmed case has been reported to have travelled to Kampala [Uganda]. The Kampala City Authority has sent a team to the village she is reported to be visiting to trace this contact and continue 21 days follow-up.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- The Ugandan Ministry of Health continues to proactively respond to the outbreak with support from WHO and partners.\n- Contact tracing is ongoing, as well as active case search in health facilities and at community level. Reported deaths are also investigated for Marburg before burial and suspicious deaths accorded safe and dignified burials.\n- An isolation and treatment unit was set-up in Kapchorwa with logistical support from WHO, UNICEF, and MSF. A complete triage protocol has been implemented.\n- Social mobilization and risk communication are ongoing. With the support from Red Cross volunteers, UNICEF and WHO communication experts, over 4000 community members have received information on MVD.\n- Psychosocial support specialists have been deployed to Kween and counselling sessions are being conducted for family members of the deceased Marburg cases, health workers, and other community members.\n- Guided tours of the Marburg treatment units in Kapchorwa and Kween were organized in order to dispel fear of the treatment center and rumours of wrong practices by healthcare workers that cause death of admitted patients.\n- A cross-border meeting between Uganda and Kenya health authorities is scheduled for 7 Nov 2017 in Kapchorwa, and cross-border surveillance activities are ongoing.\n- Kenya Marburg virus disease outbreak contingency plan and the public health EOC [Emergency Operations Centre] have been activated and preparedness measures have started.\n- 2000 Personal protective equipment sets have been dispatched by WHO and shipped to Trans Nzoia county, Kenya.\n- Blood specimens were collected and have been dispatched to Nairobi's KEMRI [Kenya Medical Research Institute] Laboratory\n- A temporary treatment center (Kaisangat Health Center) has been identified and the Kenya Red Cross Society is recruiting and re-orienting nurses to manage the MVD treatment centre.\n- UNICEF is assisting with communication activities, and community engagement.\n- MSF-France has deployed to support setting up of treatment centres in Uganda (Kapchorwa and Kaproron) and Kenya (Kaisangat).\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\n- Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (case fatality rate: 23-90 percent). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (such as monkeys and fruit bats).\n\nCandidate experimental treatments and vaccine are being reviewed for potential clinical trials.\n\nUganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus (MVD) disease outbreaks. MVD cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during:\n- 2007: 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda district, Western Uganda;\n- 2008: 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda;\n- 2012: 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and\n- 2014: 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi district, Central Uganda.\n\nCurrently, 3 cases have been identified; 2 confirmed and one probable case. The 2nd confirmed case travelled to Kenya prior to his death, but so far no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed outside of Uganda. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response.\n\nThe affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300 km [about 186 mi] northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread.\n\nThese factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nHuman-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids of infected symptomatic persons, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed.\n\nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment.\n\nSurveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones.\n\nRaising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:\n- reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks);\n- reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home;\n- communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centres and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event.

Nat Commun. 2020; 11:510. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8\n\nScientists have detected Marburg virus in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the 1st time the deadly virus has been found in West Africa. A total of 11 Egyptian rousette fruit bats tested positive for active Marburg virus infection. Research teams caught the bats separately in 3 health districts.\n\nThe presence of Marburg virus, a close relative to Ebola virus that also causes hemorrhagic disease in people, was detected in advance of any reported cases of human illness in Sierra Leone. However, the virus's presence in bats means people who live nearby could be at risk for becoming infected. No outbreaks have been reported to date.\n\nThe findings, based on PCR, antibody, and virus isolation data, were officially published today [24 Jan 2020] in the journal Nature Communications. Preliminary findings were announced earlier in December 2018 to ensure rapid notification to the citizens of Sierra Leone and the international health community.\n\nThe paper highlights the value of collaborating with government and key stakeholders across human, animal, and environmental sectors to engage at-risk communities about the discovery, address health concerns, and communicate risk-reduction strategies before recognized spillovers occur.\n\nMarburg virus was detected by projects led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the USAID-funded PREDICT project led by the One Health Institute at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine; Njala University, Sierra Leone; and the University of Makeni, Sierra Leone.\n\n'Finding Marburg virus in bats in Sierra Leone before any known cases in people is a huge success, as public health officials and doctors can now include Marburg virus among the possible causes when diagnosing hemorrhagic fever cases in the region,' said Tracey Goldstein, co-principal investigator and pathogen detection lead for the PREDICT project from the UC Davis One Health Institute.\n\nTo date, there have been 12 known outbreaks of Marburg virus, with the most recent in Uganda in 2017. The largest and deadliest outbreak occurred in Angola in 2005 when 227 people died. Five of the new strains identified among the Marburg-positive bats in Sierra Leone were genetically similar to the strain that caused the outbreak in Angola. This is the 1st time scientists have detected these Angolan-like strains in bats.\n\nThe virus-positive bats were all Egyptian rousette bats, the known reservoir for Marburg virus, which primarily feed on fruit. Infected bats shed the virus in their saliva, urine, and feces. Egyptian rousette bats are known to test-bite fruits, urinate, and defecate where they eat, potentially contaminating fruit or other food sources consumed by other animals or people, particularly children. These bats sometimes serve as a food source for local populations as well. People may be exposed to Marburg virus through bat bites as they catch the bats.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the preliminary findings by the government of Sierra Leone, the PREDICT team worked with government partners, universities, and other key stakeholders to develop and implement evidence-based public health messaging across national, district, and local community levels in Sierra Leone.\n\n'Over a year ago, we worked with our Sierra Leone government colleagues to inform people across the country as fast as possible of this new health risk and remind people not to harm or come in contact with bats,' said Brian Bird from the UC Davis One Health Institute and global lead for Sierra Leone and Multi-Country Ebola operations for PREDICT-USAID.

A total of 31 people became ill, initially laboratory workers followed by several medical personnel and family members who had cared for them; 7 deaths were reported. The 1st people infected had been exposed to imported African green monkeys or their tissues while conducting research. One additional case was diagnosed retrospectively.\n\nThe reservoir host of Marburg virus is the African fruit bat, _Rousettus aegyptiacus_. Fruit bats infected with Marburg virus do not show obvious signs of illness. Primates (including humans) can become infected with Marburg virus, and may develop serious disease with high mortality.\n\nEbola virus is closely related to Marburg virus. 'Ebola viral RNA fragments were found in an oral swab from a greater long-fingered bat (_Miniopterus inflatus_), captured in 2016 in Liberia's Sanniquellie-Mahn district, which borders Guinea. The bat, which lives in many parts of Africa, roosts in caves and feeds on insects. Scientists had previously found 2 other Ebola species in a related insect-eating bat, _M. schreibersii_. However, most other evidence has pointed to fruit bats as the carriers of Ebola Zaire, Epstein says [J Epstein, veterinary epidemiologist at EcoHealth Alliance in New York City and a member of the PREDICT consortium]. 'What it really says to me is that this is a virus that has multiple hosts, and it might be regionally dependent as to which species carries it.'\n\nSupporting the variety of bat hosts for Ebola, the bat implicated in the initiation of the West African Ebola virus outbreak in December 2013 was _Mops condylurus_, long-tailed insect-eating bats, that were previously suspected in an outbreak of the Sudan strain of Ebola virus, which is related to the Zaire strain. - Mod.LK\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nSierra Leone: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nand\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[The initial report of this finding, prior to this publication, was posted by ProMED-mail (Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone (02): bats, additional information 20181223.6221436) when the virus was detected for the 1st time in fruit bats in Sierra Leone. \n\n'Finding Marburg virus in bats in Sierra Leone before any known cases in people is a huge success, as public health officials and doctors can now include Marburg virus among the possible causes when diagnosing hemorrhagic fever cases in the region,' said Tracey Goldstein, co-principal investigator and pathogen detection lead for the PREDICT project from the UC Davis One Health Institute. \n\nSupporting the variety of bat hosts for Ebola, the bat implicated in the initiation of the West African Ebola virus outbreak in December 2013 was _Mops condylurus_, long-tailed insect-eating bats, that were previously suspected in an outbreak of the Sudan strain of Ebola virus, which is related to the Zaire strain. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8\n\nScientists have detected Marburg virus in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the 1st time the deadly virus has been found in West Africa.

This virus is among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans. The incubation period is 2-21 days, and symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Although MVD is rare, it can result in large outbreaks with high case fatality rates (CFR range from 23 - 90 percent). The disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).\n\nIn Uganda, the following MVD outbreaks have been recently documented:\n\n2007: 4 cases, including 2 deaths, in Ibanda District, Western Uganda\n2008: 2 unrelated cases in travelers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda\n2012: 15 cases, including 4 deaths, in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda\n2014: 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The case numbers reported from Uganda are somewhat unclear.

This followed laboratory tests conducted by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) which confirmed on [17 Oct 2017] that one person died of Marburg virus disease, a type of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF).\n\nAs at [19 Oct 2017], only one case has been confirmed. The confirmed case was a 50-year-old female from Chemuron village, Moyok Parish, Moyok sub county, Kween District in Eastern Uganda. She presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) and unfortunately passed on during the night of [11 Oct 2017] at Kapchorwa Hospital, having been referred from Kaproron Health Center IV in Kween district.\n\nPreliminary field investigations indicated that prior to her death; the deceased had nursed her 42-year-old brother, who had died on [25 Sep 2017] with similar signs and symptoms. She had also closely participated in the cultural preparation of the body for burial. The deceased's brother was reported to be a hunter who carried out his activities where there are caves with heavy presence of bats. However, no samples were taken off his body prior to his death.\n\nMarburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the Marburg virus, a rare but severe type of viral hemorrhagic fever which affects both humans and non-human primates like monkeys, baboons. The reservoir host of Marburg virus is the African fruit bat [Egyptian fruit bat _Rousettus aegyptiacus_]. Fruit bats infected with Marburg virus do not show obvious signs of illness. Primates (including humans) are vulnerable to contracting the Marburg virus, which is known to have a very high mortality.\n\nIn Marburg [virus disease] outbreaks, the 1st person normally gets infected through contact with infected bats or animals (normally monkeys/baboons). Once the 1st person (index case) gets infected with the Marburg virus, human to human transmission of Marburg virus disease (MVD) then occurs through contact with the body fluids (blood, vomitus, urine, feces, etc) of already infected persons. Close contacts to already infected people (like close family members of already infected people) and health workers are particularly at increased risk of getting infected with the Marburg virus.\n\nA person suffering from Marburg [virus disease] presents with sudden onset of high-grade fever accompanied by any of the following symptoms:\n1. Headache\n2. Vomiting blood\n3. Joint and muscle pains\n4. Unexplained bleeding through the body openings including the eyes, nose, gums, ears, anus and the skin.\n\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine available for Marburg [virus disease] for now, but patients are given supportive treatment which supports the natural recovery process of the body and this improves tremendously the patient's survival chances. However, treatment outcomes are better for those who seek care early.\n\nTo mitigate the current threat of Marburg virus disease, the Ministry of Health is undertaking the following measures to control the spread of the disease:\n- Ministry of Health has deployed a Rapid Response Team comprising of highly experienced epidemiologists, risk communication experts, case management, infection control and prevention experts, ecological environmental experts, laboratory specialists, among others to Kween and Kapchorwa districts. The team will support District Rapid Response Teams to investigate and assess the magnitude of the threat and to institute appropriate control measures to avert the Marburg virus disease threat.\n- An isolation ward at the Kapchorwa District Hospital and Kaproron Health Center IV in Kween District has been established to handle cases.\n- Preparations are underway to train all health workers, particularly from Kapchorwa Hospital, and Kaproron Health Centre IV on VHF Infection Prevention and Control. Infection Prevention and Control measures have been heightened in all health facilities in Kapchorwa and Kween districts.\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE's) and other supplies have been mobilized to support response in the affected facilities.\n- The National Medical Stores is delivering emergency supplies to the affected health facilities.\n- Increasing awareness in affected communities and among health-care providers on the clinical symptoms of patients with Marburg virus disease.\n\nMarburg virus disease has the potential to spread over wide areas affecting many people especially health workers and family members nursing Marburg viral disease patients.\n\nThe Ministry of Health therefore appeals to the general public to remain alert and observe the following precautions to control the spread of the Marburg virus:\n- Report any suspected patient immediately to a nearby health facility.\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids of a person presenting with bleeding tendencies or symptoms suggestive of Marburg virus disease.\n- Health workers are further reminded to wear gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment when taking care of ill patients or suspected cases.\n- Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.\n- Avoid contact with persons who have died from the disease.\n- Allow health workers perform dignified burials among victims who might have succumbed to the disease, so as to minimise its spread to others.\n\nThe Ministry of Health calls upon the general public to remain calm but be on alert amidst this epidemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nJas' Mantero, MD MPH PhD\n<jasmantero@gmail.com>\n\n[Cases of Marburg virus infection have occurred sporadically in Uganda over several years.

All the contacts are still in a healthy condition,' Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, director general for health services in Uganda, said in the latest update on the outbreak on Tuesday.\n\n'The National Taskforce through the field epidemiologists and surveillance officers continues to closely monitor all people who got into contact with this confirmed case,' she noted.\n\nThe dead health worker was a radiographer in a hospital in the capital of Kampala and also at Mpigi District Health Center IV, places where authorities say he made contact with colleagues.\n\nAceng revealed that at least 11 people have tested negative after results from Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) indicate that although the suspects had developed signs and symptoms similar to that of the disease, they did not contract the virus.\n\n'However, for those who continue to have signs, tests will be run again after 3 days,' Aceng said.\n\nAmong those who tested negative include are the brother of the deceased; 2 health workers from a children HIV/AIDS hospital; 7 persons from Mpigi Health Center IV; and 2 relatives of the deceased who participated in the burial.\n\n'When he felt ill on [17 Sep 2014], he traveled back to Mpigi for treatment since he felt more comfortable with a facility that he had worked with for a long time, a duration the disease was spread,' said a statement by health authorities last Sunday.\n\nMarburg virus was 1st identified in 1967, when 31 people became sick in Germany and Yugoslavia in an outbreak that was eventually traced back to laboratory monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then the virus has appeared sporadically, with just a dozen outbreaks on record, many -- including the current situation -- involving just a single patient.\n\nMarburg virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, beginning with fever and weakness and often leading to internal or external bleeding, organ failure and death. The death rate runs as high as 80 percent, although it was significantly lower in the initial outbreak when patients were cared for in relatively modern, European hospitals.\n\nThe most recent outbreak, also in Uganda, in 2012, killed 4 out of 15 patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOn Tuesday [7 Oct 2014], CDC Director Thomas Frieden pointed to the most recent Marburg case as an example of how a deadly virus could be contained.\n\n'We've done important work in Uganda to help the Ugandans better have a laboratory network so they can find cases, have a response network with disease detectives who can follow up and have an emergency operations center to trace individual cases,' Frieden said.\n\nThe extensive contact tracing included tracking an embalmer back to Kenya, where he was tested and found not to be infected with Marburg.\n\n'I mention this, because oftentimes in public health, what gets noticed is what happens and it's hard to see what doesn't happen,' Frieden continued, noting that there have so far been no additional cases. 'That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa.'\n\n[Byline: Samson Ntale]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Fortunately, none of at least 11 suspected cases have confirmed Marburg infection, according to the above media report. It has not yet been 21 days, the maximum expected incubation period for Marburg virus disease, since the index patient's death on 28 Sep 2014, so it is too early to declare victory. Nonetheless, it is encouraging that no new cases have emerged, attributable, as Dr. Frieden stated, to good public health, the nature of Marburg virus disease (which has resulted in generally smaller outbreaks than Ebola virus) and perhaps some good luck. - Mod.LM\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nMore than 60 health workers form the bulk of people under isolation after they were identified as having contact with a 30-year old male health worker who died [28 Sep 2014] of Marburg -- an Ebola-like hemorrhagic fever.

He was reported to have developed fever, headache, general body weakness and dizziness 4 days ago (around Fri 11 Oct 2014). A blood sample was taken to UVRI for laboratory investigation. Line listing of contacts is ongoing. 79 out of 93 (85 percent) of contacts were followed up, only one was reported ill as mentioned above.\n- The alert case that was reported by a doctor in Mengo hospital on 12 Oct 2014 was not traced.

NTF agreed that all patients should go through Triage at Mulago assessment center, and only cases meeting Marburg case definition should be referred to isolation facility. The rest should be given good medical care.\nMpigi\n- A probable case admitted on 14 Oct 2014 is being monitored at Mpigi HC IV. Blood sample tested was negative for malaria, brucellosis, and typhoid.\n- Turn up of patients at Mpigi HCIV has increased as the health workers also increase following their completion of the 21 days.\n- There is urgent need to equip lower level health facilities with information, some PPEs and other supplies to enable them to confidently manage alert cases.\nKasese\n- Currently, no patient is admitted in the isolation unit.\n- MOH, WHO and Makerere University School of Public Health conducted a training of health workers on VHF preparedness, response and case management and infection prevention and control.

The case presented to Mpigi District Health Center on 17 Sep 2014, and transferred to Mengo Hospital, Kampala, on 23 Sep 2014. On admission the case presented with symptoms including fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, and died on 28 Sep 2014.\n\nThe case reported no history of travel beyond Mpigi, no contact with a person with similar illness. He had not eaten bush meat nor had had contact with bats in the last 4 weeks.\n\nA preliminary result indicating the specimen taken from the patient was positive for Marburg virus disease was received on 3 Oct 2014, and further confirmed on 4 Oct 2014 by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).\n\nAs of today [10 Oct 2014], a total of 146 contacts have been identified and are being monitored for signs and symptoms compatible with MVD. 11 of the contacts developed signs and symptoms compatible with Marburg virus disease. All samples from symptomatic contacts have tested negative so far. 2nd samples have been taken from them and are being tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). One contact, Kenyan mortician who travelled back to Kenya, developed a fever and cough but tested negative for both Marburg and Ebola virus. The contact in Kenya continues to be followed up by the Kenyan Rapid Response Team.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe Ministry of Health of Uganda has activated the National Task Force, which is meeting regularly, and sub-committees have been established.\n\nWHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are supporting the national Ugandan authorities in the investigation and response operations, including enhancements and establishment of isolation and treatment units, prepositioning personal protective equipment (PPE), and training health workers on infection control and prevention, as well as in case management and social mobilization.\n\nFour multi-disciplinary teams have been deployed to perform an in-depth risk assessment. Surveillance and contact tracing, and follow-up activities are currently being implemented in Kampala, Mpigi and Kasese.\n\nWHO recommendations\n-------------------\nMarburg virus disease is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by a virus from the same family as the one that causes Ebola virus disease. Both viruses can cause large outbreaks such as the ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. The last outbreak of MVD in Uganda occurred in 2012, during which 20 cases, including 9 fatal cases, were reported from Kabale District, Kampala, Ibanda, Mbarara, and Kabarole.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda based on the current information available on this outbreak.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-EAFR\n<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>\n\n[To quote Mod.JFW's commentary:\n'The detection of the initial Marburg virus disease in the current outbreak in Uganda shows a sensitive disease surveillance system that has been tested several times previously and hence the vigilance in detecting, reporting, and investigating suspect viral hemorrhagic fever cases. However, since the initial case reported in the current outbreak is a health care worker, this suggests nosocomial exposure to a source case that has not been identified. Epidemiological investigations should therefore focus on identifying the source case as this could possibly represent another chain of transmission that is yet to be identified.\n\nMaps of Uganda can be accessed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2470.'\n\nIt is certainly possible that the only known case in the current event, a healthcare worker, was not the index case.

As of 28 Oct 2012, a total of 18 cases and 9 deaths, including a health worker, have been reported from 5 districts namely Kabale district, in southwestern Uganda, Kampala (the capital city), Ibanda, Mbarara, and Kabarole. 9 of the cases are laboratory confirmed. This represents a case-fatality rate of 50 percent. Currently, 13 patients have been admitted to hospital (2 in Kampala, 8 in Kabale, 3 in Ibanda) and their contacts are listed for daily follow up.\n\nThe CDC notes that the city of Kabale is often a stopping point for tourists visiting both Lake Bunyonyi and the Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable National Parks, which are famous for mountain gorilla tracking. Although health officials are not recommending any travel restrictions at this time, and the risk for travelers is low, they do offer the following recommendations for travelers to protect themselves from Marburg [virus disease]:\n\n- Practice good hygiene. Avoid contact with blood and body fluids of infected people. Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids.\n- Avoid contact with bats, such as entering bat caves.\n- Avoid contact with other animals, especially monkeys.\n\nSymptoms of Marburg virus infection include headache; muscle aches; rash on the chest, back, or stomach; nausea; vomiting; chest pain; sore throat; abdominal pain; and diarrhea. Severe symptoms include jaundice, severe weight loss, shock, massive internal bleeding, and failure of multiple internal organs.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] CDC travel notice\nDate: Mon 5 Nov 2012\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Travelers' Health [edited]\nhttp://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/in-the-news/marburg-uganda-2012.htm\n\n\nTravel notice -- Uganda\n-----------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\n------------------------------\nThe Ugandan Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in the Kitumba subcounty of the Kabale and Ibanda Districts in southwestern Uganda. As of 28 Oct 2012, 18 cases and 9 deaths have been reported. 9 of the cases are laboratory confirmed.\n\nThe city of Kabale is within several miles of the outbreak. Kabale is often a stopping point for people visiting both Lake Bunyonyi and the Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable National Parks, which are famous for mountain gorilla tracking. This city is also a transportation hub, with roads leading to both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. CDC is working closely with the Ugandan MOH and the World Health Organization (WHO) to control the outbreak. CDC does not recommend any travel restrictions at this time.\n\nWhat is Marburg virus disease?\n--------------------------\nMarburg hemorrhagic fever (Marburg HF), [more precisely, Marburg virus disease], is a rare and deadly disease. The virus that causes Marburg HF is thought to be carried by African fruit bats. Scientists do not know exactly how the virus is spread from bats to humans. People have become infected by touching fluids or blood of infected people or infected monkeys. People in close contact with people who have the virus are at highest risk.\n\nSymptoms include fever; headache; muscle aches; rash on the chest, back, or stomach; nausea; vomiting; chest pain; sore throat; abdominal pain; and diarrhea. Severe symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), severe weight loss, shock, massive internal bleeding, and failure of multiple internal organs.\n\nHow can travelers protect themselves?\n-------------------------------------\nThere is no vaccine to prevent Marburg [virus disease] and no specific treatment for people who become ill. Although travelers are at low risk for the disease, it is important to take steps to prevent Marburg HF.\n\n- Practice good hygiene. Avoid contact with blood and body fluids of infected people. Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids.\n- Avoid contact with bats, such as entering bat caves.\n- Avoid contact with other animals, especially monkeys.\n\nHealth care workers who may be exposed to people with the disease should follow these steps:\n\n- Wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles.\n- Practice proper infection control and sterilization measures. For more information, see Infection Control for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers in the African Health Care Setting at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm).\n- Isolate Marburg [virus disease] patients from unprotected persons. Also avoid direct contact with the bodies of infected deceased patients.\n\nClinician information\n---------------------\nMarburg virus disease infection is a notifiable condition in the USA. If a person with travel history to affected areas has the symptoms described above and infection with Marburg virus is suspected, isolate the patient and notify local and state health departments and CDC.\n\nAntigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing, IgM-capture ELISA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and virus isolation can be used to confirm a case of Marburg [virus disease] within a few days of the onset of symptoms. The IgG-capture ELISA is appropriate for testing persons later in the course of disease or after recovery. The disease is readily diagnosed by immunohistochemistry, virus isolation, or PCR of blood or tissue specimens from deceased patients.\n\nThere is no standard treatment for Marburg [virus disease]. Patients receive supportive therapy that consists of balancing the patient's fluids and electrolytes, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure, and treating them for any complicating infections.\n\nAdditional information\n----------------------\nMarburg Hemorrhagic Fever (CDC Viral Special Pathogens Branch):\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/marburg/qa.htm\nViral Hemorrhagic Fevers (CDC Yellow Book):\nhttp://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/viral-hemorrhagic-fevers.htm\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The case numbers remain unchanged from the last listing from Uganda.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Uganda can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/3LUA.\n\nA directory listing the locations and populations of settlements in Kabale District of Uganda can be accessed at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/UG/34/. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \nWith the Marburg virus disease outbreak spreading in Uganda, now being reported from 5 districts in the African country, [U.S.] federal health officials have issued an advisory for travelers to Uganda, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel notice [dated 2 Nov 2012; see below]\n\nThe Uganda Ministry of Health officially declared an outbreak on 19 Oct 2012.

[Authors: Amman BR, Carroll SA, Reed ZD, Sealy TK, Balinandi S, et al.]\n\nAbstract:\n-----------\nMarburg virus (family _Filoviridae_) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Bats have been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in 2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected _Rousettus aegyptiacus_ fruit bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40 000 _R. aegyptiacus_ were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present.\n\nBetween August 2008 and November 2009, 1622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated about 2.5 percent of the bats were actively infected, 7 of which yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for _R. aegyptiacus_ tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (about 6 months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83 percent (54/65) of events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of 2 tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with _R. aegyptiacus_ bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges. These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg virus disease risk reduction strategies.\n\nAuthor Summary:\n--------------\nMarburg virus, like its close relative Ebola virus, can cause large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with case fatalities nearing 90 percent. For decades, the identity of the natural reservoir was unknown. However, in 2007, Marburg viruses were isolated directly from Egyptian fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) that inhabited a Ugandan gold mine where miners were previously infected. Soon after, 2 tourists became infected with Marburg virus after visiting nearby Python Cave, a popular attraction in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. This cave also contained _R. aegyptiacus_ bats (around 40 000 animals). These events prompted a long-term investigation of Python Cave to determine if, 1) _R. aegyptiacus_ in the cave carried infectious Marburg virus genetically similar to that found in the tourists, and 2) [to determine] what ecological factors might influence virus spillover to humans. In the study, we found that, 1) approximately 2.5 percent of the bat colony is actively infected at any one time and that virus isolates from bats are genetically similar to those from infected tourists, and 2) specific age groups of bats (juveniles around 6 months of age) are particularly likely to be infected at specific times of the year that roughly coincide with historical dates of Marburg virus spillover into humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interested readers should read the full account of this research via the source URL>.\n\nThe above research further implicates fruit bats as the source of the virus responsible for the sporadic outbreaks of the highly lethal Marburg virus in the human populations of West Africa.

According to the reports, the patients presented with symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, headache, dizziness, and generalized convulsions. Initial samples of blood and cerebral spiral fluid taken from the sick people ruled out malaria and meningitis. The family then invited a cult leader, a retired Reverend from Rukungiri district, to visit their household and pray for the sick. The index case is believed to have been a member of a family in Rwabirondo village, Kitumba parish in Kitumba sub-county, which occurred on 20 Sep 2012. After the death of the index case, 2 other people, a sister and mother reportedly got sick and died. This outbreak comes barely 2 weeks after the Ministry declared an end to another viral haemorrhagic fever (Ebola virus disease) on 4 Oct 2012. The last Marburg outbreak [occurred] in October 2007 in Kamwenge district.\n\nMarburg is a highly infectious viral haemorrhagic fever, which kills in a short time but can be prevented [avoided?]. Marburg virus infection is spread through direct contact with body fluids like blood, saliva, vomit, stool, and urine of an infected person. A person suffering from Marburg virus disease presents with sudden onset of high fever with any of the following; headache, vomiting blood, joint and muscle pains, and bleeding through the body openings, that is, eyes (red eyes), nose, gums, ears, anus, and the skin. Virus can be spread also through use of unsterilised injection syringes, contaminated linen, beddings, and clothes; by the use of skin piercing instruments that have been used by an infected person. And also by direct physical handling of persons who have died of Marburg virus disease.\n\nCurrent situation\n-----------------\n- Of the 6 people who have died so far, only 3 [have been] confirmed positive for Marburg virus infection.\n- Currently, there is only one confirmed case admitted in our isolation facility at Mulago National Referral Hospital. The patient admitted [there] is from Kitumba sub-county and is a relative of the index case.\n- One convalescent case is detained at Rushoroza Health Center III, while 5 suspect cases linked to the initial cases have ben admitted there awaiting the results of diagnostic tests. Special teams of doctors and nurses have been assigned to attend to the patients in both isolation facilities.\n- The Ministry of Health surveillance team has listed a total of 196 contacts for close monitoring. These contacts are mainly in Kabale, Rukungiri, and Ibanda districts while 29 are from Kampala. Those being monitored reportedly got into contact with either the dead or confirmed cases. The team continues to monitor them on a daily basis for possible signs and symptoms of this highly infectious disease until they have completed 10 days without showing any signs and symptoms.\n- A team of experts from the Ministry of Health, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation have so far collected a total of 18 samples from suspected cases for further investigations. The samples are being analyzed at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe.\n- The Ministry is conducting an orientation of local healthcare workers in Kabale Regional Referral Hospital and in the other peripheral health facilities on infection prevention and control, barrier nursing, surveillance, and clinical case management. This is being done to build health workers' capacity to handle such cases.\n- In Rushoroza Health Centre, a burial committee has been set up to manage burials of people suspected to have died of Marburg virus disease. The committee has been oriented on burial procedures and infection prevention and control. This is one of the control measures to curb the spread of the highly contiguous disease. The committee has so far supervised 2 burials.\n- A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected in the country to undertake anthropological [sic; epidemiological?] studies.\n\nThe Ministry of Health once again urges the public to take the following measures to avert the spread of the disease.\n- Report immediately any suspected patient to a nearby health unit\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids of a person suspected to be suffering from Marburg virus disease by using protective materials like gloves and masks\n- Persons who have died of Marburg virus disease must be handled with strong protective wear and buried immediately\n- Avoid eating dead animals [sic; presumably animals that died of disease]\n- Avoid unnecessary public gatherings especially in the affected district\n- Burial of suspicious community deaths should be done under close supervision of well trained burial teams\n- Report all suspicious deaths to a nearby health facility.\n\nOnce again the Ministry of Health calls upon the public to stay calm, as all possible measures are being undertaken to control the situation.\n\nHon Dr Christine Ondoa\nUgandan Minister of Health\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The situation remains confused and hopefully will be clarified soon as the investigation of the outbreak gets underway.

The death occurred in Bukora Kitumba sub-county in Kabale district. 'It's sad the 5th person has died because the emergency team delayed to reach Kabale on Friday [19 Oct 2012]', according to Patrick Besigye Keihwa, the Kabale District Chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergency team dispatched to deal with the outbreak has arrived in Kabale. The team will be conducting burials and managing an emergency zone to treat people. Efforts are also underway to track all people who had had contact with the victims, the government said. The authorities urged the public to avoid direct bodily contact with a person suffering from Marburg virus disease and unnecessary public gatherings.\n\nMarburg virus disease, also known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever is transmitted through bodily fluids such as saliva and blood, or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys. The disease [is caused by a virus belonging] to the same family of viruses as Ebola virus [the family _Filoviridae_], starts with severe headache and leads to haemorrhaging and, in previous outbreaks in Africa, to death in 80 percent or more of cases, usually within 8 to 9 days.\n\nThe last outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Uganda occurred in 2007 and killed 2 miners in the west of the country. The latest outbreak comes after at least 16 people died from Ebola virus disease in August [2012]. In 2000, 425 people contracted Ebola virus disease in Uganda and more than half of them died.\n\nA major outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurred among gold miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000, causing 128 deaths out of 154 cases. An outbreak in Angola in 2004-05 killed 150 people out of 163 cases, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n[Byline: Goodluck Musinguzi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n****\n[2]\nDate: Fri 19 Oct 2012\nSource: eTN Global Travel Industry News [edited]\nhttp://www.eturbonews.com/31810/refugees-congo-suspected-have-brought-marburg-uganda\n\n\nRefugees from Congo suspected to have brought Marburg to Uganda\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAccording to emerging reports from Southwestern Uganda, there is increasing suspicion of an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus disease, and affected individuals have been tested and put into a full quarantine. A team of health officials is on the ground, assisted reportedly by security personnel, combing areas where refugees have sought shelter to identify anyone displaying symptoms in line with the early signs of the disease.\n\nOnly 2 weeks ago, Uganda was declared free Ebola virus disease, after an outbreak, also suspected to have been brought into Uganda from the Eastern Congo, which [was responsible for the deaths of] patients and health workers. Marburg virus disease falls into the same category of virus diseases as Ebola virus disease, and while less virulent, is still known to be a disease with a high percentage of fatalities.\n\nDiseases in Congo's rain forests are common but normally contained within a small radius of one or 2 communities. But with the lack of health care structures in that part of the [Democratic Republic of Congo], where at the moment intense fighting is going on, it makes refugees often the main carriers to bring such disease across the border into Uganda, where a much better-equipped health care infrastructure is then compelled to deal with the unwanted 'imports.'\n\nThe local media in Kampala is now starting to pick up on the news, which almost inevitably started to emerge on Twitter as individuals on the ground sent messages out, which were then picked up and retweeted.\n\nThe outbreak comes on the day prior to Uganda's National Bird Watching contest, with the opening ceremony taking place this afternoon at the Uganda Museum in Kampala from where the participating teams were to leave for their chosen locations upcountry and in the national parks.\n\nA full statement is expected later today [19 Oct 2012] from the Ministry of Health, but the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe has reportedly confirmed that [the causative agent] is Marburg virus, prompting widespread containment measures now unfolding around the affected areas between Kabale and Kisoro.\n\n[Byline: Dr. Wolfgang H.

Kabale District has a common border with Rwanda, but is not directly adjacent to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which lies further to the west. So refugees would have to transit another Ugandan district which has not yet reported Marburg virus disease.\n\nTransmission of the virus from person-to-person requires close contact with a patient. Transmission does not occur during the incubation period 3 to 9 days). Infection results from contact with blood or other body fluids (faeces, vomitus, urine, saliva, and respiratory secretions) with high virus concentration, especially when these fluids contain blood. Transmission via infected semen can occur; virus has been detected in semen up to 7 weeks after clinical recovery.\n\nPatients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses, and are most infectious during the phase of severe illness. Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease, rapid deterioration, and possibly higher fatality.
