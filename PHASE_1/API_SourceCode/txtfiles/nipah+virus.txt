Kerala health minister KK Shailaja congratulated the medical team at the hospital for successfully handling the Nipah case. KK Shailaja on Tuesday [23 Jul 2019] officially declared the district Nipah-free.\n\nThe Aster Medcity had borne all expenses of the Nipah patient. On 4 Jun [2019], Pune's National Institute of Virology confirmed that the 23-year old youth had contracted the Nipah virus. The youth was admitted to hospital on 30 May [2019] and was in no condition to stand on his feet. He has now completely recovered.\n\nA year ago, the Nipah virus had claimed 18 lives in Kozhikode, Kerala. Unlike last year [2018], no loss of life has been reported so far in 2019. Health minister KK Shailaja is expected to be present during the discharge of the youth.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Institute of Virology has identified the presence of the deadly Nipah virus in 12 fruit bats out of the 36 samples tested at the institute. The medical department had collected hundreds of sputum samples of fruit bats from different parts of Kerala.\n\nTraining on preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus was imparted to 1293 persons in the state. The labour department inspected 12 migrant labour camps at North Paravur, Perumbavur, and Kakkanad areas to ensure hygiene standards were met. Strict action will be taken against those found violating hygiene norms, a health department official had said.\n\nAccordingly, training that was imparted at the block level as part of a Nipah vigil will cover gram panchayats and municipalities. The workers of Asha, Anganwadi, Kudumbasree, and NREGP also received training.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is good to learn that the young man has completely recovered from his Nipah virus infection and has been discharged from the hospital. His is the 2nd case of Nipah virus infection [NVI] in Kerala state this year (2019). Last year (2018), as of 17 Jul 2018, a total of 19 Nipah virus (NiV) cases, including 17 deaths, were reported from Kerala state: 18 of the cases were laboratory confirmed, and the deceased index case was suspected to have NVI but could not be tested. The 2018 outbreak was localized to 2 districts in Kerala state: Kozhikode and Malappuram. The exact circumstances under which this or the previous confirmed Nipah virus index case acquired their infections are not stated in the above or in previous reports, nor is it stated whether these individuals had contact with flying fox fruit bats (_Pteropus giganteus_), the reservoir hosts of Nipah virus, or fruit that the bats may have contaminated. It is interesting to note that 12 of 36 fruit bats tested at the National Institute of Virology were positive for Nipah virus. Although Kerala health minister KK Shailaja officially declared Ernakulam district Nipah-free, it may be free of human cases currently but is unlikely to be free of the virus in _Pteropus giganteus_ fruit bats.\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/308. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nNipah virus - India (07): (KL) bats 20190625.6537880\nNipah virus - India (06): (KL) susp. 20190620.6531055\nNipah virus - India (05): (MP) bats, suspected 20190619.6528698\nNipah virus - India (04): (KL) 20190617.65254692016\nNipah virus - India (03): (KL) 20190608.6509946\nNipah virus - India (02): (KL) Ministry press release 20190606.6507249\nNipah virus - India: (KL) 20190606.6506261\n2018\n----\nNipah virus - India (17): (KL) WHO 20180809.5956295\nNipah virus - India (16): (KL) review 20180717.5909148\nNipah virus - India (15): (AS, WB) fruit bats 20180710.5897455\nNipah virus - India (14): (KL) 20180704.5887151\nNipah virus - India (13): (KL) 20180611.5851326\nNipah virus - India (12) 20180603.5836554\nNipah virus - India (11): (KL) 20180602.5835342\nNipah virus - India (10): (KL) 20180602.5833137\nNipah virus - India (09): (WB ex KL) susp. 20180530.5829184\nNipah virus - India (08): (KR ex KL) susp. 20180529.5826769\nNipah virus - India (07) 20180528.5822566\nNipah virus - India (06): (KL,KA) 20180526.5819777\nNipah virus - India (05): (KL,TG) 20180525.5817917\nNipah virus - India (04): (KL, KA) 20180524.5815473\nNipah virus - India (03): (KL) conf. 20180522.5812214\nNipah virus - India (02): (KL) conf. 20180521.5809003\nNipah virus - India: (KL) susp. 20180521.5807513\n.................................................ml/ty/tw/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["nipah virus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-30 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "1293-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-07-17 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Kozhikode", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "KA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kudumbasree", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7488567", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Nipah virus - India: (KL) corr", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7488567", "date": "2019-07-25 18:32:51", "main_text": "NIPAH VIRUS - INDIA (08): (KERALA)\n**********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 24 Jul 2019\nSource: My Nation [edited]\nhttps://www.mynation.com/india-news/kerala-nipah-survivor-leaves-hospital-ernakulam-declared-free-from-deadly-virus-pv4sol\n\n\nAfter 53 days, a 23-year-old Nipah patient hailing from Ernakulam was discharged from Kochi Aster Medcity on Tuesday [23 Jul 2019].

Science Translational Medicine 2019: 11; 494, eaau9242, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aau9242\n\nAbstract\n--------\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen in the _Paramyxoviridae_ family. Upon transmission of Nipah virus from its natural reservoir, _Pteropus_ spp. fruit bats, to humans, it causes respiratory and neurological disease with a case fatality rate about 70%. Human-to-human transmission has been observed during Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. A therapeutic treatment for Nipah virus disease is urgently needed. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734), a broad-acting antiviral nucleotide prodrug, against Nipah virus Bangladesh genotype in African green monkeys. Animals were inoculated with a lethal dose of Nipah virus, and a once-daily intravenous remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 hours later and continued for 12 days. Mild respiratory signs were observed in 2 of 4 treated animals, whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease signs. In contrast to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remsdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection.\n\nIntroduction [abridged]\n-----------------------\nNipah virus causes severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans (1). The recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India, involving 23 cases and 21 deaths (2), again stressed the urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against Nipah virus. The World Health Organization has listed Nipah virus as an emerging pathogen likely to cause major epidemics or even pandemics (3). Very few antivirals have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Nipah virus disease.\n\nDiscussion [abridged]\n---------------------\nAlthough histologic evidence of meningoencephalitis was seen in one of 4 remdesivir-treated animals, remdesivir is distributed to the brain upon intravenous administration (15), and thus, remdesivir treatment may be reinitiated in cases of late-onset or relapse Nipah virus encephalitis. Intravenous remdesivir treatment was administered to a patient with acute Ebola virus meningitis that developed 9 months after the initial discharge (16), and a similar approach could potentially be used in late-onset or relapse encephalitis cases of Nipah virus infection. Remdesivir is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial in Liberia and Guinea to determine whether it can affect the persistent Ebola virus shedding in semen of Ebola male survivors (17).

Science Translational Medicine 2019: 11; 494, eaau9242, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aau9242\n\nAbstract\n--------\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen in the _Paramyxoviridae_ family. Upon transmission of Nipah virus from its natural reservoir, _Pteropus_ spp. fruit bats, to humans, it causes respiratory and neurological disease with a case fatality rate about 70%. Human-to-human transmission has been observed during Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. A therapeutic treatment for Nipah virus disease is urgently needed. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734), a broad-acting antiviral nucleotide prodrug, against Nipah virus Bangladesh genotype in African green monkeys. Animals were inoculated with a lethal dose of Nipah virus, and a once-daily intravenous remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 hours later and continued for 12 days. Mild respiratory signs were observed in 2 of 4 treated animals, whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease signs. In contrast to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remsdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection.\n\nIntroduction [abridged]\n-----------------------\nNipah virus causes severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans (1). The recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India, involving 23 cases and 21 deaths (2), again stressed the urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against Nipah virus. The World Health Organization has listed Nipah virus as an emerging pathogen likely to cause major epidemics or even pandemics (3). Very few antivirals have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Nipah virus disease.\n\nDiscussion [abridged]\n---------------------\nAlthough histologic evidence of meningoencephalitis was seen in one of 4 remdesivir-treated animals, remdesivir is distributed to the brain upon intravenous administration (15), and thus, remdesivir treatment may be reinitiated in cases of late-onset or relapse Nipah virus encephalitis. Intravenous remdesivir treatment was administered to a patient with acute Ebola virus meningitis that developed 9 months after the initial discharge (16), and a similar approach could potentially be used in late-onset or relapse encephalitis cases of Nipah virus infection. Remdesivir is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial in Liberia and Guinea to determine whether it can affect the persistent Ebola virus shedding in semen of Ebola male survivors (17). Likewise, treating survivors of Nipah virus infection with remdesivir could be considered to aid in completely clearing the virus, thereby preventing future relapses.

Science Translational Medicine 2019: 11; 494, eaau9242, DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aau9242\n\nAbstract\n--------\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen in the _Paramyxoviridae_ family. Upon transmission of Nipah virus from its natural reservoir, _Pteropus_ spp. fruit bats, to humans, it causes respiratory and neurological disease with a case fatality rate about 70%. Human-to-human transmission has been observed during Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. A therapeutic treatment for Nipah virus disease is urgently needed. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734), a broad-acting antiviral nucleotide prodrug, against Nipah virus Bangladesh genotype in African green monkeys. Animals were inoculated with a lethal dose of Nipah virus, and a once-daily intravenous remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 hours later and continued for 12 days. Mild respiratory signs were observed in 2 of 4 treated animals, whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease signs. In contrast to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remsdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection.\n\nIntroduction [abridged]\n-----------------------\nNipah virus causes severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans (1). The recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, India, involving 23 cases and 21 deaths (2), again stressed the urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against Nipah virus. The World Health Organization has listed Nipah virus as an emerging pathogen likely to cause major epidemics or even pandemics (3). Very few antivirals have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Nipah virus disease.\n\nDiscussion [abridged]\n---------------------\nAlthough histologic evidence of meningoencephalitis was seen in one of 4 remdesivir-treated animals, remdesivir is distributed to the brain upon intravenous administration (15), and thus, remdesivir treatment may be reinitiated in cases of late-onset or relapse Nipah virus encephalitis. Intravenous remdesivir treatment was administered to a patient with acute Ebola virus meningitis that developed 9 months after the initial discharge (16), and a similar approach could potentially be used in late-onset or relapse encephalitis cases of Nipah virus infection. Remdesivir is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial in Liberia and Guinea to determine whether it can affect the persistent Ebola virus shedding in semen of Ebola male survivors (17). Likewise, treating survivors of Nipah virus infection with remdesivir could be considered to aid in completely clearing the virus, thereby preventing future relapses. If our finding of differential neutralizing antibody responses in persistently infected animals versus animals that apparently cleared the virus can be confirmed in human Nipah virus survivors, then a cohort of patients that may benefit from remdesivir treatment may be determined using a standard serological assay.\n\n--\ncommunicated by Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of this limited experiment indicate that further tests are justified and needed.

It will be important to know how long into the infection, drug administration will be effective. Seeking medical attention and treatment very early in the course of an infection may not be practical in the field and limit usefulness of the drug.

Some of his colleagues, who also hail from Assam, admitted Manoj to the hospital, but he lost his battle for life on Sat 2 Jun 2018. He was a worker in one Starboard company in Kerala.\n\nThe wife of MS was informed by the deceased's colleagues about the incident over the telephone on 2 Jun 2018 at around 8:30 am.\n\nAccording to Rinu Gogoi Saikia, her husband went to Kerala from Assam's Lakhimpur district to work in the company just 15 days back.\n\nBefore going to Kerala, MS, who was residing in his relatives' house at Dihingia village in Dhemaji's Gogamukh [Kerala], was working as a driver for few years at Gogamukh.\n\nSince 1998 to 2015, more than 600 cases of Nipah virus human infections have been reported. Subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh have occurred with high fatality rates.\n\nThe 1st identification of Nipah virus as a cause of an outbreak of encephalitis [in South Asia] was reported in 2001 in Meherpur district of Bangladesh.

However, if travellers wish to be extra cautious, they may avoid the 4 districts\", Health Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan said.\n\nThe government has also called for an all-party meeting at Kozhikode on [Fri 25 May [2018] to discuss the issue. MPs, MLAs, other representatives of people and leaders of various political parties would attend the meeting, Health minister K K Shylaja said.\n\nIn Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, 10 people have lost their lives to Nipah so far and 19 are undergoing treatment in various hospitals, including one in Waynad. Of the 13 confirmed cases, 10 people have died.\n\nIsolation wards have also been set up in Thalassery government hospital in Kannur, according to media reports.\n\nIn Kozhikode, from where 7 deaths have been reported, District Collector U V Jose has ordered temporary stoppage of all training programmes and summer camps in affected areas such as Changaroth, Koorachund, Kottur, Cheruvannur, Chekyad, Chakkittapara and Olavanna.\n\nThe anganwadis [a center that provides basic health care in Indian villages] in these regions too have been asked to close down to avoid the spread of the virus among children.\n\nHowever, no decision has been taken yet concerning the reopening of schools after the summer vacation. The administration is hoping that the situation will be under control by the time schools reopen after a week. \"The number of newly infected cases is very low now\", Mr. Jose said in a statement.\n\nIn neighbouring Malappuram, where 3 persons have died due to the virus, orders have been issued in 4 panchayats [basic units of local administration] to stop Anganwadi classes for the time being.\n\nA crisis management group has been constituted to coordinate the response of government agencies following the deaths in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. The group comprises Additional Chief Secretaries of Health, Revenue, Labour, Home; Principal Secretary Forest, Director Animal Husbandry and state Epidemiologists, among others.\n\nKeeping in mind the sacrifice of the 28-year-old nurse at Perambra Taluk hospital, who died after being infected by the virus while treating her patients, the Government today decided to give a job to her husband and financial assistance of rs 10 lakh [USD 1465] each for her 2 sons -- aged 5 and 2. The next of kin of 9 others who died of the virus would be given an assistance of Rs. 5 lakh [USD 738] each.\n\nMeanwhile, DGP Loknath Behara warned that stern action would be taken against those who spread false information with regard to the virus in the social media. Creation of fake or false messages, spreading them to cause panic or public disorder are criminal acts and liable for investigation and prosecution. Directions have been issued to DGP (crimes) to register criminal cases against the creators of the messages and propagators, he said.\n\nAn expert team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), including its director, Dr. Sujeet Kumar Singh and Head of Epidemiology, Dr. S K Jain, and a high-level team from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) are already in Kerala to take stock of the situation.\n\nSurveillance has been increased in all districts.\n\nThe outbreak of the virus infection, which is a newly emerging zoonosis that causes severe disease in both animals and humans, is suspected to be from an unused well which was infested with bats.\n\nThe natural host of the virus is believed to be fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, _Pteropus_ genus.\n\nThe Kerala Health minister also said there was no need to be afraid of bats and their habitats should not to destroyed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley\n\n[A previous ProMED-mail post reported that bats roosing in a well may have been the source of Nipah virus infections in Kozhikode district's Changaroth village (see Nipah virus - India (03): (KL) conf. 20180522.5812214). A 22 May 2018 report in the Times of India indicated that team from National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal arrived in Kozhikode on that day. Following the Nipah virus outbreak that claimed 3 lives in Kozhikode and reports that fruit bats could be its natural host, people are becoming wary of bat colonies in their neighbourhood. Hundreds of Indian fruit bats, also known as the Indian flying fox bats, roosting on huge trees [not in wells] are not an uncommon sight. The bats are said to spread the virus through their droppings, saliva on half-eaten fruits. There are possibilities of human to human transmission.

However, fruit contaminated by fruit bats can be a source of human infection, as has occurred in children in Bangladesh who ate fallen fruit that the giant fruit bats had partially eaten. Public education is important to prevent consumption of contaminated fruit. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nNipah virus - India (03): (KL) conf. 20180522.5812214\nNipah virus - India (02): (KL) conf 20180521.5809003\nNipah virus - India: (KL) susp 20180521.5807513\n2007\n----\nNipah virus, fatal - India (West Bengal) (02) 20070511.1514\nNipah virus, fatal - India (West Bengal) 20070508.1484\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh, India (04) 20070504.1451\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh, India (03) 20070501.1413\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh, India (02) 20070430.1401\nUndiagnosed deaths - India (West Bengal): RFI 20070426.1365\nUndiagnosed deaths, encephalitis - Bangladesh (Kushtia) (02): Nipah, RFI\n20070423.1330\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh, India: RFI 20070420.1300\n2003\n----\nNipah-like virus - India (North Bengal): 2001 20030106.0050\n2001\n----\nUnexplained deaths - India (North Bengal) (11) 20010330.0643\nUnexplained deaths - India (North Bengal): RFI 20010220.0328\n.................................................sb/lm/ty/ao/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "nipah virus", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2018-05-24 00:00:00", "2018-05-24 00:00:00", "2018-05-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2001-03-16 00:00:00", "2001-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Mangaluru", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Anganwadi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chakkittapara", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kottur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bangladesh", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North Bengal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Koorachund", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kozhikode district", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bahrain", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Bengal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Karnataka", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UAE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United Arab Emirates", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kozhikode district 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kannur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mumbai", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5812214", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Nipah virus - India (03): (KL) conf.", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5812214", "date": "2011-02-04 23:50:00", "main_text": "NIPAH VIRUS, FATAL - BANGLADESH: (FARIDPUR)\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Mon 24 Jan 2011\nSource: Dhaka Mirror, New Age report [edited]\n<http://www.dhakamirror.com/?p=25180#more-25180>\n\n\nThe director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and\nResearch [IEDCR], Mahmudur Rahman, on Sunday [23 Jan 2011] said that 5\npeople were infected with the Nipah virus in Faridpur and Rajbari\ndistricts and 4 of them died this month [January 2011].

At the same time\ngovernment should set up a separate unit and introduce protective\nmeasures for treating Nipah virus victims in the hospitals, he said.\n\nIn 2004 a doctor and in 2010 an intern doctor, after being infected\nby the patients at the hospitals, were killed by Nipah virus\n[infection].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There were cases of Nipah virus infection in this same area a year\nago (January 2010; see ProMED-mail archive number 20100122.0250] . In\naddition to boiling palm juice, local villagers can construct bamboo\nskirts to deny fruit bat access to palm juice collection pots. It\nwould be of interest to know what measures have been taken to bring\ntransmission under control, other than the information provided to the\nvillagers.\n\nMod.CP provided a good summary of Nipah virus transmission and\nepidemiology in the ProMED-mail archive mentioned above. Unlike the\ninitial Nipah outbreak in Malaysia, human cases in Bangladesh do not\ninvolve pigs, transmission being from _Pteropus_ fruit bats to humans\nvia contaminated fruit or palm juice.\n\nAn image of a _Pteropus_ fruit bat can be found at\n<http://rpmedia.ask.com/ts?u=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Pteropus_giganteus_fg01.JPG/180px-Pteropus_giganteus_fg01.JPG>.\n\nThe location of Faridpur and Rajbari districts (Dhaka division) in\ncentral Bangladesh, can be seen on the map at\n<http://www.miraebd.net/demo/Bangladesh Maps.htm>.

Between 17 and 21 Jan 2004, 6\nadditional children (aged between 2 and 15 years) and a 28-year-old woman\n(mother of the youngest child) also died with the same symptoms. All\npatients came from the neighboring Kazipara and Juran Molla Para villages\nand lived in 2 groups of houses located within 1 km of each other. On 21\nJan 2004, Goalanda health authorities triggered the alert and sent a report\nto the central level. On 22 Jan 2004, a joint investigation mission with\nthe Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the\nMinistry of Health, the Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDRB),\nand the WHO country office was dispatched to Goalanda to verify the rumors\nand to collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.\nBetween 22 and 27 Jan 2004, the investigation team was able to confirm the\noutbreak and to provide a 1st description of the epidemic. Blood samples\nobtained from several patients were sent to the Special Pathogen Branch\n(SPB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,\nUSA. On 4 Feb 2004, SPB-CDC detected IgM antibodies against Nipah virus in\nthe serum of 5 patients. The laboratory investigations included ELISA tests\nfor IgG and IgM antibodies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nto detect the viral genome, and viral isolation. CDC was able to culture\nthe virus from 2 of the patients. Viral RNA was amplified to show that a\nNipah virus -- with about a 95 percent homology with that isolated during\nthe Malaysian outbreak in 1999 -- was the cause of the outbreak.\nSurveillance\n------------\nIn light of the findings of previous epidemic investigations and of the\nclinical presentation of the first 8 confirmed Bangladeshi cases, 3\ncategories were employed for case definition: (1) suspect, (2) probable,\nand (3) laboratory-confirmed. In addition, when samples were collected from\nprobable and suspect cases, they were reclassified as \"non-cases\" if they\nwere negative for Nipah virus IgM antibodies. Routine epidemiological\nsurveillance was reinforced by an active suspect-encephalitis\ncase-notification system -- implemented in Faridpur, Manikgonj, and Rajbari\ndistricts -- surrounding the outbreak epicenter. Surveillance was also\nreinforced by IEDCR across the entire territory.\nEpidemiology\n------------\nDescriptive epidemiology was undertaken based on the case definition. A\ncase of Nipah virus infection was any probable or laboratory-confirmed\ncase. As at 23 Feb 2004, 23 Nipah cases -- including 11\nlaboratory-confirmed cases -- had been identified in 6 districts (Faridpur,\nGolpagonj, Manikgonj, Joypurat, Naogaon, Rajbari). 17 of the 23 cases died\n(case-fatality rate of 74 percent). In all the affected districts, cases\nwere clustered geographically and in time. The 1st identified case\ndeveloped the 1st symptoms of the disease on 11 Jan 2004. Most of the\ndetected cases occurred between 12 and 25 Jan 2004 (for 20 out of 23 cases)\nsuggesting a common source of contamination. [Figure 1 (not shown here)\nillustrates the weekly distribution of cases (survivors and deaths) of\nNipah virus infection in 6 districts of Bangladesh as of 23 Feb 2004. -\nMod.CP.]\nThe main focus, with 12 Nipah cases, was identified in Goalanda, Rajbari\ndistrict, where an in-depth investigation was undertaken. Of the 12 cases,\n9 were male (75 percent) and aged under 19 years. The investigation failed\nto establish any link between these cases and sick pigs -- or other types\nof sick mammals -- as was observed during the Malaysian Nipah outbreak.\nConversely, it was noted in Goalanda that young boys collected and ate\nfruits in the trees before dawn. This observation gave rise to the\nhypothesis that contamination could have occurred while eating the same\nfruits that fruit bats (_Pteropodidae_) fed on during the night.\nSeveral epidemiological studies were conducted by the investigation team in\nGoalanda. These included a case-control study to identify risk factors for\ninfection, a seroprevalence study to assess the spread of the infection\n(antibody detection) in the general population, and a follow-up of\nconvalescent cases to assess antibody kinetics and duration of viral\nshedding. Fieldwork has been completed, and data analysis has begun.\nClinical description\n---------------------\nMost of the identified cases were transferred to the Dhaka Medical College\nHospital and the Dhaka Shishu Hospital where definitive case management was\norganized. Among 11 patients with laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever\n(11/11), headache (4/11), vomiting (5/11), dizziness (5/11), altered\nconsciousness or total or partial loss of consciousness (11/11), coma\n(9/11), focal neurological signs (3/11), disorientation/hallucination\n(4/11), seizure (8/11), respiratory distress (6/11) and cough/cold (3/11).\nEcological studies\n------------------\nEcological studies were conducted to establish the source of human\ninfection and identify the natural reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh.\nThe team focused its work in the Goalanda area and sampled domestic,\nperidomestic and wild animals living in or around the affected villages. It\nprioritized taxa associated with previous Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia\n(i.e. Megachiropteran bats and pigs). Laboratory investigations are\ncurrently under way at SPB-CDC, although preliminary results confirm that\nseveral _Pteropus_ flying foxes have evidence of Nipah virus infection.\nSocial mobilization and health education\n------------------\nThe Ministry of Health and the WHO team relayed all relevant information to\nthe press on a regular basis thereby keeping the public regularly informed\nabout the evolution of the situation and of investigations. Given the\nresults of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several\nhealth education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating\nfruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and\nhand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and\ntransmission of the disease. The support of medical anthropologists and\nexperts in social mobilization will be needed to prepare these messages.\nCluster of Nipah Cases in Faridpur District, Mar - Apr 2004\n-----------------\nOn 19 Apr 2004, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health reported one cluster of\n30 Nipah cases, including 18 deaths from 13 Mar to 14 Apr in Faridpur\ndistrict. Laboratory testing, performed by CDC, confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection in 16 of the cases.\nThe outbreak was investigated by a team comprising experts from the IEDCR,\nICDDRB and the WHO country office. All cases lived in Guha Laksmipur\nvillage or were in contact with a spiritual leader living in this village\nwho was himself a case. Direct contact with ill patients is suspected to\nhave played a role in the transmission of the disease and the spread of\nthis outbreak.\nThe team organized infection-control and safe clinical-management workshops\nfor local medical staff in different health care settings of the Faridpur\ndistrict. Investigations are continuing.\nConclusion\n----------\nAfter Meherpur (2001) and Naogaon (2003), Bangladesh faces again an\nepidemic of Nipah. As in 2001 and 2003, few cases were identified, but this\ntime suspect cases are more widely spread throughout the country. Until\nstudies have been completed, and control and prevention measures discussed,\nthe investigation team has proposed the following short-term recommendations:\n1. Creation of a task force for Nipah outbreaks using a multidisciplinary\napproach.\n2. Creation of special funds for outbreak response and to support families\nand hospitals.\n3. Institution of urgent measures to prevent nosocomial infection in all\nhospitals of the country (patient isolation, injection safety, safe waste\ndisposal, etc.).\n4. Preparation of prevention messages recommending hand-washing after\ntaking care of sick relatives and washing fruit, and peeling or cooking it,\nbefore eating.\nRecommendations also included medium-term activities such as strengthening\noutbreak detection and investigation capacity, strengthening basic\nlaboratory support, transferring Nipah laboratory diagnosis capacity to\nBangladesh, and conducting further studies on the ecology of _Pteropodidae_\nin Bangladesh.\nAn international workshop focusing on case-management, and a scientific\nmeeting on Nipah virus and Hendra virus, are planned to be held in Dhaka in\n2004 in collaboration with experts from Australia, Malaysia, Thailand and\nUnited States.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nSee Also\nNipah/Hendra-like virus - Bangladesh (2001/2003) 20040202.0398\nNipah/Hendra - like virus - Bangladesh (Rajbari) 20040206.0431\nNipah virus - Bangladesh (Faridpur) confirmed 20040420.1102\nUnexplained deaths - Bangladesh (Faridpur)(02): Nipah susp 20040419.1087\nUnexplained deaths - Bangladesh (Faridpur): RFI 20040407.0941\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh (Rajbari):RFI 20040125.0292\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh (Rajbari)(02): RFI 20040129.0336\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh (Rajbari) (03) 20040130.0346\nUndiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh (Rajbari)(04): Nip... 20040201.0387\n2002\n----\nNipah-like virus - Bangladesh (2001) 20020830.5187\n2001\n----\nUndiagnosed disease - Bangladesh: alert 20010524.1006\nUndiagnosed disease - Bangladesh: RFI 20010512.0919\nUnexplained deaths - India (North Bengal): RFI 20010220.0328\nUnexplained deaths - India (North Bengal) (11) 20010330.0643\n....................cp/msp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Between 17 and 21 Jan 2004, 6\nadditional children (aged between 2 and 15 years) and a 28-year-old woman\n(mother of the youngest child) also died with the same symptoms. All\npatients came from the neighboring Kazipara and Juran Molla Para villages\nand lived in 2 groups of houses located within 1 km of each other. On 21\nJan 2004, Goalanda health authorities triggered the alert and sent a report\nto the central level. On 22 Jan 2004, a joint investigation mission with\nthe Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the\nMinistry of Health, the Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDRB),\nand the WHO country office was dispatched to Goalanda to verify the rumors\nand to collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.\nBetween 22 and 27 Jan 2004, the investigation team was able to confirm the\noutbreak and to provide a 1st description of the epidemic. Blood samples\nobtained from several patients were sent to the Special Pathogen Branch\n(SPB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,\nUSA. On 4 Feb 2004, SPB-CDC detected IgM antibodies against Nipah virus in\nthe serum of 5 patients. The laboratory investigations included ELISA tests\nfor IgG and IgM antibodies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nto detect the viral genome, and viral isolation. CDC was able to culture\nthe virus from 2 of the patients. Viral RNA was amplified to show that a\nNipah virus -- with about a 95 percent homology with that isolated during\nthe Malaysian outbreak in 1999 -- was the cause of the outbreak.\nSurveillance\n------------\nIn light of the findings of previous epidemic investigations and of the\nclinical presentation of the first 8 confirmed Bangladeshi cases, 3\ncategories were employed for case definition: (1) suspect, (2) probable,\nand (3) laboratory-confirmed. In addition, when samples were collected from\nprobable and suspect cases, they were reclassified as \"non-cases\" if they\nwere negative for Nipah virus IgM antibodies. Routine epidemiological\nsurveillance was reinforced by an active suspect-encephalitis\ncase-notification system -- implemented in Faridpur, Manikgonj, and Rajbari\ndistricts -- surrounding the outbreak epicenter. Surveillance was also\nreinforced by IEDCR across the entire territory.\nEpidemiology\n------------\nDescriptive epidemiology was undertaken based on the case definition. A\ncase of Nipah virus infection was any probable or laboratory-confirmed\ncase. As at 23 Feb 2004, 23 Nipah cases -- including 11\nlaboratory-confirmed cases -- had been identified in 6 districts (Faridpur,\nGolpagonj, Manikgonj, Joypurat, Naogaon, Rajbari). 17 of the 23 cases died\n(case-fatality rate of 74 percent). In all the affected districts, cases\nwere clustered geographically and in time. The 1st identified case\ndeveloped the 1st symptoms of the disease on 11 Jan 2004. Most of the\ndetected cases occurred between 12 and 25 Jan 2004 (for 20 out of 23 cases)\nsuggesting a common source of contamination. [Figure 1 (not shown here)\nillustrates the weekly distribution of cases (survivors and deaths) of\nNipah virus infection in 6 districts of Bangladesh as of 23 Feb 2004. -\nMod.CP.]\nThe main focus, with 12 Nipah cases, was identified in Goalanda, Rajbari\ndistrict, where an in-depth investigation was undertaken. Of the 12 cases,\n9 were male (75 percent) and aged under 19 years. The investigation failed\nto establish any link between these cases and sick pigs -- or other types\nof sick mammals -- as was observed during the Malaysian Nipah outbreak.\nConversely, it was noted in Goalanda that young boys collected and ate\nfruits in the trees before dawn. This observation gave rise to the\nhypothesis that contamination could have occurred while eating the same\nfruits that fruit bats (_Pteropodidae_) fed on during the night.\nSeveral epidemiological studies were conducted by the investigation team in\nGoalanda. These included a case-control study to identify risk factors for\ninfection, a seroprevalence study to assess the spread of the infection\n(antibody detection) in the general population, and a follow-up of\nconvalescent cases to assess antibody kinetics and duration of viral\nshedding. Fieldwork has been completed, and data analysis has begun.\nClinical description\n---------------------\nMost of the identified cases were transferred to the Dhaka Medical College\nHospital and the Dhaka Shishu Hospital where definitive case management was\norganized. Among 11 patients with laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever\n(11/11), headache (4/11), vomiting (5/11), dizziness (5/11), altered\nconsciousness or total or partial loss of consciousness (11/11), coma\n(9/11), focal neurological signs (3/11), disorientation/hallucination\n(4/11), seizure (8/11), respiratory distress (6/11) and cough/cold (3/11).\nEcological studies\n------------------\nEcological studies were conducted to establish the source of human\ninfection and identify the natural reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh.\nThe team focused its work in the Goalanda area and sampled domestic,\nperidomestic and wild animals living in or around the affected villages. It\nprioritized taxa associated with previous Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia\n(i.e. Megachiropteran bats and pigs). Laboratory investigations are\ncurrently under way at SPB-CDC, although preliminary results confirm that\nseveral _Pteropus_ flying foxes have evidence of Nipah virus infection.\nSocial mobilization and health education\n------------------\nThe Ministry of Health and the WHO team relayed all relevant information to\nthe press on a regular basis thereby keeping the public regularly informed\nabout the evolution of the situation and of investigations. Given the\nresults of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several\nhealth education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating\nfruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and\nhand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and\ntransmission of the disease. The support of medical anthropologists and\nexperts in social mobilization will be needed to prepare these messages.\nCluster of Nipah Cases in Faridpur District, Mar - Apr 2004\n-----------------\nOn 19 Apr 2004, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health reported one cluster of\n30 Nipah cases, including 18 deaths from 13 Mar to 14 Apr in Faridpur\ndistrict. Laboratory testing, performed by CDC, confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection in 16 of the cases.\nThe outbreak was investigated by a team comprising experts from the IEDCR,\nICDDRB and the WHO country office. All cases lived in Guha Laksmipur\nvillage or were in contact with a spiritual leader living in this village\nwho was himself a case. Direct contact with ill patients is suspected to\nhave played a role in the transmission of the disease and the spread of\nthis outbreak.\nThe team organized infection-control and safe clinical-management workshops\nfor local medical staff in different health care settings of the Faridpur\ndistrict. Investigations are continuing.\nConclusion\n----------\nAfter Meherpur (2001) and Naogaon (2003), Bangladesh faces again an\nepidemic of Nipah.

Between 17 and 21 Jan 2004, 6\nadditional children (aged between 2 and 15 years) and a 28-year-old woman\n(mother of the youngest child) also died with the same symptoms. All\npatients came from the neighboring Kazipara and Juran Molla Para villages\nand lived in 2 groups of houses located within 1 km of each other. On 21\nJan 2004, Goalanda health authorities triggered the alert and sent a report\nto the central level. On 22 Jan 2004, a joint investigation mission with\nthe Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the\nMinistry of Health, the Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDRB),\nand the WHO country office was dispatched to Goalanda to verify the rumors\nand to collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.\nBetween 22 and 27 Jan 2004, the investigation team was able to confirm the\noutbreak and to provide a 1st description of the epidemic. Blood samples\nobtained from several patients were sent to the Special Pathogen Branch\n(SPB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,\nUSA. On 4 Feb 2004, SPB-CDC detected IgM antibodies against Nipah virus in\nthe serum of 5 patients. The laboratory investigations included ELISA tests\nfor IgG and IgM antibodies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nto detect the viral genome, and viral isolation. CDC was able to culture\nthe virus from 2 of the patients. Viral RNA was amplified to show that a\nNipah virus -- with about a 95 percent homology with that isolated during\nthe Malaysian outbreak in 1999 -- was the cause of the outbreak.\nSurveillance\n------------\nIn light of the findings of previous epidemic investigations and of the\nclinical presentation of the first 8 confirmed Bangladeshi cases, 3\ncategories were employed for case definition: (1) suspect, (2) probable,\nand (3) laboratory-confirmed. In addition, when samples were collected from\nprobable and suspect cases, they were reclassified as \"non-cases\" if they\nwere negative for Nipah virus IgM antibodies. Routine epidemiological\nsurveillance was reinforced by an active suspect-encephalitis\ncase-notification system -- implemented in Faridpur, Manikgonj, and Rajbari\ndistricts -- surrounding the outbreak epicenter. Surveillance was also\nreinforced by IEDCR across the entire territory.\nEpidemiology\n------------\nDescriptive epidemiology was undertaken based on the case definition. A\ncase of Nipah virus infection was any probable or laboratory-confirmed\ncase. As at 23 Feb 2004, 23 Nipah cases -- including 11\nlaboratory-confirmed cases -- had been identified in 6 districts (Faridpur,\nGolpagonj, Manikgonj, Joypurat, Naogaon, Rajbari). 17 of the 23 cases died\n(case-fatality rate of 74 percent). In all the affected districts, cases\nwere clustered geographically and in time. The 1st identified case\ndeveloped the 1st symptoms of the disease on 11 Jan 2004. Most of the\ndetected cases occurred between 12 and 25 Jan 2004 (for 20 out of 23 cases)\nsuggesting a common source of contamination. [Figure 1 (not shown here)\nillustrates the weekly distribution of cases (survivors and deaths) of\nNipah virus infection in 6 districts of Bangladesh as of 23 Feb 2004. -\nMod.CP.]\nThe main focus, with 12 Nipah cases, was identified in Goalanda, Rajbari\ndistrict, where an in-depth investigation was undertaken. Of the 12 cases,\n9 were male (75 percent) and aged under 19 years. The investigation failed\nto establish any link between these cases and sick pigs -- or other types\nof sick mammals -- as was observed during the Malaysian Nipah outbreak.\nConversely, it was noted in Goalanda that young boys collected and ate\nfruits in the trees before dawn. This observation gave rise to the\nhypothesis that contamination could have occurred while eating the same\nfruits that fruit bats (_Pteropodidae_) fed on during the night.\nSeveral epidemiological studies were conducted by the investigation team in\nGoalanda. These included a case-control study to identify risk factors for\ninfection, a seroprevalence study to assess the spread of the infection\n(antibody detection) in the general population, and a follow-up of\nconvalescent cases to assess antibody kinetics and duration of viral\nshedding. Fieldwork has been completed, and data analysis has begun.\nClinical description\n---------------------\nMost of the identified cases were transferred to the Dhaka Medical College\nHospital and the Dhaka Shishu Hospital where definitive case management was\norganized. Among 11 patients with laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever\n(11/11), headache (4/11), vomiting (5/11), dizziness (5/11), altered\nconsciousness or total or partial loss of consciousness (11/11), coma\n(9/11), focal neurological signs (3/11), disorientation/hallucination\n(4/11), seizure (8/11), respiratory distress (6/11) and cough/cold (3/11).\nEcological studies\n------------------\nEcological studies were conducted to establish the source of human\ninfection and identify the natural reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh.\nThe team focused its work in the Goalanda area and sampled domestic,\nperidomestic and wild animals living in or around the affected villages. It\nprioritized taxa associated with previous Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia\n(i.e. Megachiropteran bats and pigs). Laboratory investigations are\ncurrently under way at SPB-CDC, although preliminary results confirm that\nseveral _Pteropus_ flying foxes have evidence of Nipah virus infection.\nSocial mobilization and health education\n------------------\nThe Ministry of Health and the WHO team relayed all relevant information to\nthe press on a regular basis thereby keeping the public regularly informed\nabout the evolution of the situation and of investigations. Given the\nresults of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several\nhealth education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating\nfruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and\nhand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and\ntransmission of the disease. The support of medical anthropologists and\nexperts in social mobilization will be needed to prepare these messages.\nCluster of Nipah Cases in Faridpur District, Mar - Apr 2004\n-----------------\nOn 19 Apr 2004, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health reported one cluster of\n30 Nipah cases, including 18 deaths from 13 Mar to 14 Apr in Faridpur\ndistrict. Laboratory testing, performed by CDC, confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection in 16 of the cases.\nThe outbreak was investigated by a team comprising experts from the IEDCR,\nICDDRB and the WHO country office. All cases lived in Guha Laksmipur\nvillage or were in contact with a spiritual leader living in this village\nwho was himself a case. Direct contact with ill patients is suspected to\nhave played a role in the transmission of the disease and the spread of\nthis outbreak.\nThe team organized infection-control and safe clinical-management workshops\nfor local medical staff in different health care settings of the Faridpur\ndistrict. Investigations are continuing.\nConclusion\n----------\nAfter Meherpur (2001) and Naogaon (2003), Bangladesh faces again an\nepidemic of Nipah. As in 2001 and 2003, few cases were identified, but this\ntime suspect cases are more widely spread throughout the country. Until\nstudies have been completed, and control and prevention measures discussed,\nthe investigation team has proposed the following short-term recommendations:\n1. Creation of a task force for Nipah outbreaks using a multidisciplinary\napproach.\n2. Creation of special funds for outbreak response and to support families\nand hospitals.\n3.

Between 17 and 21 Jan 2004, 6\nadditional children (aged between 2 and 15 years) and a 28-year-old woman\n(mother of the youngest child) also died with the same symptoms. All\npatients came from the neighboring Kazipara and Juran Molla Para villages\nand lived in 2 groups of houses located within 1 km of each other. On 21\nJan 2004, Goalanda health authorities triggered the alert and sent a report\nto the central level. On 22 Jan 2004, a joint investigation mission with\nthe Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the\nMinistry of Health, the Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDRB),\nand the WHO country office was dispatched to Goalanda to verify the rumors\nand to collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.\nBetween 22 and 27 Jan 2004, the investigation team was able to confirm the\noutbreak and to provide a 1st description of the epidemic. Blood samples\nobtained from several patients were sent to the Special Pathogen Branch\n(SPB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,\nUSA. On 4 Feb 2004, SPB-CDC detected IgM antibodies against Nipah virus in\nthe serum of 5 patients. The laboratory investigations included ELISA tests\nfor IgG and IgM antibodies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nto detect the viral genome, and viral isolation. CDC was able to culture\nthe virus from 2 of the patients. Viral RNA was amplified to show that a\nNipah virus -- with about a 95 percent homology with that isolated during\nthe Malaysian outbreak in 1999 -- was the cause of the outbreak.\nSurveillance\n------------\nIn light of the findings of previous epidemic investigations and of the\nclinical presentation of the first 8 confirmed Bangladeshi cases, 3\ncategories were employed for case definition: (1) suspect, (2) probable,\nand (3) laboratory-confirmed. In addition, when samples were collected from\nprobable and suspect cases, they were reclassified as \"non-cases\" if they\nwere negative for Nipah virus IgM antibodies. Routine epidemiological\nsurveillance was reinforced by an active suspect-encephalitis\ncase-notification system -- implemented in Faridpur, Manikgonj, and Rajbari\ndistricts -- surrounding the outbreak epicenter. Surveillance was also\nreinforced by IEDCR across the entire territory.\nEpidemiology\n------------\nDescriptive epidemiology was undertaken based on the case definition. A\ncase of Nipah virus infection was any probable or laboratory-confirmed\ncase. As at 23 Feb 2004, 23 Nipah cases -- including 11\nlaboratory-confirmed cases -- had been identified in 6 districts (Faridpur,\nGolpagonj, Manikgonj, Joypurat, Naogaon, Rajbari). 17 of the 23 cases died\n(case-fatality rate of 74 percent). In all the affected districts, cases\nwere clustered geographically and in time. The 1st identified case\ndeveloped the 1st symptoms of the disease on 11 Jan 2004. Most of the\ndetected cases occurred between 12 and 25 Jan 2004 (for 20 out of 23 cases)\nsuggesting a common source of contamination. [Figure 1 (not shown here)\nillustrates the weekly distribution of cases (survivors and deaths) of\nNipah virus infection in 6 districts of Bangladesh as of 23 Feb 2004. -\nMod.CP.]\nThe main focus, with 12 Nipah cases, was identified in Goalanda, Rajbari\ndistrict, where an in-depth investigation was undertaken. Of the 12 cases,\n9 were male (75 percent) and aged under 19 years. The investigation failed\nto establish any link between these cases and sick pigs -- or other types\nof sick mammals -- as was observed during the Malaysian Nipah outbreak.\nConversely, it was noted in Goalanda that young boys collected and ate\nfruits in the trees before dawn. This observation gave rise to the\nhypothesis that contamination could have occurred while eating the same\nfruits that fruit bats (_Pteropodidae_) fed on during the night.\nSeveral epidemiological studies were conducted by the investigation team in\nGoalanda. These included a case-control study to identify risk factors for\ninfection, a seroprevalence study to assess the spread of the infection\n(antibody detection) in the general population, and a follow-up of\nconvalescent cases to assess antibody kinetics and duration of viral\nshedding. Fieldwork has been completed, and data analysis has begun.\nClinical description\n---------------------\nMost of the identified cases were transferred to the Dhaka Medical College\nHospital and the Dhaka Shishu Hospital where definitive case management was\norganized. Among 11 patients with laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever\n(11/11), headache (4/11), vomiting (5/11), dizziness (5/11), altered\nconsciousness or total or partial loss of consciousness (11/11), coma\n(9/11), focal neurological signs (3/11), disorientation/hallucination\n(4/11), seizure (8/11), respiratory distress (6/11) and cough/cold (3/11).\nEcological studies\n------------------\nEcological studies were conducted to establish the source of human\ninfection and identify the natural reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh.\nThe team focused its work in the Goalanda area and sampled domestic,\nperidomestic and wild animals living in or around the affected villages. It\nprioritized taxa associated with previous Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia\n(i.e. Megachiropteran bats and pigs). Laboratory investigations are\ncurrently under way at SPB-CDC, although preliminary results confirm that\nseveral _Pteropus_ flying foxes have evidence of Nipah virus infection.\nSocial mobilization and health education\n------------------\nThe Ministry of Health and the WHO team relayed all relevant information to\nthe press on a regular basis thereby keeping the public regularly informed\nabout the evolution of the situation and of investigations. Given the\nresults of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several\nhealth education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating\nfruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and\nhand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and\ntransmission of the disease. The support of medical anthropologists and\nexperts in social mobilization will be needed to prepare these messages.\nCluster of Nipah Cases in Faridpur District, Mar - Apr 2004\n-----------------\nOn 19 Apr 2004, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health reported one cluster of\n30 Nipah cases, including 18 deaths from 13 Mar to 14 Apr in Faridpur\ndistrict. Laboratory testing, performed by CDC, confirmed Nipah virus\ninfection in 16 of the cases.\nThe outbreak was investigated by a team comprising experts from the IEDCR,\nICDDRB and the WHO country office. All cases lived in Guha Laksmipur\nvillage or were in contact with a spiritual leader living in this village\nwho was himself a case. Direct contact with ill patients is suspected to\nhave played a role in the transmission of the disease and the spread of\nthis outbreak.\nThe team organized infection-control and safe clinical-management workshops\nfor local medical staff in different health care settings of the Faridpur\ndistrict. Investigations are continuing.\nConclusion\n----------\nAfter Meherpur (2001) and Naogaon (2003), Bangladesh faces again an\nepidemic of Nipah. As in 2001 and 2003, few cases were identified, but this\ntime suspect cases are more widely spread throughout the country. Until\nstudies have been completed, and control and prevention measures discussed,\nthe investigation team has proposed the following short-term recommendations:\n1. Creation of a task force for Nipah outbreaks using a multidisciplinary\napproach.\n2. Creation of special funds for outbreak response and to support families\nand hospitals.\n3.

The authorities\napparently [have adopted the following main criteria (among others) to\nrequire culling of affected farms: (1) Samples of pig serum testing\npositive to both ELISA (done in the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) and\nSNT tests (carried out in Australia); (2) Farm workers or owners living\nin/near farms detected with positive IgM titres.

Whether there is any problem in the\nprocessing or handling of the samples prior to despatch to Australia is\nsomething no one wants or is ready to answer.

Although\nacceptable for surveillance or monitoring, can ELISA tests (or serial\npositive ELISA tests) be used as the basis or culling? The VRI is carrying\nout PCR and immunoperoxidase tests on samples obtained from some of the\nfarms in Sarawak. Early indications are that viral antigens similar to\nNipah virus has been identified in samples obtained from Sibu farms. Up to\nthis moment no clinical signs has yet been seen in the pigs in farms where\nthe initial ELISA tests were positive and where workers/owners tested\npositive with IgM titres. Should the pigs in farms in this category be\nculled? Should we wait until we are sure that the \"viral agent\" does cause\nclinical disease in pigs and human? It is understandable that the\nauthorities should choose to err on the side of caution and in the overall\ninterest of human health. However,the impact of [such decisions, if the\npolicies of the Federal government are followed, are not only going to\ncause great financial hardship and emotional distress in the pig farming\ncommunity, but they may be a blow from which the pig industry here may\nnever recover.

Any of the above\nconditions would result in the order to cull with financial relief provided\nby the government in line with those provided in Peninsular Malaysia.\nFor the farming community, the situation has [become confused by the fact\nthat samples considered positive by ELISA test in Malaysia have been scored\nnegative by SNT in Australia. Whether there is any problem in the\nprocessing or handling of the samples prior to despatch to Australia is\nsomething no one wants or is ready to answer. How good are the ELISA tests\ndone by UNIMAS and VRI? Although these tests are undertaken [according to\nthe guidelines of CDC and CSIRO, have they been properly validated? How\nspecific and sensitive are the ELISA (IgM or IgG) tests used for screening?\nAre there any publised report or authorities that can be cited? Although\nacceptable for surveillance or monitoring, can ELISA tests (or serial\npositive ELISA tests) be used as the basis or culling? The VRI is carrying\nout PCR and immunoperoxidase tests on samples obtained from some of the\nfarms in Sarawak. Early indications are that viral antigens similar to\nNipah virus has been identified in samples obtained from Sibu farms. Up to\nthis moment no clinical signs has yet been seen in the pigs in farms where\nthe initial ELISA tests were positive and where workers/owners tested\npositive with IgM titres. Should the pigs in farms in this category be\nculled? Should we wait until we are sure that the \"viral agent\" does cause\nclinical disease in pigs and human? It is understandable that the\nauthorities should choose to err on the side of caution and in the overall\ninterest of human health. However,the impact of [such decisions, if the\npolicies of the Federal government are followed, are not only going to\ncause great financial hardship and emotional distress in the pig farming\ncommunity, but they may be a blow from which the pig industry here may\nnever recover.

Further studies at CDC, Atlanta, revealed\nthat the virus was related antigenically to the Australian Hendra virus.\nSince it is obviously a new virus, it was named Nipah virus after the\nlocality of the outbreak.\nAfter confirming that Nipah virus is a paramyxovirus, we advised the\nMinistry of Health on relevant control measures, which included the\navoidance of direct contact with infected pigs and the liberal use of\ndisinfectants in pig farms.
