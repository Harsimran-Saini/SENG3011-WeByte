According to this report, the Israeli, who recently arrived in China after travelling [in] India, contacted an Israeli businessman a few days ago and told him he was feeling ill, was suffering from severe back pain, had difficulty drinking and was vomiting constantly.\n\nThe businessman rushed the Israeli to a local hospital where he underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure. While at the hospital the Israeli suffered from hallucinations during which he claimed the Chinese doctors were trying to harvest his organs.\n\nThe physicians initially thought the man was suffering from some sort of mental illness and tried to determine whether he used drugs. Some doctors suggested transferring the Israeli to a psychiatric hospital after he recuperated, but his condition quickly deteriorated. He slipped in and out of consciousness, and the doctors hooked him up to a ventilator.\n\nThe mystery was solved when an infectious disease specialist was rushed to the Israeli's room and determined that he had contracted rabies. It remains unclear whether the Israeli, who died on Wed 19 Sep 2012, [had been] bitten by a dog and if so when [and where].\n\nMore than 55 000 people dies of rabies each year, [many] in India.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[People contract rabies predominantly following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal. Dogs are the main host and transmitter of rabies in Asia. The initial symptoms of rabies are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. As the virus spreads through the central nervous system, progressive, fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. 2 forms of the disease can follow. People with furious rabies exhibit signs of hyperactivity, excited behaviour, hydrophobia and sometimes aerophobia. After a few days, death occurs by cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies accounts for about 30 percent of the total number of human cases.\n\nNo tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease, and unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, the clinical diagnosis may be difficult. Human rabies can be confirmed intra-vitam and post mortem by various diagnostic techniques aimed at detecting whole virus, viral antigens or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin, urine or saliva).

The report lacks information on the date of arrival of the patient in Beijing or the length of his stay India [or elsewhere].

While at the hospital the Israeli suffered from hallucinations during which he claimed the Chinese doctors were trying to harvest his organs.\n\nThe physicians initially thought the man was suffering from some sort of mental illness and tried to determine whether he used drugs. Some doctors suggested transferring the Israeli to a psychiatric hospital after he recuperated, but his condition quickly deteriorated. He slipped in and out of consciousness, and the doctors hooked him up to a ventilator.\n\nThe mystery was solved when an infectious disease specialist was rushed to the Israeli's room and determined that he had contracted rabies. It remains unclear whether the Israeli, who died on Wed 19 Sep 2012, [had been] bitten by a dog and if so when [and where].\n\nMore than 55 000 people dies of rabies each year, [many] in India.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[People contract rabies predominantly following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal. Dogs are the main host and transmitter of rabies in Asia. The initial symptoms of rabies are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. As the virus spreads through the central nervous system, progressive, fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. 2 forms of the disease can follow. People with furious rabies exhibit signs of hyperactivity, excited behaviour, hydrophobia and sometimes aerophobia. After a few days, death occurs by cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies accounts for about 30 percent of the total number of human cases.\n\nNo tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease, and unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, the clinical diagnosis may be difficult.

Hence it cannot be determined whether he contracted infection prior to or after his arrival in Beijing. It is also possible that he may have been infected elsewhere (possibly even in Israel) prior to his arrival in India.

There have now been 10 cases reported in 2007,\nwhich is more than a quarter of the average yearly total.\n\"Here in SA, we get around 30 to 40 cases of all strains of _E. coli_\neach year,\" he said. \"These cases are usually quite sporadic and\noccur throughout the year. \"When we get a lot of cases occurring at\nonce and they seem to be linked in some way, then I guess we call\nthis an outbreak,\" Dr. Buckett said.\nHe said the fact that the infected people lived in different areas --\nincluding one in regional SA -- and were aged between 2 and 81 years\nof age, made identifying common links difficult.\nFlinders University gastroenterologist Professor Graeme Young said\nfinding the cause of the outbreak would involve a degree of\n\"detective work\". \"I think that if there isn't a common factor\nbetween the people, it makes it very hard to understand why this is\nhappening,\" Professor Young said.\n[Byline: Jessica Leo]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nSee Also\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia (SA)(02) 20070128.0366\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia (SA) 20070125.0328\nE. coli O157, lettuce - USA (multistate): 2006 20070112.0158\n2006\n----\nE. coli O157, fast food - USA (multistate) (05): lettuce 20061214.3516\nE. coli O157, fast food - USA (IA,MN): lettuce 20061214.3515\nE. coli O157, fast food - USA (multistate): green onions 20061206.3441\nE. coli O157 - USA (NJ, NY) 20061205.3425\nE. coli O157 - USA (NJ) 20061203.3415\nE. coli O157, spinach - USA (multistate)(20) 20061027.3067\nE. coli O157, spinach - USA (multistate): alert 20060915.2608\nE. coli O157, day care - USA (TN) 20060701.1823\nE. coli O157 - USA (multistate): unknown source 20060410.1068\nE. coli O157, unpasteurized milk - USA (OR,WA)(04) 20060121.0199\n2005\n----\nHemolytic uremic syndrome, petting zoo - USA (FL)(08) 20050408.1021\nE. coli O157, unpasteurized milk - USA (OR,WA) 20051216.3622\nE. coli O157 - USA (HI): alert 20050830.2564\nE. coli O157, lake swimming - USA (MN) 20050712.1983\nE. coli O157, ground beef - USA (multistate): recall 20050610.1612\nE. coli O157, religious camp - USA (OR)(02) 20050602.1540\nE. coli O157, religious camp - USA (OR) 20050531.1504\n1999\n----\nE. coli, hemolytic uremic syndrome - USA (Connecticut) 19990807.1368\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Argentina 19990405.0556\n1998\n----\nE. coli, hemolytic uremic syndrome - USA (Georgia)(04) 19980820.1667\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia (02) 19980430.0839\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia 19980429.0827\n1996\n----\nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome (2) 19960221.0334\nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome 19960220.0327\n................................ll/mj/lm\n\n--\nLarry Madoff, M.D.\nEditor, ProMED-mail\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There were 16 people doing volunteer\nwork at the monument, half of them digging in an Indian sweat cave off the\nmonument's main road and the other half working on the quarter-mile trail\nleading to the cave, called the \"Swelter Shelter.\"\nThe 8 volunteers, including one from inside the cave and 7 from the trail,\nwere taken to Ashley Valley Medical Center in Vernal. All but 2 were\nreleased Tuesday, according to Joseph B. Shaffer, director of the\nTri-County Health Department, which is investigating the mysterious\nillness. The 2 still in the hospital are being held for observation at\nleast through Wednesday.\nHealth officials ruled out bubonic plague, hantavirus [infection, and\ndeer-fly bites [which are known to transmit tularemia as possible causes.\nThe volunteers have been treated for fungal and bacterial infection,\nShaffer said. The fungal infection comes from the soil, with no possible\nperson-to-person transmission.\nAll 16 of the volunteers who became ill high school graduates and college\nstudents were from outside the area. They came from Alaska, Florida,\nKansas, Vermont, Virginia, and one from Poland. Volunteers from Utah and\nColorado were not affected. \"My suspicion is we develop a lot of immunities\nto things that knock people out who are not living here,\" Shaffer said.\nThe investigation team includes representatives from the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and local and state health officials. None\nof the young adults is in danger, said Shaffer, who praised the \"great\ncooperation\" between the hospital and public health officials in launching\nan immediate investigation.\n[Byline: Lois M.

Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis are\nillnesses that present with flu-like symptoms, and are infections with\ndimorphic fungi found in the soil in the USA, and could be responsible for\nthese outbreaks.\nHistoplasmosis is caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ . According to Gideon\n<http://www.gideononline.com>: histoplasmosis was first reported in the\nUnited States in 1926. The disease is endemic to the Ohio, Mississippi, and\nMissouri River valley areas, with highest rates in Kentucky, Illinois,\nIndiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee. Although the endemic area for\nblastomycosis overlaps that of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found\nfurther north, and not as far to the west as histoplasmosis. In 1969, it\nwas estimated that 40 million Americans were infected [with\nhistoplasmosis, with 200 000 cases of acute pulmonary disease per year.\nSkin test-positivity rates approach 95% in areas of South Kentucky and\nMiddle Tennessee; 80% to 90% in Kansas City (adults over age 20, 1963).\nCoccidioidomycosis is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_. According to\nGideon: Coccidioidomycosis was first reported in the United States in 1893:\nThe disease is most common in California (the San Joaquin Valley), Arizona,\nTexas, New Mexico, southern Nevada, and Utah. The highest incidence occurs\nin late summer and early fall -- large outbreaks frequently follow dust\nstorms. An estimated 100 000 infections occur in the United States\nannually, and 1 in 200 infections progresses to disseminated disease.\nBlastomycosis is caused by _Blastomyces dermatitidis_. Most cases are\nreported from Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, and Wisconsin. Infection was first reported in Colorado in 1998.\nAlthough the endemic area for blastomycosis overlaps that of\nhistoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found further north, and not as far\nto the west as histoplasmosis.\nBy geographic distribution, coccidioidomycosis would be the highest on the\nlist as possible etiologies followed by blastomycosis and then\nhistoplasmosis.

There were 16 people doing volunteer\nwork at the monument, half of them digging in an Indian sweat cave off the\nmonument's main road and the other half working on the quarter-mile trail\nleading to the cave, called the \"Swelter Shelter.\"\nThe 8 volunteers, including one from inside the cave and 7 from the trail,\nwere taken to Ashley Valley Medical Center in Vernal. All but 2 were\nreleased Tuesday, according to Joseph B. Shaffer, director of the\nTri-County Health Department, which is investigating the mysterious\nillness. The 2 still in the hospital are being held for observation at\nleast through Wednesday.\nHealth officials ruled out bubonic plague, hantavirus [infection, and\ndeer-fly bites [which are known to transmit tularemia as possible causes.\nThe volunteers have been treated for fungal and bacterial infection,\nShaffer said. The fungal infection comes from the soil, with no possible\nperson-to-person transmission.\nAll 16 of the volunteers who became ill high school graduates and college\nstudents were from outside the area. They came from Alaska, Florida,\nKansas, Vermont, Virginia, and one from Poland. Volunteers from Utah and\nColorado were not affected. \"My suspicion is we develop a lot of immunities\nto things that knock people out who are not living here,\" Shaffer said.\nThe investigation team includes representatives from the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and local and state health officials.

Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis are\nillnesses that present with flu-like symptoms, and are infections with\ndimorphic fungi found in the soil in the USA, and could be responsible for\nthese outbreaks.\nHistoplasmosis is caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ . According to Gideon\n<http://www.gideononline.com>: histoplasmosis was first reported in the\nUnited States in 1926. The disease is endemic to the Ohio, Mississippi, and\nMissouri River valley areas, with highest rates in Kentucky, Illinois,\nIndiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee. Although the endemic area for\nblastomycosis overlaps that of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found\nfurther north, and not as far to the west as histoplasmosis. In 1969, it\nwas estimated that 40 million Americans were infected [with\nhistoplasmosis, with 200 000 cases of acute pulmonary disease per year.\nSkin test-positivity rates approach 95% in areas of South Kentucky and\nMiddle Tennessee; 80% to 90% in Kansas City (adults over age 20, 1963).\nCoccidioidomycosis is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_. According to\nGideon: Coccidioidomycosis was first reported in the United States in 1893:\nThe disease is most common in California (the San Joaquin Valley), Arizona,\nTexas, New Mexico, southern Nevada, and Utah. The highest incidence occurs\nin late summer and early fall -- large outbreaks frequently follow dust\nstorms. An estimated 100 000 infections occur in the United States\nannually, and 1 in 200 infections progresses to disseminated disease.\nBlastomycosis is caused by _Blastomyces dermatitidis_. Most cases are\nreported from Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, and Wisconsin. Infection was first reported in Colorado in 1998.\nAlthough the endemic area for blastomycosis overlaps that of\nhistoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found further north, and not as far\nto the west as histoplasmosis.\nBy geographic distribution, coccidioidomycosis would be the highest on the\nlist as possible etiologies followed by blastomycosis and then\nhistoplasmosis.

All but 2 were\nreleased Tuesday, according to Joseph B. Shaffer, director of the\nTri-County Health Department, which is investigating the mysterious\nillness. The 2 still in the hospital are being held for observation at\nleast through Wednesday.\nHealth officials ruled out bubonic plague, hantavirus [infection, and\ndeer-fly bites [which are known to transmit tularemia as possible causes.\nThe volunteers have been treated for fungal and bacterial infection,\nShaffer said. The fungal infection comes from the soil, with no possible\nperson-to-person transmission.\nAll 16 of the volunteers who became ill high school graduates and college\nstudents were from outside the area. They came from Alaska, Florida,\nKansas, Vermont, Virginia, and one from Poland. Volunteers from Utah and\nColorado were not affected. \"My suspicion is we develop a lot of immunities\nto things that knock people out who are not living here,\" Shaffer said.\nThe investigation team includes representatives from the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and local and state health officials.

Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis are\nillnesses that present with flu-like symptoms, and are infections with\ndimorphic fungi found in the soil in the USA, and could be responsible for\nthese outbreaks.\nHistoplasmosis is caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ . According to Gideon\n<http://www.gideononline.com>: histoplasmosis was first reported in the\nUnited States in 1926. The disease is endemic to the Ohio, Mississippi, and\nMissouri River valley areas, with highest rates in Kentucky, Illinois,\nIndiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee. Although the endemic area for\nblastomycosis overlaps that of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found\nfurther north, and not as far to the west as histoplasmosis. In 1969, it\nwas estimated that 40 million Americans were infected [with\nhistoplasmosis, with 200 000 cases of acute pulmonary disease per year.\nSkin test-positivity rates approach 95% in areas of South Kentucky and\nMiddle Tennessee; 80% to 90% in Kansas City (adults over age 20, 1963).\nCoccidioidomycosis is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_. According to\nGideon: Coccidioidomycosis was first reported in the United States in 1893:\nThe disease is most common in California (the San Joaquin Valley), Arizona,\nTexas, New Mexico, southern Nevada, and Utah. The highest incidence occurs\nin late summer and early fall -- large outbreaks frequently follow dust\nstorms. An estimated 100 000 infections occur in the United States\nannually, and 1 in 200 infections progresses to disseminated disease.\nBlastomycosis is caused by _Blastomyces dermatitidis_. Most cases are\nreported from Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, and Wisconsin. Infection was first reported in Colorado in 1998.\nAlthough the endemic area for blastomycosis overlaps that of\nhistoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found further north, and not as far\nto the west as histoplasmosis.\nBy geographic distribution, coccidioidomycosis would be the highest on the\nlist as possible etiologies followed by blastomycosis and then\nhistoplasmosis.

Key test results are expected by week's end.\n- Hamilton County: 8 confirmed cases including 2 in Loveland, 2 in Indian\nHill, 2 in Anderson township, one each in Blue Ash and Symmes Township.\n- Butler county: 6 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases; includes 4 in\nFairfield, 2 in Liberty Township, one each in Union and Madison townships.\n- Clermont County: 6 confirmed cases, mostly in Union and Miami Townships\nnear the Hamilton County line.\nThe Ohio Department of Health and county departments of health [have\nindicated that:\nno deaths have occurred in the local cluster, but several victims were sick\nenough to require hospital care.\nAlthough the investigation is in its early stages, officials do not think\nall 20 people got sick from a single source of contamination, such as a\ngroup picnic or restaurant.\n\"It is really very unlikely that it's a single source,\" said Janet\nRickabaugh, Clermont County health commissioner. \"[The investigation could\ntake several weeks. And we may never find out much more information on the\nsource.\"\nTracking the source of a foodborne illness can be complicated, health\nofficials say. People don't always accurately remember what they eat and\nfinding samples of contaminated food can be elusive.\nThe 20 cases include eight in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and\nsix in Butler County. All were diagnosed in June or July.\nThat's an unusually high number, even though health officials say summer is\nthe peak season for _E. coli_ infections. Those three counties reported a\ntotal of 11 cases in 1998, [according to Ohio Department of Health\nspokeswoman Jane Beathard.\nStatewide, 87 cases of _E. coli_ illnesses were reported this year through\nJuly 28, compared with 54 cases in the same period a year ago.\n_E. coli_ O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of _E. coli_ bacteria, many\nof which pose no threat to human health. The dangerous strain is commonly\npassed by eating undercooked beef. However, _E. coli_ outbreaks also have\nbeen linked to unpasteurized milk and apple juice, and raw alfalfa sprouts.\nThe [infection can be spread by failing to wash hands after using the\nrestroom or changing diapers, or by drinking or swimming in contaminated\nwater.\nTo find the source or sources of the local cluster, county health\ndepartments have been interviewing victims about what they ate and where.\nBacterial samples collected from the victims have been sent to the state\nhealth department for closer analysis.\nThree experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, brought\nin at the request of the state health department, arrived Wednesday. They\nwill be working from the Clermont County Health Department.\nBased on interviews with the people who became sick, food samples have been\ncollected from at least two restaurants, but no test results were available\nWednesday.\nThe state health department expects to have results by week's end from a\ntype of bacteria DNA testing called pulsed field gel electrophoresis.\nEven _E. coli_ O157:H7 can vary in subtle ways. The DNA test can tell much\nlike a fingerprint whether any of the 20 people caught the same variation\nof the strain.\nThe lack of common circumstances among the cases makes it likely that more\nthan one source of contamination was involved.\nIn Clermont County, none of the six victims were from the same family. In\nButler County, ages of victims ranged from 4 to 82. In Hamilton County,\nvictims lived in five different cities or townships, with ages ranging from\n4 to 63.\n\"We've been trying to find a common food source, but so far we haven't\nfound one,\" said Patricia Burg, director of the Butler County Health\nDepartment.\nNo new cases have been reported for several days, but it is too soon to\ntell whether the cluster is likely to grow beyond the 20 cases, Ms.\nBeathard said. The potential risk to the public depends on the cause or\ncauses of the illness.\nFranklin County has reported four recent _E. coli_ cases near Columbus but\nstate officials do not believe those cases are linked to the Greater\nCincinnati cases. Officials also are investigating three cases reported in\nKentucky and one in Indiana to see if they might be linked to the local\ncluster.\n[Byline: Tim Bonfield\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[This article suggests this outbreak may be bigger than just the southern\nportion of Ohio.

Key test results are expected by week's end.\n- Hamilton County: 8 confirmed cases including 2 in Loveland, 2 in Indian\nHill, 2 in Anderson township, one each in Blue Ash and Symmes Township.\n- Butler county: 6 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases; includes 4 in\nFairfield, 2 in Liberty Township, one each in Union and Madison townships.\n- Clermont County: 6 confirmed cases, mostly in Union and Miami Townships\nnear the Hamilton County line.\nThe Ohio Department of Health and county departments of health [have\nindicated that:\nno deaths have occurred in the local cluster, but several victims were sick\nenough to require hospital care.\nAlthough the investigation is in its early stages, officials do not think\nall 20 people got sick from a single source of contamination, such as a\ngroup picnic or restaurant.\n\"It is really very unlikely that it's a single source,\" said Janet\nRickabaugh, Clermont County health commissioner. \"[The investigation could\ntake several weeks. And we may never find out much more information on the\nsource.\"\nTracking the source of a foodborne illness can be complicated, health\nofficials say. People don't always accurately remember what they eat and\nfinding samples of contaminated food can be elusive.\nThe 20 cases include eight in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and\nsix in Butler County. All were diagnosed in June or July.\nThat's an unusually high number, even though health officials say summer is\nthe peak season for _E. coli_ infections. Those three counties reported a\ntotal of 11 cases in 1998, [according to Ohio Department of Health\nspokeswoman Jane Beathard.\nStatewide, 87 cases of _E. coli_ illnesses were reported this year through\nJuly 28, compared with 54 cases in the same period a year ago.\n_E. coli_ O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of _E. coli_ bacteria, many\nof which pose no threat to human health. The dangerous strain is commonly\npassed by eating undercooked beef. However, _E. coli_ outbreaks also have\nbeen linked to unpasteurized milk and apple juice, and raw alfalfa sprouts.\nThe [infection can be spread by failing to wash hands after using the\nrestroom or changing diapers, or by drinking or swimming in contaminated\nwater.\nTo find the source or sources of the local cluster, county health\ndepartments have been interviewing victims about what they ate and where.\nBacterial samples collected from the victims have been sent to the state\nhealth department for closer analysis.\nThree experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, brought\nin at the request of the state health department, arrived Wednesday. They\nwill be working from the Clermont County Health Department.\nBased on interviews with the people who became sick, food samples have been\ncollected from at least two restaurants, but no test results were available\nWednesday.\nThe state health department expects to have results by week's end from a\ntype of bacteria DNA testing called pulsed field gel electrophoresis.\nEven _E. coli_ O157:H7 can vary in subtle ways. The DNA test can tell much\nlike a fingerprint whether any of the 20 people caught the same variation\nof the strain.\nThe lack of common circumstances among the cases makes it likely that more\nthan one source of contamination was involved.\nIn Clermont County, none of the six victims were from the same family. In\nButler County, ages of victims ranged from 4 to 82. In Hamilton County,\nvictims lived in five different cities or townships, with ages ranging from\n4 to 63.\n\"We've been trying to find a common food source, but so far we haven't\nfound one,\" said Patricia Burg, director of the Butler County Health\nDepartment.\nNo new cases have been reported for several days, but it is too soon to\ntell whether the cluster is likely to grow beyond the 20 cases, Ms.\nBeathard said. The potential risk to the public depends on the cause or\ncauses of the illness.\nFranklin County has reported four recent _E. coli_ cases near Columbus but\nstate officials do not believe those cases are linked to the Greater\nCincinnati cases.

Key test results are expected by week's end.\n- Hamilton County: 8 confirmed cases including 2 in Loveland, 2 in Indian\nHill, 2 in Anderson township, one each in Blue Ash and Symmes Township.\n- Butler county: 6 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases; includes 4 in\nFairfield, 2 in Liberty Township, one each in Union and Madison townships.\n- Clermont County: 6 confirmed cases, mostly in Union and Miami Townships\nnear the Hamilton County line.\nThe Ohio Department of Health and county departments of health [have\nindicated that:\nno deaths have occurred in the local cluster, but several victims were sick\nenough to require hospital care.\nAlthough the investigation is in its early stages, officials do not think\nall 20 people got sick from a single source of contamination, such as a\ngroup picnic or restaurant.\n\"It is really very unlikely that it's a single source,\" said Janet\nRickabaugh, Clermont County health commissioner. \"[The investigation could\ntake several weeks. And we may never find out much more information on the\nsource.\"\nTracking the source of a foodborne illness can be complicated, health\nofficials say. People don't always accurately remember what they eat and\nfinding samples of contaminated food can be elusive.\nThe 20 cases include eight in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and\nsix in Butler County. All were diagnosed in June or July.\nThat's an unusually high number, even though health officials say summer is\nthe peak season for _E. coli_ infections. Those three counties reported a\ntotal of 11 cases in 1998, [according to Ohio Department of Health\nspokeswoman Jane Beathard.\nStatewide, 87 cases of _E. coli_ illnesses were reported this year through\nJuly 28, compared with 54 cases in the same period a year ago.\n_E. coli_ O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of _E. coli_ bacteria, many\nof which pose no threat to human health. The dangerous strain is commonly\npassed by eating undercooked beef. However, _E. coli_ outbreaks also have\nbeen linked to unpasteurized milk and apple juice, and raw alfalfa sprouts.\nThe [infection can be spread by failing to wash hands after using the\nrestroom or changing diapers, or by drinking or swimming in contaminated\nwater.\nTo find the source or sources of the local cluster, county health\ndepartments have been interviewing victims about what they ate and where.\nBacterial samples collected from the victims have been sent to the state\nhealth department for closer analysis.\nThree experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, brought\nin at the request of the state health department, arrived Wednesday. They\nwill be working from the Clermont County Health Department.\nBased on interviews with the people who became sick, food samples have been\ncollected from at least two restaurants, but no test results were available\nWednesday.\nThe state health department expects to have results by week's end from a\ntype of bacteria DNA testing called pulsed field gel electrophoresis.\nEven _E. coli_ O157:H7 can vary in subtle ways. The DNA test can tell much\nlike a fingerprint whether any of the 20 people caught the same variation\nof the strain.\nThe lack of common circumstances among the cases makes it likely that more\nthan one source of contamination was involved.\nIn Clermont County, none of the six victims were from the same family. In\nButler County, ages of victims ranged from 4 to 82. In Hamilton County,\nvictims lived in five different cities or townships, with ages ranging from\n4 to 63.\n\"We've been trying to find a common food source, but so far we haven't\nfound one,\" said Patricia Burg, director of the Butler County Health\nDepartment.\nNo new cases have been reported for several days, but it is too soon to\ntell whether the cluster is likely to grow beyond the 20 cases, Ms.\nBeathard said. The potential risk to the public depends on the cause or\ncauses of the illness.\nFranklin County has reported four recent _E. coli_ cases near Columbus but\nstate officials do not believe those cases are linked to the Greater\nCincinnati cases. Officials also are investigating three cases reported in\nKentucky and one in Indiana to see if they might be linked to the local\ncluster.\n[Byline: Tim Bonfield\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[This article suggests this outbreak may be bigger than just the southern\nportion of Ohio. There is a greater than 50% increase in reported cases as\nof 28 July this year from the same period in 1998 (87 vs 54 cases) of\nwhich only 61% are attributed to this cluster (20 of 33). In addition,\nthere is mention that 3 cases in Kentucky and one in Indiana are under\ninvestigation as possibly related to this cluster. One obvious question is\nwhether this is related to a commercial product distributed in the region\nvs. a common source event which this article seems to rule out. - MPP\n...........................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

[The investigators] were told that the most affected areas were\nUrapmin and Ibikmen but that people had fled their usual dwellings due to\nfear of sorcery and were living in bush houses. They were strongly advised\nnot to go to these areas on foot by the people at Yapsie, because of the\ndangers of sorcery. The team were willing to go into Urapmin by chopper so\nwe flew them [there], accompanied by a local guide. The main village of\nUrapmin appeared deserted so we proceeded up the Aki river to an isolated\nhamlet and managed to land the chopper on a tiny beach in a nearby creek.\nThere seemed to be about 20-30 people living here, many covered in \"grille\"\nand with swollen bellies but seemed to be saying they were all OK, as far as\nI could make out above the noise of the chopper. The terrain here is very\nbroken and mountainous and I believe these people must be in a chronic state\nof poor health, with no ready access to any form of health care. There did\nnot appear to have been any deaths there but we left a team behind to\ninvestigate further.\nThe other team (from the Health Dept. in Vanimo) had gone to Ibikmin\nvillage. When we arrived they had already left; apparently there were no\nproblems there either.\nWe proceeded to another isolated hamlet on a heavily forested ridge, known\nas Finyaksolmin. The second team had only just arrived the night before and\nhad had no chance to check the local population yet. They were told there\nhad been no deaths here but 2 people had died at nearby Firayabamin, one\nolder woman of COAD [?] and a young man of malaria (?).\nBack at Yapsie [the health worker] who had been left in charge for the last\nfew months reported that health-wise things [were bad but] hadn't really got\nany worse during the drought, with a high prevalence of childhood\nmalnutrition (30-50%) and many patients with chronic anaemia and\nhepatosplenomegaly (secondary to filariasis and malaria). There is a high\nproportion of refugees now residing amongst the locals at Yapsie who have\n[come] from over the border with Irian Jaya (just 10 kms away). The\npresence of the refugees in an already marginally productive environment\nexacerbates the malnutrition problem, and malnutrition is accepted as the\nnorm for growing children. No doubt the maternal, infant and childhood\nmortality rates must be amongst the highest in PNG, even under normal\nclimatological conditions. Even in October Yapsie appeared fairly green and\nnot much affected by drought. Now the Sepik river is in flood and there is\nlittle evidence of drought except for the extensive bushfires in the high\ncountry between here and Tabubil.\nA review of the Health Centre monthly reports at Yapsie indicates there was\nnot much change in outpatient illness rates for the common conditions of\ncough, pneumonia, other respiratory disease, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia,\nyaws and other skin diseases during October-November (total of 1200\nattendances each month). During the first 3 weeks of December there appears\nto have been an increase in malaria, 'flu, diarrhoea and skin diseases (the\nlatter esp. from Munbil, ?some ulcers requiring skin grafts). However there\nhas been no increase in deaths recorded at Yapsie and the [administrator]\nfrom Fiak was also surprised to hear of the 10 deaths which were reported\nfrom his area, none of which he was aware of.\nIt would appear that the lay reporting of 19 deaths and 24-30 people\ncritically ill or comatose in the Yapsie and Fiak subdistricts of Telefomin\nhas been grossly exaggerated. The reporting of these deaths may have come\nabout due to the rumours of sorcery and the confusion arising from the\nabandonment of villages in the area.

However there did not\nappear to be any excess of morbidity or mortality at this time, nor during\nthe drought. [The investigators] were told that the most affected areas were\nUrapmin and Ibikmen but that people had fled their usual dwellings due to\nfear of sorcery and were living in bush houses. They were strongly advised\nnot to go to these areas on foot by the people at Yapsie, because of the\ndangers of sorcery. The team were willing to go into Urapmin by chopper so\nwe flew them [there], accompanied by a local guide. The main village of\nUrapmin appeared deserted so we proceeded up the Aki river to an isolated\nhamlet and managed to land the chopper on a tiny beach in a nearby creek.\nThere seemed to be about 20-30 people living here, many covered in \"grille\"\nand with swollen bellies but seemed to be saying they were all OK, as far as\nI could make out above the noise of the chopper. The terrain here is very\nbroken and mountainous and I believe these people must be in a chronic state\nof poor health, with no ready access to any form of health care. There did\nnot appear to have been any deaths there but we left a team behind to\ninvestigate further.\nThe other team (from the Health Dept. in Vanimo) had gone to Ibikmin\nvillage. When we arrived they had already left; apparently there were no\nproblems there either.\nWe proceeded to another isolated hamlet on a heavily forested ridge, known\nas Finyaksolmin. The second team had only just arrived the night before and\nhad had no chance to check the local population yet. They were told there\nhad been no deaths here but 2 people had died at nearby Firayabamin, one\nolder woman of COAD [?] and a young man of malaria (?).\nBack at Yapsie [the health worker] who had been left in charge for the last\nfew months reported that health-wise things [were bad but] hadn't really got\nany worse during the drought, with a high prevalence of childhood\nmalnutrition (30-50%) and many patients with chronic anaemia and\nhepatosplenomegaly (secondary to filariasis and malaria). There is a high\nproportion of refugees now residing amongst the locals at Yapsie who have\n[come] from over the border with Irian Jaya (just 10 kms away). The\npresence of the refugees in an already marginally productive environment\nexacerbates the malnutrition problem, and malnutrition is accepted as the\nnorm for growing children. No doubt the maternal, infant and childhood\nmortality rates must be amongst the highest in PNG, even under normal\nclimatological conditions. Even in October Yapsie appeared fairly green and\nnot much affected by drought. Now the Sepik river is in flood and there is\nlittle evidence of drought except for the extensive bushfires in the high\ncountry between here and Tabubil.\nA review of the Health Centre monthly reports at Yapsie indicates there was\nnot much change in outpatient illness rates for the common conditions of\ncough, pneumonia, other respiratory disease, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia,\nyaws and other skin diseases during October-November (total of 1200\nattendances each month). During the first 3 weeks of December there appears\nto have been an increase in malaria, 'flu, diarrhoea and skin diseases (the\nlatter esp. from Munbil, ?some ulcers requiring skin grafts). However there\nhas been no increase in deaths recorded at Yapsie and the [administrator]\nfrom Fiak was also surprised to hear of the 10 deaths which were reported\nfrom his area, none of which he was aware of.\nIt would appear that the lay reporting of 19 deaths and 24-30 people\ncritically ill or comatose in the Yapsie and Fiak subdistricts of Telefomin\nhas been grossly exaggerated. The reporting of these deaths may have come\nabout due to the rumours of sorcery and the confusion arising from the\nabandonment of villages in the area.

However there did not\nappear to be any excess of morbidity or mortality at this time, nor during\nthe drought. [The investigators] were told that the most affected areas were\nUrapmin and Ibikmen but that people had fled their usual dwellings due to\nfear of sorcery and were living in bush houses. They were strongly advised\nnot to go to these areas on foot by the people at Yapsie, because of the\ndangers of sorcery. The team were willing to go into Urapmin by chopper so\nwe flew them [there], accompanied by a local guide. The main village of\nUrapmin appeared deserted so we proceeded up the Aki river to an isolated\nhamlet and managed to land the chopper on a tiny beach in a nearby creek.\nThere seemed to be about 20-30 people living here, many covered in \"grille\"\nand with swollen bellies but seemed to be saying they were all OK, as far as\nI could make out above the noise of the chopper. The terrain here is very\nbroken and mountainous and I believe these people must be in a chronic state\nof poor health, with no ready access to any form of health care. There did\nnot appear to have been any deaths there but we left a team behind to\ninvestigate further.\nThe other team (from the Health Dept. in Vanimo) had gone to Ibikmin\nvillage.

The second team had only just arrived the night before and\nhad had no chance to check the local population yet. They were told there\nhad been no deaths here but 2 people had died at nearby Firayabamin, one\nolder woman of COAD [?] and a young man of malaria (?).\nBack at Yapsie [the health worker] who had been left in charge for the last\nfew months reported that health-wise things [were bad but] hadn't really got\nany worse during the drought, with a high prevalence of childhood\nmalnutrition (30-50%) and many patients with chronic anaemia and\nhepatosplenomegaly (secondary to filariasis and malaria). There is a high\nproportion of refugees now residing amongst the locals at Yapsie who have\n[come] from over the border with Irian Jaya (just 10 kms away). The\npresence of the refugees in an already marginally productive environment\nexacerbates the malnutrition problem, and malnutrition is accepted as the\nnorm for growing children. No doubt the maternal, infant and childhood\nmortality rates must be amongst the highest in PNG, even under normal\nclimatological conditions. Even in October Yapsie appeared fairly green and\nnot much affected by drought. Now the Sepik river is in flood and there is\nlittle evidence of drought except for the extensive bushfires in the high\ncountry between here and Tabubil.\nA review of the Health Centre monthly reports at Yapsie indicates there was\nnot much change in outpatient illness rates for the common conditions of\ncough, pneumonia, other respiratory disease, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia,\nyaws and other skin diseases during October-November (total of 1200\nattendances each month). During the first 3 weeks of December there appears\nto have been an increase in malaria, 'flu, diarrhoea and skin diseases (the\nlatter esp. from Munbil, ?some ulcers requiring skin grafts).

Such animals appear to be more heavily infested by I.\nricinus ticks, than are roe deer, taken nearby.\nMy own studies take me to a sub-alpine site in eastern Switzerland where\nTBE transmission is frequent, and where chamois appear to be the main local\nhost for adult I. ricinus, rather than roe deer. Chamois avoid human\ncontact more than do roe deer. Chamois-dependent tick populations\ntherefore may tend not to come in contact with people, which could explain\nwhy people acquire TBE infection so sporadically in such areas.\nAlthough chamois have never been implicated as reservoir hosts for TBE\nvirus, and the involvement of ibex suggests an altitude not suitable for\nticks, the reference to a neurological disease of ungulates \"in a remote\narea\" might suggest this agent.\n[Thanks very much for the response.
