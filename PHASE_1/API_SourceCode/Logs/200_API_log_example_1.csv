He made the statement during an online conversation about the pandemic with Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, but Newsom offered little additional information about the circumstances of the diagnosis.\\n\\nThe 1st case of the coronavirus variant in the US was detected in Colorado on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020]. Experts have said it spreads faster than the common strain. Fauci said he wasn't surprised by reports of the latest case and suggested there are likely others in California and other states due to international travel. 'I don't think that Californians should feel that this is something odd. This is something that's expected,' Fauci said. He added there is 'no indication that it increases the virulence' of the infection any more than the variant that has been present in the US since February [2020]. Nor is there any evidence it can evade 'the protection that's afforded by the antibodies that are induced by vaccines.'\\n\\n[byline: Vanessa Romo]\\n\\n--\\ncommunicated by:\\nClaudine Miller\\nTulane Outbreak Daily\\n<cmiller15@tuland.edu>\\n\\n----\\n[A2] Florida, California\\nDate: Fri 1 Jan 2021 4:50 AM CET\\nSource: NBC [abridged, edited]\\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-variant-found-florida-more-cases-identified-california-n1252637\\n\\n\\nFlorida health officials said on Thursday [31 Dec 2020] they have evidence that the COVID-19 variant first detected in the UK has been found in a patient there, making it the 3rd state to report the strain.\\n\\nAs the variant crops up in new states, officials in San Diego County, California, said the strain, which is sometimes known as B.1.1.7., has been identified in 3 more people in San Diego County, bringing the number of confirmed cases there to 4.\\n\\n[byline: Phil Helsel]\\n\\n--\\ncommunicated by:\\nProMED\\n<promed@promedmail.org>\\n\\n----\\n[B] China ex UK\\nDate: Thu 31 Dec 2020 2:38 PM GMT+1\\nSource: Yahoo News, Reuters report [abridged, edited]\\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/china-reports-first-case-coronavirus-133852730.html\\n\\n\\nChina has detected its 1st imported case of the new coronavirus variant that is spreading rapidly around Britain, according to a publication run by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The vaccine produced strikingly high levels of antibodies in early clinical trials. In September [2020], the vaccine entered a Phase 3 clinical trial in the United Kingdom and another one in the United States at the end of December [2020]. Those trials will show whether the vaccine is safe and effective.\\n\\nCoronavirus proteins: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is studded with proteins that it uses to enter human cells. These so-called spike proteins make a tempting target for potential vaccines and treatments. The Novavax vaccine works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies to the spike protein.\\n\\nGrowing spike proteins: To create their vaccine, Novavax researchers started with a modified spike gene. They inserted the gene into a different virus, called a baculovirus, and allowed it to infect insect cells. The infected cells produced spike proteins that spontaneously joined together to form spikes, as they do on the surface of the coronavirus.\\n\\nA similar method of growing and harvesting virus proteins is already used to make licensed vaccines for diseases including influenza and HPV.\\n\\nBuilding nanoparticles: The researchers harvested the spike proteins from the insect cells and assembled them into nanoparticles. While the nanoparticles mimicked the molecular structure of the coronavirus, they could not replicate or cause COVID-19.\\n\\nPresenting the spike: The vaccine is injected into the muscles of the arm. Each injection includes many spike nanoparticles, along with a compound extracted from the soapbark tree. The compound attracts immune cells to the site of the injection and causes them to respond more strongly to the nanoparticles.\\n\\nSpotting the intruder: Immune cells called antigen-presenting cells encounter the vaccine nanoparticles and take them up. An antigen-presenting cell tears apart the spike proteins and displays some of their fragments on its surface. A so-called helper T cell may detect the fragments. If a fragment fits into one of its surface proteins, the T cell becomes activated. Now it can recruit other immune cells to respond to the vaccine.\\n\\nMaking antibodies: Another type of immune cell, called a B cell, may also encounter the vaccine nanoparticles. B cells have surface proteins in a huge variety of shapes, and a few might have the right shape to latch onto a spike protein. If a B cell does latch on, it can pull the vaccine particle inside and present spike protein fragments on its surface.\\n\\nIf a helper T cell activated against the spike protein latches onto one of these fragments, it activates the B cell. Now the B cell proliferates and pours out antibodies that have the same shape as its surface proteins.\\n\\nStopping the coronavirus: If vaccinated people are later exposed to the coronavirus, their antibodies can lock onto the spike proteins. The coronavirus cannot enter cells, and the infection is blocked.\\n\\nKilling infected cells: The Novavax vaccine can also trigger another kind of protection by destroying infected cells. When a coronavirus invades, infected cells put fragments of its spike protein on their surface. Antigen-presenting cells can activate a type of immune cell called a killer T cell. It can recognize coronavirus-infected cells and destroy them before they have a chance to produce new viruses.\\n\\nRemembering the virus: Novavax's vaccine would be easier to distribute and store than the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. While those vaccines have to be kept frozen, NVX-CoV2373 can stay stable for up to 3 months in a refrigerator. But if the vaccine does turn out to be effective, scientists won't know for sure how long it provides protection.\\n\\nIf it works like protein-based vaccines for other diseases, it may create a group of special cells called memory B cells and memory T cells. These cells will retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades, enabling a quick counterattack in response to a new infection.\\n\\nVaccine timeline\\n- January 2020: Novavax begins work on a coronavirus vaccine.\\n- May 2020: Novavax launches clinical trials for their vaccine.\\n- July 2020: The US government awards Novavax USD 1.6 billion to support the vaccine's clinical trials and manufacturing.\\n- August 2020: Novavax launched a Phase 2 trial on 2900 people in South Africa.\\n- September 2020: Novavax launches a Phase 3 trial with up to 15 000 volunteers in the United Kingdom. The trial is expected to deliver results in early 2021.\\n- 28 Dec 2020: Novavax launches a Phase 3 trial with 30 000 people in the United States. The trial had been delayed because of problems with manufacturing the doses required for the study.\\n- 2021: If its clinical trials succeed, Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses for use in the United States in 2021.\\n\\nSources: National Center for Biotechnology Information; Nature Reviews Immunology; Science; Maria Elena Bottazzi, Baylor College of Medicine; Matthew Frieman, University of Maryland School of Medicine.\\n\\n[byline: Jonathan Corum and Carl Zimmer]\\n\\n--\\ncommunicated by:\\nProMED\\n<promed@promedmail.org>\\n\\n[The protein-based Novavax vaccine is composed of the modified/stabilized form of the spike protein of the coronavirus that is packaged in nanoparticles for delivery tagged with an adjuvant to attract the immune system. This vaccine is administered by the intramuscular route, which is a simpler vaccine delivery system. The vaccine can be stored in a refrigerator, which gives it a clear advantage over the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines.\\n\\nThe Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 vaccine candidate Novovax has begun enrolling around 30 000 adult volunteers at approximately 115 sites in the USA and Mexico. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, are funding the trial (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-trial-novavax-investigational-covid-19-vaccine-opens).\\n\\nThe clinical trials are randomized and placebo-controlled, and after providing a baseline nasopharyngeal and blood sample, participants will be assigned at random to receive an intramuscular injection of either the investigational vaccine or a saline placebo. Randomization will be in a 2:1 ratio with 2 volunteers receiving the investigational vaccine for each one who receives placebo. Because the trial is blinded, neither investigators nor participants will know who is receiving the candidate vaccine. A 2nd injection will be administered 21 days after the 1st.\\n\\nParticipants will be followed closely for potential vaccine side effects and will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points after each injection and during the following 2 years. Scientists will analyze the blood samples to detect and quantify immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Of note, specialized assays will be used to distinguish between immunity as a result of natural infection and vaccine-induced immunity. The trial's primary endpoint is to determine whether NVX-CoV2373 can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease 7 or more days after the 2nd injection relative to placebo.\\n\\nOn animal testing, NVX-CoV2373 vaccination produced antibodies that blocked the coronavirus spike protein from binding to the cell surface receptors targeted by the virus, preventing viral infection. The results of a Phase 1 clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited higher levels of antibodies than those seen in blood samples drawn from people who had recovered from clinically significant COVID-19.\\n\\nNVX-CoV2373 also is being evaluated in a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, now fully enrolled with 4422 volunteers, and data from a Phase 1/2 continuation trial in the USA and Australia are expected as early as 1st quarter 2021.\\n\\nNovavax also recently completed enrollment of more than 15 000 volunteers in a Phase 3 trial of the candidate vaccine in the United Kingdom, which is also testing 2 injections of 5 mcg of protein and 50 mcg of Matrix-M adjuvant administered 21 days apart. - Mod.UBA]\\n\\n******\\n[3] Thailand update\\n[A]\\nDate: Wed 30 Dec 2020 2:57 AM PST\\nSource: The Seattle Times, The Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]\\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/business/asia-today-thailand-reports-250-new-coronavirus-cases/\\n\\n\\nThailand has reported 250 new cases of the coronavirus, including 241 local transmissions, as the country grapples with an intensifying outbreak of the virus.\\n\\nAfter months of seeming to have the COVID-19 situation under control, Thailand has seen 2 major clusters developing since mid-December [2020].

The new cases brought the accumulative totals to 63 deaths and 7163 cases, according to the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA).\\n\\nThe centre said the new fatalities, which brought the death toll to 63, were a man, 44, who had visited a restaurant in Bangkok on [20 Dec 2020] and a 70 year old man who had illegally entered the country along the border from Myanmar to Mae Sot district of Tak on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020].\\n\\nOf the 279 new cases, 257 were local infections. They included those linked to the clusters in Samut Sakhon (3), Rayong (2), and Chon Buri (1) while 16 had professions at risk of infection. The remaining 235 cases are being investigated.\\n\\nThe country is battling a new round of the COVID-19 outbreak that started in a few provinces, including Bangkok and Samut Sakhon, before spreading to 53 provinces on Thursday [31 Dec 2020]. Sa Kaeo and Lamphun were the latest additions to the list, it said.\\n\\nCCSA spokesman Taweesilp Visanuyothin said the centre was worried more cases would be found as people are travelling or returning to the provinces during the New Year holidays. The risk was travellers from the provinces plagued by the outbreak, he added, as they could transmit the disease to other people at home or tourist destinations. The 4-day holiday which started on Thursday [31 Dec 2020] ends on Sunday [3 Jan 2021].\\n\\nDr Taweesilp warned the situation remained serious and it could take some time for authorities to keep the situation under control. 'Do not expect the spread to end today or tomorrow,' he said, adding he expected the situation to ease in mid-February [2021].\\n\\nThe spokesman said the Public Health Ministry had ordered health provincial chiefs in Bangkok and 8 other provinces to strengthen health measures and consider closing all entertainment venues to contain the spread. The targeted provinces are Samut Sakhon, Samut Prakan, Samut Songkram, Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Chon Buri, and Rayong.\\n\\n--\\ncommunicated by:\\nProMED\\n<promed@promedmail.org>\\n\\n[Thailand has had a predominantly cluster-based COVID-19 transmission with success in interrupting transmission.
