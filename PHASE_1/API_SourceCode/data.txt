Most villagers earn their living by collecting and reselling trash. Huge sacks of waste are visible along the roads of Panguragan Kulon, many of them appearing to contain bottles.\n\nHowever, when CNA visited the village in mid-January [2020], a different type of waste was found at the backyard of a house: medical waste. Small needles, used hospital infusion bottles, and syringes with dried blood were just a few of the items scattered on the ground. Dozens of white gunny bags containing other medical waste such as medicine and little glass vials were also filling up a backyard around 150 sq m [about 1600 sq ft].\n\n\"I rented this house about 15 months ago. The garbage has always been there,\" [MM] told CNA. MM, 38, lives there with her husband and her children aged 13 and 23. They rented the house for 3 million rupiah (USD 220) per year, knowing that the backyard is filled with medical waste. \"Let it be ... we need the money,\" she said.\n\nWhen it was pointed out that there may be viruses in the waste, she said her family never went to the backyard anyway. \"I am not concerned ... We are never sick,\" said [M] who only finished the 2nd grade of elementary school. Her lack of concern was despite an investigation that concluded several years ago showing that the soil has been contaminated with various viruses, including traces of anthrax [anthrax is caused by a bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, not a virus - Mod.ML] and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].\n\nHer younger sister [N] was more worried. The 36-year-old, who lives a few miles away, claimed that the waste belongs to a man who worked for the military. In 2017, the man ordered people to dump the medical waste at the backyard of the house which belongs to a man she only knew as Mr [A]. It is said that Mr [A] then worked together with another man and ordered women to sort out the waste. Items that were considered recyclable were sold to someone else.\n\n\"People here are afraid of others who they think have authority. So they just let things be and didn't want to intervene. So even though people knew about it, no one said anything,\" [N] recounted. She also said that the women didn't mind doing the work due to economic reasons.\n\nOn average, the male villagers who sell reusable waste earn around 70 000 rupiah [about USD 5] per day. The women earn about 30 000 rupiah [about USD 2.2] per day for sorting out medical waste. \"The women didn't think that their job was dangerous sorting out needles. They don't complain. They don't think about the long term consequences,\" said [N], noting that the medical waste has actually contributed to the local economy.\n\nIn December 2017, authorities found out about the illegal practice and arrested the man who worked for the military, Mr [A], and another man. The 3 of them were sentenced to prison and the backyard was then sealed by authorities. But the medical waste remained.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, someone took off the seal and women started to come to the yard again, [N] said. When CNA went to the backyard, there was no one sorting out the medical waste.\n\nA middle-aged woman was doing her laundry at a house next to the illegal dump site. When approached, the woman said she was not afraid of living just next to the medical waste, as there was iron sheeting bordering her home and the dump site.\n\nTraces of anthrax [_Bacillus anthracis_] and HIV\n------------------------------------------------\nThe case in 2017 was handled by several government agencies, including the ministry of environment and forestry which visited the dump site for investigations. Mr Yazid Nurhuda, director of criminal enforcement of the ministry of environment and forestry, told CNA that the medical waste was dumped illegally. \"It is a criminal offense as regulated in the law number 32 of 2009,\" he noted.\n\nMr Anton Sardjanto, the deputy director for environmental pollution investigation at the ministry of environment and forestry, said there were 3 main suspects -- a man who was with the military and 2 civilians. Mr Sardjanto was on the ground in Panguragan Kulon investigating the case back in 2017. He recounted how the medical waste was still fresh and had a strong stench. He also said there were in total 6 illegal medical waste dump sites in Panguragan Kulon and surrounding areas.\n\nThe military man was dealt with by the Military Police Detachment, he said, adding that a one-year prison sentence was imposed. The 2 civilians, who were dealt with by the environment ministry, had also received prison sentences said Mr Sardjanto. There are also 2 other suspects, believed to have acted as middlemen, who are now on the run.\n\nHe said that while investigating the case, the authorities took samples of the waste. \"Clearly it was toxic and hazardous waste because it was infectious,\" he said. The ministry also took samples of the soil nearby to check for signs of environmental contamination. \"It turned out there was a lot of bacteria which we as common people would not know,\" said Mr Sardjanto.\n\nAn expert from the University of Indonesia was called during the trial as a witness expert. \"The expert said during the trial there was anthrax. He himself was a bit afraid to investigate the waste,\" Mr Sardjanto said. \"So it was very worrying because bacteria or viruses are dormant ... If the environment is supportive of them, they could develop. And this is something we cannot predict. There were many viruses, bacteria and others, including HIV,\" he stated.\n\nThe ministry is not aware that the seal for the dump site has since been removed.\n\nDue to limited budget, the ministry was not able to dispose of all the medical waste. Instead, it prioritised waste found near rivers and main roads. \"We are still trying to find a solution and because it is medical waste, it cannot be treated carelessly,\" Mr Sardjanto said.\n\nIt is not clear how the perpetrators had gotten hold of the medical waste. Typically, medical waste in Indonesia is burned at an incinerator. This process is usually carried out by major hospitals or companies specialising in medical waste management. They need to have a permit from the ministry of environment and forestry.\n\nThere are also medical waste transport companies involved in the process. Some of them have permits to manage the waste. \"Some private companies ... can be transporters but then dump the waste for reselling because if they burn it, they will get nothing,\" said Mr Sardjanto \"But it's illegal and then it is hard for us to monitor.\" Mr Sardjanto concluded: \"All environmental crime is tied to money. Everything. Like even lying and giving false information to officers ... Because our awareness of the environment is limited.\"\n\nMr Nurhuda of the environment ministry said that work is ongoing to prevent the recurrence of such cases. \"We are cooperating with the local regional government, with our toxic and hazardous waste processing partners and with the directorate general of toxic and hazardous waste processing to conduct joint surveillance. Hopefully, cases like this do not happen again,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Kiki Siregar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report raises all sorts of concerns. For starters, we have no reports of anthrax outbreaks on West Java, so how did _B. anthracis_ end up in \"medical\" waste and soil samples? My 1st suspicion is that it was from cross contamination in the microbiological laboratory doing the testing. If so, that raises other questions beyond the careless handling of laboratory waste. - Mod.MHJ\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Indonesia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40072]\nSee Also\nAnthrax - Indonesia (02): (YO) livestock, human 20200120.6900392\nAnthrax - Indonesia: (YO) cattle, human 20200116.6893679\n2017\n----\nAnthrax - Indonesia (04): (JK) livestock, no anthrax 20170901.5289293\nAnthrax - Indonesia (03): (GO) bovine 20170828.5280045\nAnthrax - Indonesia (02): (JT) laboratory results awaited 20170124.4789449\nAnthrax - Indonesia: (JT) bovine, human, susp 20170122.4782612\n2016\n----\nAnthrax - Indonesia (04): (GO) bovine, humans 20160621.4301232\nAnthrax - Indonesia (03): (SE) humans over-diagnosed 20160318.4104625\nAnthrax - Indonesia (02): (SE) human, bovine 20160312.4088737\nAnthrax - Indonesia: (SE) bovine, susp., RFI 20160310.4083988\n2014\n----\nAnthrax - Indonesia: (SE) livestock 20140210.2268748\n2013\n----\nAnthrax - Indonesia: (SE) human, equine source 20130601.1748961\n2012\n----\nAnthrax, bovine - Indonesia (SE) 20120608.1161664\n2011\n----\nAnthrax, human, livestock - Indonesia (02): (CV) 20110227.0647\nAnthrax, human, livestock - Indonesia: (CV) susp. 20110221.0572\n2010\n----\nHealth hazards, human, animal - worldwide: Hajj, Eid 20101112.4105\nAnthrax, bovine - Indonesia (04): (SE) bovine 20100407.1124\nAnthrax, bovine - Indonesia (03): (SE) human cases 20100405.1095\nAnthrax, bovine - Indonesia (02): (SE) human cases RFI 20100401.1040\nAnthrax, bovine - Indonesia (SE) 20100128.0302\n.................................................mhj/mj/ml", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6598319", "archive_id": "6598319", "date": "2019-07-31 14:38:45", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV drug resistance: WHO, 18 countries in Africa, Asia, Americas, 2014-2018", "main_text": "HIV DRUG RESISTANCE: WHO, 18 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA, AMERICAS, 2014-2018\n***************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 30 Jul 2019\nSource: Nature [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02316-x\n\n\nHealth authorities have uncovered an alarming surge in resistance to crucial HIV drugs. Surveys by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that, in the past 4 years, 12 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas have surpassed acceptable levels of drug resistance against 2 drugs that constitute the backbone of HIV treatment: efavirenz and nevirapine.\n\nPeople living with HIV are routinely treated with a cocktail of drugs, known as antiretroviral therapy, but the virus can mutate into a resistant form.\n\nThe WHO conducted surveys from 2014 to 2018 in randomly selected clinics in 18 countries, and examined the levels of resistance in people who had started HIV treatment during that period.\n\nMore than 10% of adults with the virus have developed resistance to these drugs in 12 nations [see Resistance Rises graphic at the source URL above]. Above this threshold, it's not considered safe to prescribe the same HIV medicines to the rest of the population because resistance could increase. Researchers published the findings this month [July 2019] in WHO report [1].\n\n\"I think we have kind of crossed the line,\" says Massimo Ghidinelli, an infectious-disease specialist at the Pan American Health Organization in Washington DC. Overall, 12% of women surveyed had a drug-resistant form of HIV, compared with 8% of men.\n\nParticularly concerning, says the report, is the high level of resistance in infants with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2012 and 2018, about one-half of newly diagnosed infants in 9 of the countries in this region had a form of HIV that was resistant to efavirenz, nevirapine or both.\n\nThe causes of drug resistance remain elusive, says Silvia Bertagnolio, an infectious-disease physician at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, and co-author of the report. But drug-resistant HIV might develop when people interrupt treatment, she suggests. For example, many women living with the virus might have taken antiretrovirals during pregnancy to prevent their babies from becoming infected, but stopped after delivery. The WHO recommended this practice until 2015, when it suggested that pregnant and breastfeeding women use the drugs for life.\n\nThe prevalence of resistance in people who restarted efavirenz and nevirapine after interrupting treatment was much higher (21%) than in first-time users (8%).\n\nPeople living with HIV might go on and off the drugs for several reasons. Stigma plays a huge part, says Bertagnolio; they might not want to be seen picking up their medicines. Drug shortages at clinics could also contribute, the report noted.\n\nIn response to the evidence, the WHO has recommended that countries use dolutegravir, which is more effective and tolerable than other therapies, as the go-to HIV drug. The likelihood that the virus will develop mutations and, eventually, resistance is lower with dolutegravir than with other antiretrovirals, says Roger Paredes, an infectious-disease physician at the Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. \"We have to encourage a worldwide transition to dolutegravir,\" he adds.\n\nBertagnolio agrees, but calls for caution. If treatment delivery is poor or patchy, resistance could emerge. \"We don't want to find ourselves in the same situation we're in.\"\n\n[1. HIV Drug Resistance Report 2019.

If it is not urgently addressed, it may result in millions of deaths, an increase in new and hard-to-treat infections and increased health-care costs (1). As a result, combatting AMR, including the threat posed by drug-resistant HIV, is a major goal for the global community. Prevention, monitoring and timely response to population levels of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is critical to achieving the WHO/UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for 2020 that 90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 90% of those who know their HIV-positive status are accessing treatment and 90% of the people receiving treatment having suppressed viral loads. These targets reflect the global community's commitment to eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. In response to the threat of HIVDR to attaining these goals, the global health community launched a 5-year Global Action Plan on HIVDR (2017-2021) that details a roadmap to prevent, monitor and respond to globally increasing levels of HIVDR. In response to the Global Action Plan, countries and funders are increasingly focusing on establishing robust and routine population-level monitoring of HIVDR to accompany the scaling up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and supporting a safe transition to new antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in 1st- and 2nd-line ART.\n\n\"Substantial progress has been made in monitoring the population-level emergence and transmission of HIVDR. Between 2004 and 2018, 49 countries implemented surveys of HIVDR using WHO-recommended standard methods. A further 35 countries have plans to conduct surveys (Fig. 1). This report presents findings from 44 nationally representative HIVDR surveys implemented in 24 low- and middle-income countries using WHO standard survey methods (2).\n\n\"In 12 of 18 countries reporting survey data to WHO between 2014 and 2018, levels of pretreatment HIVDR (PDR) to efavirenz (EFV) and/or nevirapine (NVP) among adults initiating 1st-line ART exceeded 10% (Fig. 2). Overall, levels of NNRTI PDR are nearly twice as high among women as among men.\n\n\"These findings are important, since women comprise a larger proportion of the population living with HIV globally and especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest burden of HIV infection. Another subpopulation at high risk of PDR is individuals reinitiating 1st-line ART and reporting previous exposure to ARV drugs (for example, for preventing the mother-to-child transmission of HIV, previous ART for treating HIV infection, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) believed to have been taken since the person became HIV positive). Twelve of 18 surveys included both ARV drug-naive ART initiators and ART starters reporting previous exposure to ARV drugs.\n\n\"Among 1st-line ART initiators reporting prior ARV drug exposure, PDR to efavirenz and/or nevirapine is nearly 3 times higher than among ARV drug-naive individuals starting ART.\n\n\"These findings are relevant, since the proportion of people starting treatment reporting previous ARV drug exposure ranged from 1.2% to 26.3% in countries reporting data and is projected to increase with the continuing global scale-up of ART.\n\n\"A concerted global response to increasing levels of PDR is of paramount priority to WHO and its global partners. In 2017, WHO issued guidelines recommending using an alternative 1st-line regimen that does not contain efavirenz or nevirapine in countries in which resistance to these drugs exceeds 10% (1). In addition, 2018 WHO ARV guidelines recommended the rapid adoption of dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens as the preferred 1st-line treatment for adults and children that, if implemented, will help avert the negative effects of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).\n\n\"The prevalence of PDR among children 18 months or younger diagnosed with HIV through national early infant diagnosis programmes is alarmingly high. Based on surveys conducted in 9 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 2012 and 2018, over half of the infants newly diagnosed with HIV carry a virus that is resistant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine. Levels of PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) also exceed 10% in some countries.\n\nSince 2013, WHO has recommended using protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART regimens for children younger than 3 years old, and in 2018 WHO formally encouraged the phaseout of NNRTIs across age groups, with the introduction of DTG for children with approved dosing. However, in 2017, globally nearly 77% of young children were still receiving nevirapine in 1st-line ART because of limited supplies of child-friendly drug formulations (1). Continual efforts to expand the capacity of manufacturing lopinavir/ritonavir pellets formulations and to accelerate the investigation and introduction of DTG across lower weight bands are required since the very high levels of PDR make NNRTI-based ART highly suboptimal. Levels of PDR to NRTIs, including abacavir (ABC), are also high in some countries, underscoring the need to routinely monitor population levels of resistance, especially when ABC is given in combination with drugs with relatively low genetic barriers to selecting drug resistance such as NNRTIs or raltegravir (a 1st-generation integrase inhibitor).\n\n\"Achieving the third 90 target for maximal viral load suppression, thereby preventing the emergence and transmission of HIVDR, is critical for eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.\n\n\"Three of the 9 countries reporting findings from acquired drug resistance (ADR) surveys among adults receiving HIV treatment between 2014 and 2018 showed levels of viral suppression exceeding 90%. Across all the surveys, the prevalence of ADR among people receiving ART ranged from 3% to 29%. Among populations receiving NNRTI-based ART with viral non-suppression, the levels of NNRTI and NRTI resistance ranged from 50% to 97% and from 21% to 91%, respectively. Estimates of dual class resistance (NNRTI and NRTI) ranged between 21% and 91% of individuals for whom NNRTI-based 1st-line ART failed.\n\n\"The high level of HIVDR among people with viral non-suppression on NNRTI-based 1st-line ART demonstrates the degree to which NNRTI-based regimens are compromised for people with viral non-suppression detected by a single viral load test, indicating the need for rapid switch to 2nd-line ART once failure to suppress viral loads is identified. Equally, the high levels of NRTI resistance at time of treatment failure, including dual-class NRTI resistance, support the need for optimizing the NRTI backbone during treatment switch, as recommended in WHO's 2019 antiretroviral guidelines.\n\n\"In addition to routine population-level monitoring of HIVDR, preventing drug-resistant HIV is one of the strategic objectives of the Global Action Plan on HIVDR. WHO recommends monitoring and responding to gaps in quality indicators at the clinic or programme level that are associated with the emergence of HIVDR. These indicators include appropriate prescribing practices, on-time ART pill pick-up (a proxy measure of adherence), retention on ART at 12 months, viral load testing coverage, viral load suppression, ARV drug stock-outs and timely switch to 2nd-line ART. Between 2014 and 2018, 44 of 45 countries with a high burden of HIV reported these data to WHO. Overall data reporting across all the indicators was incomplete, suggesting the need for strengthening systems for monitoring data indicating programme quality.\n\n\"Few countries are attaining the expected targets for quality-of-care indicators, suggesting the need for a proactive approach in addressing gaps in the quality of ART service delivery and minimizing the emergence and spread of HIVDR. Retention on ART at 12 months emerges as a programmatic area requiring significant attention and further improvement.\" - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\n2006\n----\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City): 2005 20060727.2075\n2005\n----\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (06) 20050727.2177\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (05) 20050326.0876\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (04) 20050225.0604\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (03) 20050222.0568\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (02) 20050216.0522\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476\n2001\n----\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - Canada (British Columbia) 20010810.1892\n.................................................sb/ml/rd/lm", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6551457", "archive_id": "6551457", "date": "2019-07-04 12:31:57", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV/AIDS - Pakistan (02): (SD) WHO", "main_text": "HIV/AIDS - PAKISTAN (02): (SINDH) WHO\n*************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 3 Jul 2019\nSource: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]\nhttps://www.who.int/csr/don/03-july-2019-hiv-cases-pakistan/en/\n\n\nOn 25 Apr 2019, the local administration in Larkana district [Sindh] was alerted by media reports of a surge in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases among children in Ratodero Taluka, Larkana district, Sindh province, Pakistan. A screening camp was initially established at Taluka's main hospital. Later, screening was expanded to other health facilities including selected Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs). HIV rapid test kits that were initially used were replaced with pre-qualified WHO test kits.\n\nFrom 25 Apr through 28 Jun 2019, a total of 30 192 people have been screened for HIV, of which 876 were found positive. 82% (719/876) of these were below the age of 15 years. During the screening, several risk factors were identified, including: unsafe intravenous injections during medical procedures; unsafe child delivery practices; unsafe practices at blood banks; poorly implemented infection control programs; and improper collection, storage, segregation, and disposal of hospital waste.\n\nThis is the 4th reported outbreak of HIV in Larkana district since 2003. The 1st outbreak in 2003, was among people who inject drugs (PWID), the 2nd was among 12 pediatric patients in a pediatric hospital in 2016, and the 3rd, also in 2016, was among 206 patients in a dialysis unit.\n\nPrior to this event, Larkana district had only one antiretroviral [ARV] therapy (ART) clinic, which was for adults exclusively (2568 registered cases by May 2019).\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe response to the event has been led by the provincial Department of Health (DOH) and the Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP). The response has been supported by UN partners, the Pakistan Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), Aga Khan University, and other partners.\n\nA new HIV/AIDS ART Treatment Center for children has been established at Shaikh Zaid Children Hospital. Unauthorized laboratories, blood banks, and clinics have been closed.\n\nA mission led by the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH) and WHO, supported by other UN partners and academia has been conducted through the first half of June. The objectives were to identify sources and chains of transmission of HIV, map the high-risk areas, and identify gaps in HIV diagnosis, care and treatment.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nPakistan is one of the countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region where new HIV infections are increasing at an alarming level since 1987 [1]. The current HIV epidemic in Pakistan is defined as a concentrated epidemic. Although the overall prevalence is still less than 1% in the adult population, the latest estimate (2017) of people living with HIV (PLHIV) was 150 000 [2] . In 2018, 21 000 new PLHIV cases were recorded.\n\nRegarding this event, the overall risk of disease spread within Larkana district is high due to:\n- non-availability of sufficient information to determine the complete extent and magnitude of the event;\n- number of cases among children (mostly under 5 years age group);\n- date/period of exposure of HIV to the cases is unknown;\n- lack of information regarding all possible sources of exposure;\n- insufficient treatment options due to lack of appropriate ARV drugs;\n- history of repeated HIV outbreaks in the same geographical area;\n\nFurther epidemiological investigations will help determine the magnitude of the event, and whether this event is acute and isolated in nature, or a longer duration situation with these cases (accidentally diagnosed) representing the tip of the iceberg of a larger epidemic.\n\nThe risk at regional and global levels is considered very low because the mode of transmission of HIV is very specific and limited to mother to child transmission, contact with contaminated blood through contaminated syringes/other surgical instruments, blood transfusion, or sexual contact with PLHIV. The situation is being closely monitored, and the risk will be re-assessed according to the results of the preliminary investigation.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nThis event highlights the importance of using high-impact interventions to reduce vulnerability and prevent transmission mainly in healthcare settings. It also takes into consideration the prevention of sexual transmission in high risk groups, transmission through injecting drug use, and mother-to-child transmission.\n\nWHO recommends that after 18 months of age, 3 different assays may be required to establish the diagnosis of HIV infection. However, infants less than 18 months of age who are born to HIV infected mother should be diagnosed through nucleic acid testing (NAT) [3].\n\nWHO stresses the importance of immediately linking all those diagnosed with HIV infection to antiretroviral treatment (ART), where the test should be repeated to rule out errors in diagnosis (in case 2nd test is negative [4]) and, thereafter, ART should be started without any delay.\n\n1.

The team will work closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners.\n\nMoreover, the Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division (FEDSD) of NIH has issued an advisory regarding the prevention and control of HIV. The aim of the advisory is to alert public health authorities across Pakistan to take necessary steps for prevention and control of HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections propagated by unsafe equipment and syringes as well as blood transfusion.\n\nAccording to the advisory, more than 700 HIV cases have thus far been detected in Sindh, highlighting gross inadequacies in the healthcare system, especially with regard to infection control practices. \"The infection is disproportionately affecting children and while scientific investigations are currently underway to ascertain the causative factors, the involvement of young kids born to HIV-negative mothers points to a significant role being played by poor infection prevention and control practices, injection malpractices, and reuse of contaminated syringes,\" the Executive Director of NIH Dr Aamer Ikram has flagged in his covering letter to the advisory.\n\nThe advisory states that HIV can be transmitted from person to person through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner; from contaminated needles, syringes, and other sharp injecting instruments; from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth and through feeding; and from transfusion of HIV-infected blood and blood products. Once in the bloodstream, the retrovirus infects CD4 cells, resulting in progressive deterioration of the immune system and leading to HIV. A person is said to have AIDS when the infection progresses, dropping the CD4 count to below 200. On average, the time from HIV infection to clinical AIDS is 8 to 10 years though AIDS may manifest in less than two years or be delayed in onset beyond 10 years.\n\nThe comprehensive advisory provides definition of confirmed HIV-infected and AIDS cases, as well as ways for prompt diagnosis and effective management and prevention of HIV and AIDS. What protocols to follow for disease surveillance and notification, and risk communication and health education are also listed in the advisory.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Risk of HIV spread\nDate: Sun 2 Jun 2019\nSource: The News International (Pakistan) [edited]\nhttps://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/479272-exclusive-the-global-fund-fears-possible-spread-of-hiv-into-general-population-in-pakistan\n\n\nThe Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria [Sat 1 Jun 2019] said that it is worried about a possible spread of HIV into general population in Pakistan as recent outbreak in Ratodero area of Larkana (and many outbreaks before) is just a symptom of a deeper crisis.\n\n\"The spread of HIV in Pakistan is worrying. Long time thought to be contained in high risk groups, notably injecting drug users, it is now on the verge of spilling into the general population. Larkana (and the many outbreaks before in Pakistan) is just a symptom of a deeper crisis. There is no reason for panic, but also no justification for denial,\" said Dr Werner Buehler, Senior Fund Portfolio Manager at the Global Fund in Geneva in response to written queries from The News International.\n\nResponding to queries from The News regarding HIV/AIDS situation in Pakistan and a possible procurement of antiretroviral medicines for HIV infected children in Ratodero area of Pakistan, the Global Fund official confirmed that the fund has started procurement of pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART/ARVs) medicines for the children infected with HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana, Sindh \"through our Rapid Supply Mechanism, after consultation with WHO on the most appropriate regimens.\"\n\n\"We have indeed started procuring paediatric ARV, through our Rapid Supply Mechanism, after consultation with WHO on the most appropriate regimens,\" Dr Werner Buehler said in his email to this scribe.\n\nOver 742 people including 605 children have so far been tested positive for HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana since [25 Apr 2019], officials of Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP) said, adding that majority of the children (411) were of 2 to 5 years of age while 57 were of less than one year's age.\n\nFollowing reports of deaths of some children due to HIV/AIDS related co-infections in the Ratodero area of Larkana, World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Pakistan had said that they had requested the Global fund to provide pediatric ART medicines for around 500 children under the age of five years who could not take drug in tablet forms.\n\nSACP Program Manager Dr Sikandar Memon said at the moment, they already had 420 infected with HIV in Sindh who were registered with them and getting ART medicines regularly that were being provided by the Global Fund and added that also started giving ARTs to around 190 newly diagnosed children at Paediatric HIV treatment center in Larkana.\n\nThe Global Fund official maintained that they are providing treatment for roughly 15 000 people living with HIV in Pakistan, saying: \"We have seen massive increases of numbers of people on ART in the past 4-5 years, mostly due to revised treatment guidelines and expanded and decentralized testing in the drug user community. This is a good development, as individuals on ART can no longer spread the virus and can lead healthy and normal lives.\"\n\n\"But it has financial consequences,\" said Dr Buehler. \"The Global Fund is still the only funding source for ART in Pakistan. There is an urgent need for the Government (of Pakistan) to plan and pay for domestic drug procurement. There is also a need to decentralize HIV service delivery (and testing) as much as possible. Only then can we overcome one of the biggest obstacles to treatment, that is, distance,\" he added.\n\nDr Werner Buehler maintained that the Global Fund will continue to support Pakistan's fight against HIV for the foreseeable future. \"We try our best to prevent more human suffering, but we do realize that the roughly USD 12 million the Fund spends on HIV in Pakistan per year may not be enough at this stage. We hope that Government finds the resources to intensify the fight.\"\n\nThe Global fund official said media and independent journalism have a major role to play in raising general awareness over the nature of HIV. That supposes that more and more journalists acquire technical knowledge about the epidemic, its causes, its treatment, its prevention, in order to comment critically on the situation and to repeat the right messages at every opportunity.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Activities of WHO mission on HIV in Pakistan\nDate: Fri 31 May 2019\nSource: Dawn [edited]\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1485543\n\n\nThe team of World Health Organisation that arrived in the country on [Tue 28 May 2019] to probe reasons behind the spread of HIV and investigate from where the virus had travelled to the area, visited the children's treatment centre for HIV/AIDS in Chandka Medical College children's hospital on [Thu 30 May 2019] and inquired the staff about how they handled the patients.\n\nThe team asked project manager of Sindh AIDS Control Programme who accompanied them about the facilities and the protocol for treating AIDS patients. On [Fri 31 May 2019], the team members would visit Ratodero taluka hospital to personally observe the ongoing process of blood screening for HIV, said sources.\n\nBefore the visit of the healthcare facility, the WHO team held a meeting with Sindh Minister for Health Dr Azra Pechuho and other stakeholders at Darbar Hall to review the overall situation regarding the outbreak of HIV/AIDS in Ratodero and the efforts put in so far to fight the virus.\n\nOlive Morgan, the team leader, told that meeting that the scope of the delegation was to dig out the reasons behind the spread of the deadly disease and also see from where it had travelled to the area.\n\nHe said that WHO was ready to help patients suffering from the deadly virus. The participants in the meeting exchanged views and discussed certain proposals as to how best to handle the situation. The delegation also handed over AIDS medicines to the minister.\n\nThe minister said that since the outbreak of the virus, the health department had set up blood screening camps in and around Ratodero to test the population and opened treatment centers in hospitals. She termed the situation a 'challenge' and expressed optimism about overcoming it in near future.\n\nThe minister accompanied by health officials later visited blood screening centre in Ratodero taluka hospital where she told reporters that the WHO delegates were working on different diseases and they would provide the Sindh government a detailed study report on HIV/AIDS.\n\nShe said that both Global Fund and Sindh government were financially contributing towards efforts to combat the virus and \"we are planning to systematically and scientifically spend the funds.\" She claimed a 'drop' in the virus' intensity and said that people were very afraid of the virus.\n\nShe said that so far 712 persons had been diagnosed as HIV positive at the blood screening centre at Ratodero and announced that WHO and other stakeholders would help Sindh government in establishing good treatment centers.\n\nShe said that during their stay the foreign delegates would interact with different communities, visit blood screening camps and treatment centers and compile a report with the findings and reasons which led to the virus' spread.\n\nSecretary for health Dr Saeed Ahmed Magnejo, Larkana commissioner Saleem Raza Khuhro, project manager of Sindh AIDS Control Programme Dr Sikandar Memon, deputy commissioner, representatives of PPHI, Expanded Programme of Immunisation, and district health officer attended the meeting.\n\nA total of 15, 11 among them children, tested positive for HIV during ongoing blood screening test at Ratodero taluka hospital where 286 persons were screened on [Thu 30 May 2019]. Among them 4 were adults (one male and 3 females) and 11 were children (6 boys and 5 girls), said sources.\n\nGhulam Yaseen Vessar, deputy director of anti-quackery section of the Sindh Healthcare Commission, sealed 9 healthcare facilities on the outskirts of Larkana after raids.\n\nMr Vessar said that the health facilities were either run by quacks or their premises were found unfit for being clinics. 3 clinic owners had been warned to rectify shortfalls or face action, he said. So far 189 clinics had been sealed and 61 had been issued warning, he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] WHO update\nDate: Tue 28 May 2019\nSource: WHO, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) News [edited]\nhttp://www.emro.who.int/pak/pakistan-news/who-supports-response-to-hiv-outbreak-in-sindh-pakistan.html\n\n\nWHO supports response to HIV outbreak in Sindh, Pakistan\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAn international team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) has arrived in Pakistan to support the response to an outbreak of HIV in Larkana in Sindh province, Pakistan, at the request of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination.\n\nThe outbreak was first reported on 25 Apr 2019, and a major HIV screening programme started on 28 Apr 2019. It was expanded on 8 May 2019, with additional health workers being deployed. Testing is ongoing.\n\nSo far more than 600 HIV cases have been identified. The majority are among children and young people: more than half those affected are children under the age of 5. This poses a particular challenge. Prior to this outbreak, there were just over 1200 children diagnosed with HIV and receiving antiretroviral treatment in the whole of Pakistan.\n\nOn 16 May 2019 local authorities established a new antiretroviral treatment clinic for children in Larkana.\n\nKey tasks for the WHO-led team will include: ascertaining the source of the outbreak and controlling it; providing technical expertise, particularly in the areas of HIV testing, paediatric HIV treatment and family counselling; and ensuring adequate supplies of rapid diagnostic tests and antiretroviral medicines for both adults and children, as well as single-use needles and syringes.\n\nThe WHO mission will include experts in emergency response management, epidemiology, HIV clinical care, and infection prevention and control from WHO as well as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The team will work closely with the Ministry and partners, including the Aga Khan University, Pakistan's Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), UNAIDS, and UNICEF in Larkana.\n\nFor more information contact:\nMs Maryam Yunus\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Country Office, Pakistan\n<yunusm@who.int>\n\nDr Safdar Kamal Pasha\nNational Programme Officer, HIV/AIDS\nWHO Country Office, Pakistan\n<mpasha@who.int>\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[On 25 Apr 2019, the local administration in Larkana, Sindh province in Pakistan was alerted following diagnosis of 13 HIV positive cases among children in Ratodero taluka of Larkana. A screening camp was established at the taluka's (governing unit) main hospital. Initial HIV testing was done using HIV rapid test kits, which were not WHO pre-qualified. Later screening was expanded to other health facilities at the lower level of health care delivery, including selected Rural Health Centres (RHCs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs). As of 3 Jun 2019, 25 856 people were screened of which 742 (2.9 percent) were found to be HIV positive. Most of the diagnosed cases are children (607, 81 percent), mostly under 5-year-old with an overall very high proportion of children among people tested (https://www.nacp.gov.pk/).\n\nThis the 4th reported HIV outbreak in Larkana district since 2003. Risk factors identified were unsafe IV injections during medical practice, unsafe delivery practices, unhygienic control measures, unsafe practices at blood banks, poorly implemented harm reduction programmes, and improper hospital waste management.\n\nThe current HIV epidemic in Pakistan is defined as a concentrated epidemic (http://www.emro.who.int/pak/programmes/hiv-aids.html). the epidemic is expanding among injecting drug users, with an estimated prevalence of 20 percent, and their sexual contacts, including male and transgender hijra sex workers, with rates of 2 percent-3 percent and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nLike many developing countries, Pakistan faces elevated risk of HIV transmission as a result of poverty, low literacy, gender-related discrimination, ignorance about modes of transmission and the stigma that prohibits people with risk behaviours from seeking HIV testing or disclosing their HIV positive status. Although the overall prevalence is still less than 1 percent in the adult population, the latest estimates of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is 150 000. In 2018, 21 000 new infections were recorded. In Sindh Province where Larkana district belongs, the HIV/AIDS response is spearheaded by Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP). The HIV service delivery is limited and mostly focused on key populations (injectable drug users, sex workers) in Karachi and Larkana districts.\n\nThe recommendations of the WHO expert mission and national experts on the ground will be helpful in determining the risk factors associated with this outbreak, confirmation of the outbreak (whether this is new or has been going on for some time and detected now) and planning the immediate, medium, and long term activities. - Mod.UBA\n\nMaps of Pakistan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/707 and https://geology.com/world/pakistan-province-map.gif (provinces)]\nSee Also\nFor background information, the following ProMED-SoAs posts can be found at http://www.promedmail.org/soas\n\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (08): (Sindh) update 20190531.6488072\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (07): (Sindh) update 20190522.6476645\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (06): (Sindh) update 20190516.6471136\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (05): (Sindh) situation update 20190513.6465262\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (04): (BA) 20190512.6466269\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (03): (Sindh) situation update 20190508.6457512\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan (02): (Sindh) children 20190428.6442208\nHIV/AIDS - Pakistan: (Islamabad Capital Territory) 20190102.6238338\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................uba/mj/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6466285", "archive_id": "6466285", "date": "2019-05-12 15:00:06", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - USA: (NM) cosmetic use of PRP, contaminated needles, RFI", "main_text": "HIV - USA: (NEW MEXICO) COSMETIC USE OF PLATELET RICH PLASMA, CONTAMINATED NEEDLES, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n***********************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 2 May 2019\nSource: Global Industry Reports [edited]\nhttp://globalindustryreports.us/131/two-person-test-positive-for-hiv-after-vampire-facials-new-mexico/\n\n\nTwo people in New Mexico have tested positive for HIV after getting vampire facials on 2 May 2019.\n\nAs per the news report, the VIP Spa in old town Albuquerque (the largest city in New Mexico) shut down last year [2018] after reports of an unidentified infection being imparted to the visitors. Now, it has been made public that 2 visitors had contracted HIV after obtaining a vampire facial.\n\nA vampire facial is a common phrase for platelet-rich plasma therapy treatments. These treatments typically include blood from a consumer's arm being removed for the platelet-rich plasma through a centrifuge (a piece of equipment) and then reuse to the patient's face. While doing this could leave the patient with a more youthful appearance, if not done properly then he/she subjected to blood-borne infections.\n\nAfter conducting an investigation, the New Mexico Department of Health stated that unsafe storage and handling of needles caused the donor to contract HIV. The New Mexico Department of Health has since disclosed a statement urging consumers who have [been] getting vampire facials from the VIP Spa in May or June of 2018 to test for HIV and hepatitis A and B [? Hepatitis viruses A, as well as hepatitis E, are spread by fecal contamination and are rarely considered blood borne pathogens. The other hepatitis B and C viruses are blood borne. - Mod.ML]. These tests may be directed for free.\n\nWhile over 100 VIP Spa clients have already been tested, the New Mexico Department of Health is reaching out to ensure that testing and counseling services are available for each individual receiving injection-related services at the VIP Spa, Secretary of Health Kathy Kunkel stated. Testing is important for everybody, as there are effective treatments for HIV and many hepatitis infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Platelets contain many bioactive proteins that are thought to be active in tissue healing (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338460/). Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a biological product in which the plasma fraction of autologous blood has a platelet concentration above the baseline. Its use in tissue regeneration, wound healing, scar revision, and skin rejuvenation has become increasingly popular (https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/477353). However, the effectiveness of PRP remains controversial (https://www.healio.com/orthopedics/sports-medicine/news/print/orthopedics-today/%7Bbac6fbfd-a204-479f-ae5f-ca3a4f3081d1%7D/platelet-rich-plasma-promises-pain-relief-and-healing-but-remains-controversial).\n\nPlatelet rich plasma (PRP) is obtained from a sample of patients' blood drawn at the time of treatment, and, after the addition of an anticoagulant, processed immediately by differential centrifugation into autologous concentrated PRP via commercially available PRP kits (https://www.harvesttech.com/clinician/clinician-home/harvest-platelet-concentrate-system and https://drprpusa.com/product/prp-kit-sample-with-accessories/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_4770_uU4gIVDV8NCh0pdA5rEAMYASAAEgLJU_D_BwE) or in-house schemes (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338460/).\n\nThe news report above says the New Mexico Department of Health found that the cause for the donors to contract HIV was \"unsafe storage and handling of needles,\" and others who got \"vampire facials\" from the VIP Spa in May or June of 2018 may have been similarly exposed to HIV and hepatitis B. However, the exact mechanism for contamination of the needles was not disclosed.

Schistosomiasis is associated with incident HIV transmission and death in Zambia. PLOS Negl Trop Dis 2018;12:e0006902.\n\nAbstract\n---------\nBackground\nWe examined relationships between schistosome infection, HIV transmission or acquisition, and all-cause death.\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively tested baseline sera from a heterosexual HIV-discordant couple cohort in Lusaka, Zambia with follow-up from 1994-2012 in a nested case-control design. Schistosome-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA. Associations between baseline antibody response to schistosome antigens and incident HIV transmission, acquisition, and all-cause death stratified by gender and HIV status were assessed. In a subset of HIV-negative women and HIV-positive men, we performed immunoblots to evaluate associations between _Schistosoma haematobium_ or _Schistosoma mansoni_ infection history and HIV incidence.\n\nResults\nOf 2145 individuals, 59% had positive baseline schistosome-specific antibody responses. In HIV-positive women and men, baseline schistosome-specific antibodies were associated with HIV transmission to partners (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.8, P less than 0.005 and aHR = 1.4, P less than 0.05, respectively) and death in HIV-positive women (aHR = 2.2, P less than 0.001). In 250 HIV-negative women, presence of _S. haematobium_-specific antibodies was associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition (aHR = 1.4, P less than 0.05).\n\nConclusion\nSchistosome infections were associated with increased transmission of HIV from both sexes, acquisition of HIV in women, and increased progression to death in HIV-positive women. Establishing effective prevention and treatment strategies for schistosomiasis, including in urban adults, may reduce HIV incidence and death in HIV-positive persons living in endemic areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The study underlines the importance of lesions from schistosomiasis in the male and female reproductive organs, which may lead to macro and micro haemorrhage into, for instance, semen and mucosal lesions.

The patient arrived to Oman on [12 Nov 2018] and was brought immediately to our hospital. His renal function tests were grossly abnormal and he required urgent hemodialysis. DTPA renogram and Abdominal CT angiography confirmed acute rejection due to graft infarction. On the [15 Nov 2018] he underwent a transplantectomy of an infarcted kidney. Histopathology findings were consistent with renal infarction.\n\nHe was screened regularly -- every 3 months -- for HIV according to hemodialysis unit standards; the last HIV negative test was from [2 Oct 2018]. The patient received plasmapheresis on [5 Nov 2018].\n\nThe 1st reactive HIV test was done on [12 Nov 2018] by Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo chemiluminescent assay with index of 120. This reactivity was not confirmed by Bio-rad Geenius (TM) HIV 1/2 Confirmatory assay (with no single reactive band). Acute HIV infection was detected by testing a plasma sample, collected on [19 Nov 2018], with HIV viral load of 11 800 copies/ml (log10 5.07) using Roche cobas(R)4800 for HIV-1 system. A repeat HIV serology sample by ROCHE Elecsys(R) HIV combi PT (e411) ECL assay from [22 Nov 2018], was also reactive, with index of 86.5. This time the confirmatory Geenius (TM) assay detected a single gp41 band. A repeat HIV viral load from [27 Nov 2018] showed very HIV RNA of more than 10000000 copies/ml (log10 more than 7.0 ).\nOn [29 Nov 2018] the patient was started on ART that included: zidovudine 100mg tid , lamivudine 50mg od and raltegravir 400mg bid.\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nDr Faryal Khamis,\nInfectious Diseases,\nThe Royal Hospital, Muscat,\nSultanate of Oman.\n<khami001@gmail.com>\n\n[The transplant cost the patient 41 500 USD. The cost cannot be retrieved after the failed transplant. It is usual that commercial kidney transplants performed in Pakistan receive heavy immunosuppression and are discharged very soon to their home country before complications appear. Usually no written report of the procedure or information about the donor is given to the recipient.\n\nA study of \"kidneys for sale\" on social media [22 Jun 2015 to 19 Feb 2016] on Twitter, Google answers, and Facebook found a total of 557 advertisements on organ trade (Alrogy W, Jawdat D, Alsemari M, Alharbi A, Alasaad A, Hajeer AH. Organ trade using social networks. Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl. 2016;27:971-6; < http://www.sjkdt.org/article.asp?issn=1319-2442;year=2016;volume=27;issue=5;spage=971;epage=976;aulast=Alrogy>). Comparison across 12 medical outcomes indicates that transplant tourists are significantly more likely to contract cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B, HIV, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, and wound infection than those receiving domestic kidney transplant (Anker AE and Feeley TH. Estimating the risks of acquiring a kidney abroad: a meta-analysis of complications following participation in transplant tourism. Clin Transplant. 2012;26:E232-41; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1399-0012.2012.01629.x).\n\nA study following 36 commercial (illegal) kidney transplants performed in Pakistan found that the patients had not been cleared for transplantation with a standard pre-transplant work-up: 80% were hepatitis-C virus (HCV) or HBsAg positive. During follow-up, 7 patients died, 16 patients experienced wound infections with post-operative hernias, and 3 developed peri-renal hematomas. A total of 6 abscesses and 4 lymphoceles occurred, and 4 urinary fistulas were surgically treated. Transplantectomy [removal of the transplanted kidney] was performed in 3 patients because of renal artery thrombosis. As many as 9 patients developed active hepatitis C, and 4 patients manifested cytomegalovirus disease. Three patients developed steroid-induced diabetes, and 3 experienced acute myocardial infarction. Nine patients had one or more rejection episodes. Urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas or Escherichia occurred frequently. The one-yr patient and graft survival rates were 80% and 68%, respectively (Ivanovski N, Masin J, Rambabova-Busljetic I, et al. The outcome of commercial kidney transplant tourism in Pakistan. Clin Transplant. 2011;25:171-3; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01299.x).\n\nThus it is clear that kidneys are offered for sale through social media. The study by Ivanovski N et al. clearly demonstrate that clinical outcomes are substandard. One wonders if there is any attempt to match tissue types between donor and recipient, or screen the donors for chronic infections. In addition, the immunosuppression after transplant is probably more severe than standard to avoid immediate rejection before the patient returns to his or her home country, leading to a high incidence of bacterial and fungal infections.\n\nThe authorities have a responsibility to try and control this criminal activity. Other countries have an obligation to increase the availability of organs, for instance introducing legislation allowing persons with irreversible brain damage to be donors unless they explicitly said no before the brain injury, and not as it is in many countries, that persons can only be used as donors if the explicitly chose to be donors in case they suffer irreversible brain damage. - Mod.EP\n\nHealthMap/ProMED maps available at:\nOman: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/124\nPakistan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/140]\nSee Also\n(none)\n.................................................ep/ao/lxl", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6010223", "archive_id": "6010223", "date": "2018-09-05 20:30:52", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Syphilis - Brazil: ocular, HIV-negative", "main_text": "SYPHILIS - BRAZIL: OCULAR, HIV-NEGATIVE\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 6 Sep 2018\nSource: Insight News [edited]\nhttps://www.insightnews.com.au/Article3/1821/Warning-over-syphilis-related-vision-loss\n\n\nAn Australian uveitis specialist has warned that people are at risk of unnecessarily losing sight due to a sharp increase in the number of ocular syphilis cases being recorded around the world.\n\nOphthalmologist and uveitis specialist Professor Justine Smith from Flinders University [Australia] said that while the disease is easily treatable, its symptoms were often misdiagnosed as other conditions due to its previously low rates of infection. Smith recently collaborated on the largest ocular syphilis study ever undertaken with researchers in Brazil, which identified 127 cases across 4 clinics over a 2.5-year period [1].\n\n\"If you want to understand a disease as it's happening right at the moment, you need a large population to work with, and Brazil has 10x the population of Australia,\" Smith explained. \"The infection manifests in similar ways in different populations, so that was a reason why this was a great collaboration.\"\n\nNearly 90 of the patients reported in the study were suffering inflammation in both eyes, and exams had revealed that some had suffered structural and functional complications inside the eye, such as retinal detachment. However, according to Smith, these symptoms are easily treated with penicillin if they're detected early enough.\n\n\"Anyone who presents at our clinic with inflammation in the eye, we test for syphilis. It will be a minority of those people who have syphilis in the eye, but you don't want to miss even one, because it's very treatable,\" she said. \"You can get the results back within a day; it's really cheap; it's very robust testing now, and the treatment takes about 2 weeks, and that gets rid of it.\"\n\nStatistics from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicate a sharp increase in the number of people diagnosed with syphilis recently. In 2015, there were 7.5 cases per 100 000 persons, which represented the highest annual number and the highest rate of reported syphilis cases in approximately 20 years, and a 19% increase since 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, during 2012-2016, the Australian notification rate of infectious syphilis increased 107% from 6.9 per 100 000 to 14.3 per 100 000. A recent ABC report also indicated the disease had reached \"epidemic proportions\" in North Queensland, where more than 1100 cases had been recorded since 2008, a year in which only 2 new cases were identified.\n\nThe most common symptom of ocular syphilis is blurry vision, but Smith says more than half of the patients studied lost vision to below driving level. \"Patients didn't present to clinics for treatment until they had a problem for some months, but it is not completely the fault of the patient. Doctors are no longer accustomed to seeing syphilis these days, so it may not be picked up for an extended period of time, during which patients may develop eye complications,\" she said. \"Our most important observation is the role of testing in making a timely diagnosis of ocular syphilis, which should limit the risk of vision loss.\"\n\n[1.

We conducted a large observational study of 127 persons consecutively treated for ocular syphilis at public medical centers in Brazil over a 2.5-year period ending July 2015. Of 104 individuals serologically tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 34.6% were positive. Ophthalmological evaluations included measurement of Snellen visual acuity and intraocular pressure, and assessment of inflammation by slit lamp examination and dilated posterior eye examination. Involvements in 214 eyes were anterior (6.1%), intermediate (8.4%), posterior (76.2%) and pan- (8.4%) uveitis, and scleritis (0.9%). Multiple anterior and posterior eye complications were observed, including cataract in the anterior eye (incidence rate, 0.18/eye-year) and epiretinal membrane in the posterior eye (incidence rate, 0.09/eye-year); incidence rates of reduction in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/50 or less and 20/200 or less were 0.10 and 0.06/eye-year, respectively. Rates of complications and visual acuity loss did not differ significantly between HIV- positive and negative individuals. In an era of re-emergence, syphilis has ocular complications that may compromise vision, despite treatment with appropriate anti-microbial drugs.\"\n\nOcular syphilis can involve any structure of the eye, but posterior uveitis is the most common, as was found in the above study from Brazil. Other manifestations may include anterior uveitis, optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis, and interstitial keratitis. Permanent blindness may result.\n\nOcular syphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis, including primary and secondary syphilis. In 2016, the US CDC noted that ocular syphilis occurred mainly in men who have sex with men (MSM) who were co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus from reports in 2 major cities, San Francisco and Seattle, and subsequent case finding (HIV); only \"a few cases\" at the time were noted in HIV-uninfected persons including heterosexual men and women (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm), which prompted speculation that an increased risk of central nervous system penetration by _Treponema pallidum_ in these HIV-infected patients or infection with a neuropathogenic strain of syphilis accounted for these findings. However, the above report from public medical centers in Brazil over a 2.5-year period ending July 2015 found 65% of patients with ocular syphilis were HIV-negative.\n\nIt is important to note that ocular syphilis should be managed according to treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm). - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBrazil: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6]\nSee Also\nSyphilis - USA: (NC) increased incidence, ocular, HIV-coinfection 20170330.4935408\n2016\n----\nSyphilis - USA (08): (NM) ocular 20160828.4446416\nSyphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520\n2015\n----\nSyphilis - USA (04): (WA, CA) ocular, MSM 20150318.3239070\n2007\n----\nSyphilis, ocular - Australia (NSW, VIC) 20070515.1547\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5966512", "archive_id": "5966512", "date": "2018-08-15 12:14:19", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - Viet Nam: (PT) contaminated medical equipment susp", "main_text": "HIV - VIET NAM: (PHU THO) CONTAMINATED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SUSPECTED\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 14 Aug 2018 03:20 pm GMT+7\nSource: VnExpress International [edited]\nhttps://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-investigates-abnormal-hiv-outbreak-in-northern-province-3792107.html\n\n\nHealth authorities in the northern province of Phu Tho, a 2-hour drive northeast of Hanoi, are investigating an HIV outbreak which they suspect is connected to unlicensed examinations offered by a private clinic.\n\nHealth officials last month [July 2018] took blood samples from 500 residents in the remote commune to carry out a quick HIV test after 2 people died of HIV/AIDS disease and 4 new HIV cases were spotted in the commune between February and June [2018]. The blood test results found 42 villagers infected with the HIV virus, but the source of infection is yet to be identified.\n\nAmong the HIV-infected people in Kim Thuong Commune was an 18-month-old baby girl whose family cannot understand how it happened.\n\nThe provincial health department is investigating the outbreak, and it could take several months to come to a final conclusion, some local reports say. However, local residents suspect that a local nurse had used the same needle for injecting several patients, and this could have caused the HIV outbreak. Initial investigation has found most of the infected people used to go to an unlicensed clinic he ran at home to get injections. He was not a doctor and had opened the clinic without permission. However, the man has denied that he is responsible for the outbreak. He has admitted that he opened a home clinic without permission, but has insisted that he did not use one needle for several patients.\n\nUnder the Penal Code, those who intentionally spread HIV to other persons can be sentenced to between 3 and 10 years in jail. The offender can face life imprisonment if the victim is a child.\n\nAs of last year [2017], Viet Nam had recorded 208 371 HIV-positive people and 83 000 AIDS patients. According to the Health Ministry, around 91 000 HIV-linked deaths have been reported so far.\n\nCurrently, only about 40-50 percent of HIV-positive people have health insurance, according to the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Phu Tho, located in northern Viet Nam, is said to be one of Viet Nam's poorest provinces, with a population of over 1.3 million residents; its capital Viet Tri is about 80 km (50 mi) northwest of Hanoi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph\u00fa_Th\u1ecd_Province).\n\nThe news report above suspects that the HIV outbreak in this northern Vietnamese community was caused by an unlicensed person who injected people using the same non-sterilized injection equipment. HIV genotyping would help establish if this is a common source outbreak.\n\nReusing equipment for injection without adequate sterilization for multiple patients can lead to transmission of several bloodborne pathogens, the most common examples being HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The risk of transmission is greatest for HBV and least for HIV (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/bbp/Exp_to_Blood.pdf).\n\nHIV prevalence in Viet Nam among adults (15-49 years of age) is 0.4 percent, with an estimated 11 000 new HIV infections and 7800 AIDS-related deaths in 2016; injecting drug use is the main mode of HIV transmission in Viet Nam, but men who have sex with men and female sex workers and their sexual partners are also at increased risk; and people living with HIV are said to mainly live in large cities and the mountainous provinces (http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/vietnam). - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Viet Nam: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2659]\nSee Also\nHIV - India: (UP) wandering medical practitioner, shared needle, alert 20180207.5613139\n2017\n----\nHIV - UK: (England) nosocomial\nrisk, alert 20170504.5010812\nHIV - China: (ZJ) nosocomial transmission 20170210.4830673\n2016\n----\nHIV: USA (CO) nosocomial, India transfusion related 20160603.4264066\nHIV - Europe: laboratory infection 20160225.4050454\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234\n2015\n----\nHIV - Cambodia: (BA) contaminated medical equipment susp.

But so effective was the drug that HIV infection rates in the study region declined anyway, the researchers concluded.\n\nDuring the rapid distribution of a drug that prevents infection -- a strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP -- among gay and bisexual men in Australia, researchers found that unprotected sex increased even among those not on PrEP, suggesting that perceptions of risk had declined in communities where the drug was widely available.\n\n\"Safe sex is basically transformed by PrEP,\" said Martin Holt, a researcher at University of New South Wales in Sydney, who led the study. \"It's great that these guys are feeling optimistic about avoiding HIV, but it has disrupted prevention methods at a community level.\"\n\nThe daily pill is highly effective in combating HIV infection and is recommended for at-risk populations, such as gay men and intravenous drug users, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe cross-sectional survey included almost 17 000 men in Victoria and New South Wales who said they had recently had casual sex with a male partner. From 2013 to 2017, the proportion of HIV-negative men using PrEP increased to 24 percent from 2 percent. During that time, the proportion of respondents with casual partners who said they consistently used condoms dropped to 31 percent from 46 percent.\n\nStrikingly, unprotected sex among men who did not take PrEP increased 9 percent.\n\n\"Rightly or wrongly, there is a sense among people that men can have safer sex without condoms for the first time,\" said Mitchell Warren, the executive director of AVAC [AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition], which promotes HIV prevention worldwide. \"We need a nuanced conversation about the patterns of choices.\"\n\nOne concern is that PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections. As use of the pill spreads, some clinicians are detecting more cases of diseases such as gonorrhea, as well as drug resistance to them, according to Dr Paul Volberding, the director of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. It is not clear whether the higher case counts are a result of decreased condom use or merely better surveillance.\n\n\"Does this mean that pushing PrEP is a bad thing? Of course not. It is preventing HIV, which is what it was designed to do,\" Dr Volberding said. \"But the challenges posed are no minor issue, and we need to take them seriously.\"\n\nDr Holt said he was uncertain how decreased condom usage will affect rates of HIV infection in the long term, but that so-called herd immunity -- the protective effects of a growing population of men who use PrEP and do not transmit HIV -- could at least partially counterbalance the effects of unsafe behaviors.\n\nInfection rates declined despite a rise in unprotected sex, suggesting widespread use of the drug may mitigate the effects of riskier behavior.\n\n[Byline: Emily Baumgaertner]\n\n[A version of this article appeared in the New York Times on 11 Jun 2018. - Mod.ML]\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been rapidly rolled out in large, publicly funded implementation projects in Victoria [Vic] and New South Wales [NSW], Australia. Using behavioural surveillance of gay and bisexual men, we analysed the uptake and effect of PrEP, particularly on condom use by gay and bisexual men not using PrEP.\n\n\"Methods. We collected data from the Melbourne and Sydney Gay Community Periodic Surveys (GCPS), cross-sectional surveys of adult gay and bisexual men in Melbourne, VIC, and Sydney, NSW. Recruitment occurred at gay venues or events and online. Eligible participants were 18 years or older (face-to-face recruitment) or 16 years or older (online recruitment), identified as male (including transgender participants who identified as male); and having had sex with a man in the past 5 years or identified as gay or bisexual, or both. Using multivariate logistic regression, we assessed trends in condom use, condomless anal intercourse with casual partners (CAIC), and PrEP use by gay and bisexual men, controlling for sample variation over time.\n\n\"Findings. Between Jan 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, 27\u2008011 participants completed questionnaires in the Melbourne (n=13\u2008051) and Sydney (n=13\u2008960) GCPS. 16\u2008827 reported sex with casual male partners in the 6 months before survey and were included in these analyses. In 2013, 26 (1 percent) of 2692 men reported CAIC and were HIV-negative and using PrEP, compared with 167 (5 percent) of 3660 men in 2016 and 652 (16 percent) of 4018 men in 2017 (p less than 0.0001). Consistent condom use was reported by 1360 (46 percent) of 2692 men in 2013, 1523 (42 percent) of 3660 men in 2016, and 1229 (31 percent) of 4018 men in 2017 (p less than 0.0001). In 2013, 800 (30 percent) of 2692 men who were HIV-negative or untested and not on PrEP reported CAIC, compared with 1118 (31 percent) of 3660 men in 2016, and 1166 (29 percent) of 4018 in 2017 (non-significant trend).\n\n\"Interpretation. A rapid increase in PrEP use by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney was accompanied by an equally rapid decrease in consistent condom use. Other jurisdictions should consider the potential for community-level increases in CAIC when modelling the introduction of PrEP and in monitoring its effect.\"\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of anti-HIV drugs, usually with Truvada (a combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine) daily, in people who are HIV-negative to prevent HIV infection as a consequence of risky sexual activity. When used as directed, PrEP has been shown to be highly effective at reducing the risk of contracting HIV infection. PrEP is supposed to be used with other risk reduction strategies such as condoms because people taking PrEP are still at some risk of contracting HIV and other types of sexually transmitted infection.\n\nThe study in Victoria and New South Wales Australia cited in the news report found HIV infection rates declined despite a rise in unprotected, condomless sex in MSM, likely a consequence of increasing rates of PrEP use in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM). The study also found that condomless sex increased among MSM who did not take PrEP. Although not reported in the Australian study, marked increases in rates of other sexually transmitted infections, specifically gonorrhea and syphilis, in MSM have accompanied increasing rates of condomless sex in these men worldwide, which in part has been attributed to increased testing for these diseases.

Previous reports have indicated that HPgV-2 (also known as HHpgV-1) is a transfusion-transmitted virus and is associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (1-5). The distribution and prevalence of HPgV-2 infection worldwide are of great importance but remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of HPgV-2 in the southern province of Guangdong and southwestern province of Sichuan in China. We have also identified HCV-infected persons, in particular HCV/HIV-1 co-infected persons who inject drugs (PWID), as populations at high risk for HPgV-2 infection. In addition, our work reveals the difference in the prevalence, distribution, and phylogeny between the first human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly GB virus C or hepatitis G virus) (6,7) and HPgV-2.\n\nThe Study\n--------------\nIn our initial investigation of HPgV-2, we screened a total of 367 delinked serum or plasma samples from high-risk groups for infection with HCV and HIV-1 and 500 healthy volunteer blood donors from Guangdong Province, China, by using ELISA (2,5), and a nested reverse transcription PCR targeting both the 5\u2032 untranslated region and nonstructural protein 3 regions of HPgV-2 (3,5). We observed a low frequency (0.4 percent) of HPgV-2 antibody detection and the absence of HPgV-2 viremia in healthy blood donors tested in our study. Out of 86 HCV-infected patients, 1 (1.2 percent) was positive for both HPgV-2 antibodies and viral RNA (Table 1 [for Tables and Figures, see original URL - Mod. LL]). Furthermore, we did not detect HPgV-2 RNA in men who have sex with men (MSM), although 1 (0.5 percent) of the 211 MSM was weakly positive for HPgV-2 antibodies and negative for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1; Figure 1).\n\nWe observed a relatively high prevalence of HPgV-2 infection in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID in the Guangdong Province; 12.9 percent (9/70) were positive for HPgV-2 antibodies and 5.7 percent (4/70) for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1). We obtained similar results from 270 PWID from Sichuan Province; 15.9 percent (43/270) were positive for HPgV-2 antibodies and 3.0 percent (8/270) for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1). Using Fisher exact test, we observed a statistically significant difference between HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients in prevalence of having HPgV-2 antibodies (6.2 percent vs. 0; p under 0.001) and prevalence of having HPgV-2 RNA (5 percent vs. 0; p equal to 0.026). Similarly, we observed a statistically significant difference between HIV-1-positive/HCV-positive patients and HIV-1-positive/HCV-negative patients in prevalence of having HPgV-2 antibodies (10 percent vs. 0; p under 0.001) and prevalence of having HPgV-2 RNA (4 percent vs. 0; p equal to 0.040) (Table 2). These findings indicate a close association between HPgV-2 and HCV infection and synergy between HIV-1 and HCV infection with respect to HPgV-2 infections (5).\n\nFurthermore, we obtained 6 near full-length genome sequences of HPgV-2 by using next-generation sequencing or sequencing of PCR products (5). These strains from China, which included 2 from PWID (IDU31 and SC-LS-01), 2 from HCV-infected patients (HCV-121 and C346), and 2 from HCV-infected blood donors (HCV1241 and HCV1563), exhibited an identity of 93.6-97.8 percent at the whole-genome level. Compared with other HPgV-2 strains from the USA and UK, the nucleotide sequence identity was 93.7-96.2 percent. Sequence divergence was greatest at synonymous sites, with ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions of 0.125-0.150, which are consistent with other reports (1-3). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HPgV-2 strains from China, USA, and UK clustered together to form a separate branch and fell into group 1 with the closely related pegiviruses from bats and rodents (Figure 2). Other pegiviruses from human, simian, and equine sources formed group 2, in which the variants of HPgV fell into a separate clade. These results illustrate the difference between the 2 human pegiviruses (1,2,8) and the low level of genetic diversity of HPgV-2 strains (1-3).\n\nIn contrast to the data on HPgV-2 infection, we observed a high frequency of HPgV infection across all 3 populations tested (HCV-infected patients, PWID, and MSM) (Tables 1, 2). The percentage of HPgV viremia was 14.0 percent (14/86) in HCV-infected patients, 19.0 percent (40/211) in MSM, and 40.0 percent (28/70) in PWID (Table 1). Among MSM, prevalence of HPgV RNA was 28.0 percent (28/100) in those who were infected with HIV-1 alone and 33.3 percent (4/12) in those who were HIV-1/HCV co-infected (Table 1). For MSMs who were negative for both HIV-1 and HCV, 7.9 percent (7/89) were positive for HPgV RNA (Table 1).\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nWe report the detection of the 2nd human pegivirus, HPgV-2, in HCV-infected (in particular HCV/HIV-1 co-infected) persons in Guangdong and Sichuan Provinces, China (Table 1). Our results and those from previous studies demonstrate that the virus occurs in several geographically distinct regions in the world (1-4,9,10).\n\nHPgV and HPgV-2 are the only known human pegiviruses (8), and comparing their association with HCV and HIV-1 infection is of great interest. Consistent with previous reports, we found that the prevalence of HPgV viremia was 7.9 percent in HCV and HIV-1-negative MSM and 33.3-40 percent in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected MSM and PWID (Table 1). In contrast, only 0.5 percent of MSM and 0.4 percent of healthy blood donors were positive for HPgV-2 antibodies, but all were negative for HPgV-2 RNA (Table 1). These results indicate that HPgV-2 infection might be much less frequent than HPgV infection, possibly because of its low transmissibility or high clearance rate (2-4). The dramatic difference of distribution and prevalence between HPgV and HPgV-2 infections in different populations provides a clue for investigation of disease association with HPgV-2. HPgV does not cause human diseases (11) and can inhibit HIV-1 replication as well as prolong survival of HIV-1-infected and Ebola virus-infected patients (12-14). However, possible pathogenicity and disease association of HPgV-2 remain to be elucidated.\n\nThe high-risk population susceptible to HPgV-2 infection includes HCV-infected patients and, in particular, HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID. Most (93.3 percent) of HPgV-2 infected patients were also co-infected with HCV (1-4). Notably, the relatively high frequency of HPgV-2 RNA detection was observed in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID in the Guangdong (5.7 percent) and Sichuan (3.0 percent) Provinces of China (Table 1) and in the USA (10.9 percent) (9). In contrast, a somewhat lower percentage (1.7 percent) of HCV-positive PWID in the United Kingdom were reported to be HPgV-2 RNA positive, whereas none of the 30 HIV-1 singly infected and 36 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected PWID were positive for HPgV-2 RNA (3). These discordant results warrant more studies in different countries to address the association between HPgV-2 and HCV/HIV-1 co-infection.\n\nOur findings are subject to 2 limitations. 1st, because a limited number of samples from only 2 provinces of China were tested, the results might not represent overall prevalence of HPgV-2 infection throughout all of China. 2nd, this study was a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal study, and, therefore, the proportion of persistent infection and natural history of HPgV-2 infection remain to be determined.\n\nFuture studies should address several questions: whether the close association between HPgV-2 and HCV infection represents a biologic dependence of these 2 viruses; how HCV/HIV-1 co-infection facilitates HPgV-2 infection; and whether HCV or HIV-1 viral proteins enhance the transmissibility or infectivity of HPgV-2. In addition, because the rarity of HPgV-2 detection in MSM could be a result of the low frequency of HCV or HIV-1 infection or the transmission route of HPgV-2, further research should aim to determine if is HPgV-2 more like a transfusion-transmitted virus rather than a sexually transmitted virus.\n\nReferences\n---------\n1.

To date, there have been 20 confirmed cases and 2 probable cases of infectious syphilis reported in 2018. By comparison, annual case counts were 20, 20, and 21 for 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.\n\nMost (80 percent) of the cases in 2018 occurred in Anchorage; 90 percent were in males; and ages ranged from 20\u00ad63 years, with 80 percent of the cases over 30 years of age. Of the males, 80 percent reported having sex with other males (MSM). Some patients have reported finding sex partners through phone apps (e.g., Grindr and Craigslist). Of the 20 confirmed syphilis patients, 5 (or 25 percent) were co-infected with HIV, 15 were White, 3 were Alaska Native people, and 2 were Black. The 2 female patients are of childbearing age.\n\nAlaska's uptick is part of a national trend of increasing rates for syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016 STD Surveillance Report indicates that there was a 17.6 percent increase in reported primary and secondary syphilis rates nationally from 2015 to 2016; the highest rate reported (8.7 cases per 100 000 population) since 1993. In 2016, Alaska ranked 50th in the nation for syphilis case rate. The CDC Report notes that MSM account for the majority of reported syphilis cases in 2016. The Report also notes that syphilis continues to be characterized by a high rate of HIV co-infection, particularly among MSM.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With 20 cases of syphilis reported in the past 2.5 months, 80 percent from the city of Anchorage, suggest that this may be another example of what the CDC has recently characterized as a \"rapidly growing cluster\" (RGC), but in this case of syphilis, not HIV infections. The CDC and co-workers reported 60 RGC of HIV infections in 20 states in all regions of the country. RGC had 5-42 persons during a 12-month period and HIV transmission rates ranging from 21-132 transmission events (median of 44) per 100 person-years compared with the national average of four transmission events per 100 person-years. The 903 persons in RGC were disproportionately young men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young Hispanic/Latino MSM infected by similar HIV strains on the basis of molecular sequencing (http://www.croiconference.org/sites/default/files/uploads/40.pdf).\n\nPerhaps this syphilis cluster investigation could similarly be aided by molecular typing of _Treponema pallidum_ infecting these patients. The Anchorage cluster may have been facilitated by use of smartphone geolocation apps such as Grindr.\n\nAnchorage, a city with an estimated 301 826 residents in 2017, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Alaska, located in the south-central portion of Alaska (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska).

However, the referenced news report does not give the numerical data supplied in the submission above:\n\n\"The Journal Sentinel first reported last week[*] that there was a social network of at least 125 people -- including a few high school students -- that had been identified, many of whom had contracted HIV, syphilis or both in one of the largest STI clusters ever discovered in Milwaukee. As many as 3 local babies were also born with syphilis last year.\n\n\"Those facing the greatest risk from the cluster include men who have sex with men (MSM); minorities; those who inject drugs; and human trafficking victims. 'Some of our most vulnerable communities are the communities that are affected by this,' Common Council President Ashanti Hamilton said. He and other city leaders urged people to use protection, get tested, know their status and communicate with their sexual partners. They also urged people to fight the stigma around the issue. 'Much of this is about the intersection of racism and homophobia that continue to be pervasive in our community,' said Kofi Short of Diverse & Resilient.\"\n\n*This prior Journal Sentinel Online article\n(https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2018/03/06/hiv-syphilis-clusters-affecting-least-125-people-including-high-school-students-discovered-milwaukee/397534002) also did not give the numerical data supplied in the submission above.\n\nWe now learn that of the 127 individuals in Milwaukee social network, 57 (45 percent) were HIV positive; 76 of the 101 tested were positive for HIV and/or syphilis. The cluster is said to involve men who have sex with men; minorities; those who inject drugs; and human trafficking victims, but numerical data is missing. Also missing is data on the genetic relatedness of the HIV strains causing the Milwaukee outbreak, as well as race/ethnicity or use of cell phone apps, such as Grindr, \"party drugs\", PrEP, etc. Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts.

The 'cluster' is being treated as a citywide health issue particularly among people between the aged of 15 and 24 [see ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (02): (WI) cluster, mostly young men, HIV, congenital 20180310.5678019].\n\nDr Frank DiCenzo, an OB-GYN in Pittsburgh, claims that the increase is a result of teens being more promiscuous in recent years. 'I've seen high school students who tell me they've had multiple sexual partners,' DiCenco told KDKA. 'Ladies as young as 14. And they have what they call sex partners. Someone that is a friend that they have sex with.' Additionally, Dr DiCenzo said he thinks they are less likely to be using protection. However, available data does not support either of those conclusions.\n\nThe most recent national data indicates that rates of sexual activity among adolescents and young adults have not changed in the last 2 decades, but there has been an increase in contraceptive use. In 2015, 30 percent of teens indicated that they were sexually active, meaning they had had sex at least once in the preceding 3 months, and 41 percent had had sex at least once in their lifetime. The number of teens who reported having had 4 or more sexual partners was 11.5 percent between 2011 and 2015, down from 19 percent in 2002. Data from 2011-2015 shows that 81 percent of female teens used some type of contraception when they first had intercourse, up from 74 percent in 2002. Similarly, 77 percent of male teens used a condom during first intercourse, up from 71 percent in 2002.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2014, the number of HIV cases in the US declined 18 percent. However, national rates for gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia have increased in each of the last 3 years on record -- 2014, 2015, and 2016.\n\nExperts say a decrease in funding for STD programs may be behind the increase in rates. According to the CDC, more than half of state and local programs experienced budget cuts. 'One big challenge is cuts to STD control programs that means public health is constantly being asked to do a bigger job with diminishing resources,' Fred Wyand, director of communications at the American Sexual Health Association told Daily Mail Online. 'This a discussion with much nuance and not a single, simple answer but public health advocates consistently report to an eroding STD [sexually transmitted diseases] prevention infrastructure as a key element in driving STD rates.'\n\nIn February [2018], Pennsylvania's Allegheny county opened a clinic that exclusively treats STDs and HIV in response to the increasing rates. Health officials in the area warn that anyone who is sexually active get tested because often symptoms take weeks or months to appear or never present at all.\n\n[Byline: Megan Sheets]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail recently posted a report on the Milwaukee outbreak of syphilis and HIV (Syphilis - USA (02): (WI) cluster, mostly young men, HIV, congenital 20180310.5678019). I commented in the moderator comments that the Milwaukee outbreak may represent what the CDC has recently defined as a \"rapidly growing cluster\" (RGC) of people infected by genetically similar HIV strains (http://www.croiconference.org/sites/default/files/uploads/40.pdf). The CDC and co-workers reported 60 RGC in 20 states in all regions of the country. RGC had 5-42 persons during a 12-month period and HIV transmission rates ranging from 21-132 transmission events (median of 44) per 100 person-years compared with the national average of 4 transmission events per 100 person-years. The 903 persons in RGC were disproportionately young men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young Hispanic/Latino MSM.\n\nThe Beaver county, Pennsylvania outbreak may be another example of a RGC, in this case involving HIV and gonorrhea among 15- to 24-year-olds. However, the news report above did not characterize the infected individuals as to race/ethnicity, sexual behavior, or use of cell phone apps, such as Grindr, \"party drugs\", PrEP, etc. Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts. Also missing is data on the genetic relatedness of the HIV strains causing the Beaver county outbreak. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.\n\nBeaver county, with a population of 170 539 residents in 2010, is in the US state of Pennsylvania and is immediately northwest of Allegheny county, whose county seat is the city of Pittsburgh, the second largest city in Pennsylvania, with a metropolitan population of about 2.3 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania).

The number of cases is expected to grow as more people come forward and clinicians identify more potential cases through asking those infected for their sexual history.\n\nAmong the cluster are as many as a dozen high school students, according to Milwaukee's Journal Sentinel. Officials have said this is an ongoing, city-wide health issue especially among people between the ages of 15 and 24 that will have serious consequences if it doesn't get under control soon.\n\nIn 2017, 3 babies were born with syphilis and health officials became increasingly concerned with the growing prevalence of STIs in mid-December [2017] after several people reported having HIV or syphilis symptoms.\n\nOn [Wed 7 Mar 2018] it was reported that 125 people, the majority of whom are men, have tested positive for one or both of the diseases, with 45 percent testing positive for HIV [56 of the 125 people]. Officials say the actual number of people in the cluster is likely higher than the 125 reported because many people don't come forward out of fear of being stigmatized.\n\nThe group has been identified as a 'cluster' because they could all be connected and were in contact with each other during a 12-month period, local public health consultant Melissa Ugland told the Journal Sentinel. Fewer than 10 percent, or about 12 people, are Milwaukee Public School [MPS] students.\n\n'We are working with the health department to provide preventative information to our students as they fall within this age group and we have the unique ability to literally reach hundreds of students at one time with information that can protect their health,' MPS spokeswoman Denise Callaway told Daily Mail Online.\n\nAfter a person tests positive for an infection, they are referred for care and interviewed about their sexual history. Officials then reach out to others who may have been infected so they can be tested and treated. Reports say that while some people in the cluster have been cooperative, others have been hesitant to reveal names of previous sexual partners.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 80 000 reported diagnoses of syphilis in 2016. The disease is most prevalent in men who have sex with men, but the number of cases affecting heterosexual men and women has increased in recent years.\n\nIn 2015 there were an estimated 39 513 new diagnoses of HIV in the US, a 10-percent decline from 2010. HIV is spread through bodily fluids such as blood and semen. Most HIV infections can be detected 4 weeks after contact and are diagnosed using a blood test. HIV rates vary from state to state, and 45 percent people with HIV are living in the South. Georgia has the highest rate with 31.8 people per 100 000 living with HIV. By comparison, Wisconsin has a rate of 4.6 per 100 000 people.\n\n[Byline: Megan Sheets]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of syphilis since 2000. In 2000 and 2001, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis reached historic lows with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, in 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the US, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.\n\nDuring 2000-2016, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-16), P&S syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. During 2015-2016, the rate of reported P&S syphilis increased 14.7 per cent among men and 35.7 per cent among women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/Syphilis.htm), and in 2016, the number of congenital syphilis cases was the highest it's been since 1998 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm).\n\nThe increasing incidence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections can be attributed to a change in sexual behavior away from safer sexual practices of the 1980s and '90s during the midst of the AIDS epidemic. As evolving medical therapy has changed HIV infection into a more manageable chronic disease, people have become complacent and stopped using condoms.\n\nOther factors include use of geolocating apps on smartphones that facilitate multiple anonymous hook ups for casual sex such as Grindr, Internet chat rooms, pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive \"party drugs\", and lack of education about the necessity of safer sexual practices.\n\n56 of the 125 people in the Milwaukee outbreak were HIV positive. This Milwaukee outbreak may represent what the CDC has recently defined as a \"rapidly growing cluster\" (RGC) infected by similar HIV strains on the basis of molecular sequencing (http://www.croiconference.org/sites/default/files/uploads/40.pdf). The CDC and co-workers reported 60 RGC in 20 states in all regions of the country. RGC had 5-42 persons during a 12-month period and HIV transmission rates ranging from 21-132 transmission events (median of 44) per 100 person-years compared with the national average of four transmission events per 100 person-years. The 903 persons in RGC were disproportionately young men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young Hispanic/Latino MSM.\n\nWe are not told in the news report above the specifics of this outbreak in Milwaukee: for example, are the people involved disproportionately MSM or of a particular race or ethnicity? Have they used cell phone apps, such as Grindr, \"party drugs\", PrEP, etc.? Knowing this type of information may help pinpoint prevention efforts.

All of those who tested positive said they had been treated by the same unqualified medical practitioner.\n\nPolice officers in the Unnao area are now looking for a jhola chhaap doctor in his mid-40s who rides a bicycle, often sits on a platform in the middle of villages and offers dubious cures. If arrested, police officials said, he is likely to face charges including spreading dangerous disease, impersonating a doctor and practicing medicine without a license.\n\nAccording to medical officials, he told many of his patients that an injection would make them feel better, and the patients said he kept reusing the same syringe without cleaning it.\n\nGovernment health officials are offering free HIV treatment to all the people who were infected.\n\nMohan Rao, the head of the Center of Social Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said the prevalence of jhola chhaap doctors was a result of India's overburdened medical system.\n\n\"Desperate people find desperate ways to get health care,'' he said. \"It's a failure of Indian society, a failure of Indian politics. We spend the lowest on public health care in the world.''\n\nIndia's government spent 1.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product on health care in 2014, according to the World Bank. China, by contrast, spent 3.1 percent of its GDP on health care that year, and the United States 8.3 percent.\n\nThe government said this month [February 2018] that it would offer free health care to half a billion poor Indians, but many details of the plan have yet to be finalized.\n\nA lengthy page on an Indian consumer complaints website describes dozens of encounters with jhola chhaap doctors across India, with bilked patients denouncing \"bogus\" practitioners who \"play with innocent people's lives.\"\n\nThe Delhi Medical Council, a government oversight body, estimates that fake doctors in Delhi outnumber the qualified and registered ones.\n\n[Byline: Jeffrey Gettleman, Hari Kumar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Whether these infections with HIV happened through ignorance of how the virus is spread or greed, laws need to be strengthened to prevent this from happening again. Further, the country needs to make accessible to a greater proportion of the public, education in infectious diseases, chronic disease, medical care, and nursing.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Healthcare Federation of India says the country has a shortfall of nearly 2 million doctors and 4 million nurses. It is most prominent in rural swathes where it is estimated that more than 60 percent of primary care visits made by villagers are to fee-charging unqualified practitioners.\n\nThe free primary health centres, (which may be several kilometres away in remote areas), are understaffed and open for just a few hours a week.\n\nOne controversial approach to correct this situation is to train unqualified practitioners in primary medical care. A non-governmental organization (NGO) that is doing this is Liver Foundation, a Kolkata-based charity. Across India, there are an estimated 1 million \"fake\" doctors, thus there are more fake doctors than real ones. Training them in basic principles of medicine may be a good approach to prevent situations like the one reported here.\n- Mod.LK\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55279]\nSee Also\n2017\n----\nHIV - UK: (England) nosocomial risk, alert 20170504.5010812\nHIV - China: (ZJ) nosocomial transmission 20170210.4830673\n2016\n----\nHIV: USA (CO) nosocomial, India transfusion related 20160603.4264066\nHIV - Europe: laboratory infection 20160225.4050454\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234\n2012\n----\nHIV - Kyrgyzstan: nosocomial transmission, children 20120211.1039333\n.................................................lk/mj/dk", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5434001", "archive_id": "5434001", "date": "2017-11-09 12:27:54", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Gonococcal dis., chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, Hep C - Australia (02): background", "main_text": "GONOCOCCAL DISEASE, CHLAMYDIA, SYPHILIS, HIV, HEPATITIS C - AUSTRALIA (02): BACKGROUND\n**************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 9 Nov 2017\nSource: GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network) [edited]\n\n\nRe: ProMED-mail Gonococcal dis., chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, Hep C - Australia: annual report 2016 20171107.5429168\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRates of gonorrhea and genital chlamydia infection in Australia have been increasing for several years (1,2).

Australian health experts highlighted the alarming rise -- from 62 to 101 infections per 100 000 people -- and the need for people to be more aware of the infection as the reasons behind the trend are not yet fully understood. There were more than 23 800 new cases of gonorrhea diagnosed in 2016, and about 75 percent of them were among men, according to the Annual Surveillance Report on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia, published [Mon 30 Oct 2017].\n\nIn males, rates of gonorrhea infection were highest in 20- to 29-year-olds last year [2016], while in women they were highest in 15- to 24-year-olds. But older age groups also saw increased numbers. Infection rates also rose significantly in major cities, which saw a 99 percent increase between 2012 and 2016, while remote areas saw a decline, the report shows. For example, among women, there was a 126 percent increase in major cities compared with a 43 percent rise among all Australian women.\n\n\"The increase was most pronounced in the past 2 years,\" said Rebecca Guy, program head with the Surveillance Evaluation and Research Program in The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society at the University of New South Wales, who compiled the report. The reason behind the rise is not fully understood, Guy said. \"What we do know is that more testing doesn't explain this trend,\" she said, adding that factors such as changes in sexual behavior, differences in screening and treatment practices, or differences in a particular strain in urban centers could be possible explanations. \"The data really highlight the need for greater awareness among clinicians, young people and adults about gonorrhea,\" said Guy, stressing that the condition is largely asymptomatic: 80 percent of women and 50 percent of men won't have symptoms. \"Therefore, regular testing is important.\"\n\nIn the United States, rates of gonorrhea infection have also been rising since 2009, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and are higher than rates in Australia, though the rise in recent years has been more modest. \"Australia is seeing some of the same trends of increasing (sexually transmitted disease) rates that we are in the United States,\" said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, who was not involved in the report. \"There are many factors at play here, but we have to acknowledge that as HIV becomes a more treatable and medically preventable disease, and condom use may be decreasing for some, we must continue to ensure that STD testing and treatment is prioritized, particularly in populations at increased risk for all STDs.\"\n\n\"Left untreated, gonorrhea is associated with serious long-term adverse health effects, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility,\" said Matthew Chico, assistant professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in response to the findings. \"Particularly concerning is that we are rapidly facing the day when gonorrhea is no longer treatable due to antimicrobial resistance,\" he said.\n\nThe infections seen in Australia had reduced susceptibility to drugs, meaning they are moving toward resistance, Guy said. But she doesn't believe this is causing the rise in infections.\n\nChlamydia infections also remained high in Australia, with more than 71 000 diagnosed in 2016, 75 percent of them among 15- to 29-year-olds, the report states.\n\nSyphilis infection rates more than doubled over the past 5 years, increasing 107 percent. However, numbers are much lower than with the other infections, with more than 3360 infections in 2016. Again, the greater number of infections was among men, particularly gay and bisexual men, Guy said. She added that this rise is related to an increase in people getting tested for the infection.\n\nBut the report found some progress in terms of sexual health. HIV infections remained stable in the overall population between 2012 and 2016, with just over 1000 new diagnoses in 2016. \"We're seeing increased uptake of HIV testing, particularly among gay and bisexual men, who are the population most affected by HIV in Australia,\" Guy said. However, Chico highlighted that gonorrhea can increase the spread of HIV by aiding its transmission. \"HIV has remained stable over the last 5 years,\" he said. \"However, gonorrhea facilitates the transmission of HIV. Thus, the rise in gonorrhea in Australia may contribute to new HIV cases in the near-term.\"\n\nGonorrhea rates fell among the Australian indigenous populations between 2012 and 2016, by 17 percent, but experts highlighted the fact that the numbers themselves remain disproportionately high: 6.9 times higher than non-indigenous populations in 2016, the report states. \"Gonorrhea has been a significant issue in the population for a very long period of time,\" said James Ward, head of the Infectious Diseases Research Program-Aboriginal Health at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute. \"We've got quite a bit of work to do.\"\n\nHIV infection rates rose by 33 percent among aboriginal and Torres Strait populations -- indigenous to Australia -- with infection rates about twice those of non-indigenous populations. Routes of infections, such as through injection drug use or heterosexual transmission, were also more wide-ranging among indigenous populations. Ward believes less uptake of treatment and services plays an important role.\n\n\"There's a real divergence occurring,\" he said, highlighting the different profile in terms of how infections are occurring. There are large efforts among men who have sex with men in terms of prevention efforts in Australia, he said, which account for 74 percent of infections among non-indigenous populations. \"We've got a long way to go,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Meera Senthilingam]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above news report references the \"Annual Surveillance Report on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs in Australia 2017\".

The report provides a comprehensive analysis of HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia and includes estimates of incidence and prevalence of HIV and viral hepatitis, by demographic and risk groups, patterns of treatment for HIV and viral hepatitis infection, and behavioural risk factors for HIV and hepatitis C infection.\n\n\"Key findings:\n- \"The number of new HIV diagnoses in Australia has remained stable over the past 5 years, with 1066 diagnoses in 2012, 1030 in 2013, 1084 in 2014, 1027 in 2015, and 1013 in 2016.\n- Of the estimated 227 306 people living with chronic hepatitis C at the start of 2016, 32 550 (14 percent) received hepatitis C treatment during 2016 and 30 434 (93 percent of those treated) were cured during 2016.\n- The number of newly diagnosed hepatitis B cases has halved in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the past 5 years. Newly diagnosed cases in the non-Indigenous population remained stable.\n- Chlamydia was the most frequently notified sexually transmissible infection (STI) in Australia, with a total of 71 751 notifications in 2016. Three-quarters (75 percent) of these notifications were among people aged 15-29 years.\n- Between 2012 and 2016, gonorrhoea notification rates increased by 63 percent (62 to 101 per 100 000), with an increase in both males (72 percent) and females (43 percent). The gonorrhoea notification rate in 2016 was higher in males (146 per 100 000) than in females (56 per 100 000).\" - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186.]\nSee Also\nGonococcal dis. chlamydia, syphilis - Canada (02): increased cases, background 20171031.5416876\nGonococcal dis, chlamydia, syphilis - Canada: (ON) increase, MSM, RFI 20171031.5414788\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia: USA, Argentina 20170507.5019549\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis, chlamydia - USA (02): (CA) coll. stu., incr. rate, RFI 20170405.4949859\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis, chlamydia - USA: (OK) increased rates 20170111.4758411\n2016\n----\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (05): (WA) rates up 20161124.4652700\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis., HIV - Australia: (AC) increased incid & testing, 2015 20161119.4640115\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (04): (CA) 2015 CDC national report 20161027.4589422\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, HIV - Ireland: rising incidence, MSM 20161017.4564211\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia, HIV - USA: (CA) LA, MSM, condom use 20160930.4527847\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis, chlamydia - UK: (ENG) rising incidence, MSM, youth, 2015 20160706.4328717\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (03): (CA) incr. incidence, 2015 20160620.4298962\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (02): (IL) incr. incidence, 2015 20160613.4283744\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - Australia: (QL) incr. cases, MSM, condom use 20160517.4225967\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease - Canada: (AB) inc. cases, MSM, smartphone apps 20160507.4208142\nSyphilis & gonococcal dis. - Norway: incr. cases, MSM, heterosexuals, 2010-2015 20160502.4196049\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis. - Malawi: (LI) incr. cases, young, antibiot. shortage 20160415.4162324\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis., chlamydia - Canada: (BC,ON) inc. cases, MSM, HIV, RFI 20160212.4016426\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (MN) rising incidence, young, MSM, women 20160209.4005647\n.................................................sb/ml/ao/jh", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5010812", "archive_id": "5010812", "date": "2017-05-04 05:42:42", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - UK: (England) nosocomial risk, alert", "main_text": "HIV - UK: (ENGLAND) NOSOCOMIAL RISK, ALERT\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 2 May 2017\nSource: Telegraph [edited]\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/02/emergency-clinics-set-nhs-reveal-hiv-positive-doctor-operated/\n\n\n400 people have been offered HIV tests after it emerged that they had been operated on by a doctor infected with the virus. Emergency clinics are being set up, although doctors have said that the chances that any patients were infected are \"very low\". Health officials say the locum medic, who worked in orthopedic surgery and A&E, was employed at 3 NHS hospital trusts between June 2010 and February 2015.\n \nNottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital, has written to 223 patients recalling them for blood testing. The HIV-positive doctor also worked at Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, where 120 patients have been notified, as well as the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust, where 57 patients are potentially affected.\n\nDr Stephen Fowlie, medical director in Nottingham, said: \"Transmission of the virus between an infected health care worker and a patient with an open wound can only occur if health workers themselves have an injury with bleeding when they are delivering patient care. \"There is no evidence this happened to this doctor in any patient contact.\" He said patients attending the emergency clinics would be promised a 24-hour turn-around on their blood tests.\n\nThe Trust said the unnamed doctor's condition was not known during the time he worked there.\n\nDr David Levey, regional medical director for NHS England Midlands and East, said: \"We understand that this will be a worrying time for patients who are being invited for precautionary testing and their families. However, clinical evidence shows that the risk of infection is extremely low, and it is highly unlikely that any of the patients being contacted will have been infected with HIV.\"\n\nOfficials emphasised that HIV could not be passed on by day-to-day contact, and while HIV-positive staff can work on patients, there were strict conditions in place.\n\n[byline: Henry Bodkin]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Transmission of bloodborne viruses in the health care setting is a 2-way street, from healthcare worker to patient, or vice versa.\n\nIn general, the risk of HIV transmission is 10 times lower than that of hepatitis C, which in turn is 10 times lower than hepatitis B.

In the same time period, the infection rate in Arizona increased 35 per cent, Spencer's data shows. \"Right now there are some limitations in state law that put up barriers to young kids getting education -- comprehensive sex education in school,\" he said.\n\nSince 1991, state law has prohibited schools from teachings that promote \"a homosexual lifestyle\" or suggest that safe-sex methods are safe, or safer, for homosexual sex. A bill that would've changed that was voted down last year [2016] by state legislators.\n\n\"There's still a perception that talking honestly about HIV and HIV transmission somehow is a bad thing,\" he said. Spencer is also pushing for increased awareness of PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis], a once-a-day drug that greatly decreases the risk of HIV infection.\n\n[byline: John Genovese]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This upswing in HIV infection is implied to be primarily in the MSM (men who have sex with men) community and state laws seem to have thwarted education efforts in this regard. The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy has made overwhelmingly differences in the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection but requires, at this point, life-long therapy to control. Education regarding safe sex practices in both homosexual and heterosexual situations and the availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis therapy should directly affect this increase in cases. Infected bisexual males represent a reservoir to infect women as well.\n\nWhether life-long therapy will always be required continues to be investigated.\n\nOne approach, studied in a simian model uses monoclonal antibodies and a human trial is being organized: dual antibody treatment suppresses HIV-like virus in monkeys https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/dual-antibody-treatment-suppresses-hiv-virus-monkeys/:\n\n\"HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, attacks the body's immune system. This assault leaves people vulnerable to developing other infections and diseases. Although treatments can control HIV infection, HIV persists in the body for a lifetime.\n\n\"Researchers have isolated many human antibodies that neutralize multiple strains of HIV. Scientists have gained important insights into how these broadly neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus and why they're effective. However, designing a strategy that allows the human immune system to mount an effective attack against the virus remains a challenge.\n\n\"A team led by Dr Malcolm A Martin at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Dr Michel C Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University has been exploring therapeutic approaches using broadly neutralizing antibodies. Their latest study, in rhesus macaques, appeared online on 13 Mar 2017, in Nature (Nishimura Y, Gautam R, Chun TW, et al. Early antibody therapy can induce long-lasting immunity to SHIV. Nature. 2017. doi: 10.1038/nature21435. [Epub ahead of print]. PMID: 28289286; http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7646/full/nature21435.html).\n\n\"The researchers inoculated 13 monkeys with SHIV, an HIV-like virus that infects monkeys. 3 days afterward, when infection could first be confirmed, the scientists began intravenous infusions of 2 potent, broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies. The antibodies, called 3BNC117 and 10-1074, each bind to a different site on SHIV. The animals received 3 antibody infusions over a 2-week period. The infusions suppressed SHIV to levels near or below the limit of standard detection methods for as long as 6 months. The virus then rebounded in all but one animal. However, 5 to 22 months later, the immune systems of 6 monkeys regained control of the virus, and the virus remained undetectable for another 5 to 13 months. These monkeys had continuously maintained healthy levels of key immune cells after receiving the antibody infusions. 4 other monkeys that failed to regain complete control of the virus maintained extremely low levels of SHIV in their blood for 2-3 years after infection. Thus, 10 of the 13 monkeys gained lasting benefits from the neutralizing HIV antibodies.\n\n\"Immune cells called CD8+ T cells help destroy infected cells. To test whether these immune cells played a role in the extended control of SHIV, the scientists depleted CD8+ T cells in the 6 controller monkeys. Without these immune cells, SHIV levels in the monkeys' blood rose, showing that CD8+ T cells were responsible for controlling SHIV after the antibody infusions.\n\n\"What really surprised us was that we could control SHIV for 2 to 3 years without any anti-viral drugs by infusing the antibodies right after the animals became infected,\" Martin says.\n\n\"Studies are now under way to test whether receiving neutralizing antibodies 2 to 6 weeks after infection -- timing that more closely resembles how soon an HIV-infected person first seeks medical attention -- will still enable monkeys to control SHIV. Clinical trials testing the antibody combination in people are also underway. Researchers are now recruiting HIV-infected and uninfected adults.\"\n\nAnother approach involves the CRISPR [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats] system to extract the integrated HIV provirus from the genome of infected individuals (http://www.philly.com/philly/health/health-news/Temple-uses-gene-editing-to-eliminate-HIV-infection-in-mice.html):\n\n\"Temple University researchers on [Mon 1 May 2017] said they had used a gene-editing technique to snip out HIV DNA from the genetic code of mice, bolstering the hope that the infection can be cured.\n\n\"The work, done with University of Pittsburgh scientists and published in the journal Molecular Therapy, builds on several years of Temple experiments that initially showed the AIDS virus could be cut from cells in lab dishes. A permanent cure for HIV has been elusive because the virus can maintain a simmering reservoir of infection in certain cells. Antiviral drugs suppress replication so that only a tiny minority of immune cells have the infection, but if the drugs are stopped, the latent virus can break out and resume its destructive course.\n\n\"The new study is the 1st to demonstrate that HIV replication can be shut down and the virus eliminated from animal cells by using the gene editing technology, called CRISPR/Cas 9. It combines a synthetic \"guide RNA\" -- a genetic analogue of the search function in a word processor -- with an enzyme that acts like a molecular scissors.\n\n\"The study, co-led by Kamel Khalili, director of Temple's center for neurovirology, successfully used the gene editing strategy in 2 mouse models -- one representing a newly acquired infection, when the virus is actively replicating, the other representing chronic, or latent, infection. The next step would be to repeat the study in primates such as monkeys, because they more closely mimic human HIV infection, Khalili said in a news release.\n\n\"CRISPR technology is barely 6 years old and has not been used in humans. Last year [2016], a federal advisory panel approved a University of Pennsylvania proposal to use CRISPR to engineer immune cells to fight certain types of cancer, but the trial must still be approved by the FDA.\"\n\n[byline: Marie McCullough]\n\nOne of the group's papers is:\n\nChaoran Y, Zhang T, Qu X, et al.

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of excising the HIV-1 provirus in 3 different animal models using an all-in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver multiplex single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) plus _Staphylococcus aureus_ Cas9 (saCas9). The quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 vector outperformed the duplex vector in excising the integrated HIV-1 genome in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from HIV-1 Tg26 transgenic mice. Intravenously injected quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 excised HIV-1 proviral DNA and significantly reduced viral RNA expression in several organs/tissues of Tg26 mice. In EcoHIV acutely infected mice, intravenously injected quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 reduced systemic EcoHIV infection, as determined by live bioluminescence imaging. Additionally, this quadruplex vector induced efficient proviral excision, as determined by PCR genotyping in the liver, lungs, brain, and spleen. Finally, in humanized bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice with chronic HIV-1 infection, successful proviral excision was detected by PCR genotyping in the spleen, lungs, heart, colon, and brain after a single intravenous injection of quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8. In conclusion, in vivo excision of HIV-1 proviral DNA by sgRNAs/saCas9 in solid tissues/organs can be achieved via AAV delivery, a significant step toward human clinical trials.\"\n- Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/207.]\nSee Also\nSyphilis - USA: (NC) increased incidence, ocular, HIV-coinfection 20170330.4935408\nHIV - China: (ZJ) nosocomial transmission 20170210.4830673\n2016\n---\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis., HIV - Australia: (AC) increased incid & testing, 2015 20161119.4640115\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, HIV - Ireland: rising incidence, MSM 20161017.4564211\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia, HIV - USA: (CA) LA, MSM, condom use 20160930.4527847\nHIV: inaccuracy, viral load assay, RFI 20160713.4339758\nHIV: USA (CO) nosocomial, India transfusion related 20160603.4264066\nSyphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Czech Republic: incr., MSM, HIV coinfect., 2010-2015 20160320.4106603\nHIV - Europe: laboratory infection 20160225.4050454\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis., chlamydia - Canada: (BC,ON) inc. cases, MSM, HIV, RFI 20160212.4016426\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234\n.................................................ll/mj/sh", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4935408", "archive_id": "4935408", "date": "2017-03-30 11:39:20", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Syphilis - USA: (NC) increased incidence, ocular, HIV-coinfection", "main_text": "SYPHILIS - USA: (NORTH CAROLINA) INCREASED INCIDENCE, OCULAR, HIV-COINFECTION\n*****************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 28 Mar 2017\nSource: Contagion Live [edited]\nhttp://www.contagionlive.com/news/ocular-syphilis-may-suggest-hiv-coinfection\n\n\nThe number of patients with ocular syphilis (OS) is increasing, and OS may be more common in syphilis patients who have concurrent HIV than in those who don't, recent research from North Carolina suggests.\n\n\"Reports of primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis have increased in North Carolina in recent years. Between 2014 and 2015, early syphilis increased from 1137 cases to almost 1900 cases, representing a 64 percent increase in reported cases. We found ocular syphilis in all stages of syphilis,\" lead author Anna Barry Cope, PhD, MPH, said in her late-breaker presentation [22 Sep 2016] at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016 STD Prevention Conference in Atlanta, Georgia. \"Nearly half of all syphilis cases in North Carolina are co-infected with HIV. They were infected with HIV either prior to their syphilis diagnosis or within 30 days after,\" added Dr Cope, an epidemiologist at CDC in Atlanta.\n\n\"Clinicians need to look for ocular syphilis in their at-risk patients. Patients need to know whether they have ocular syphilis, and that if they have it, they need to get treated quickly to prevent complications, including possible blindness,\" Thomas Peterman, MD, MSc, chief of the Field Epidemiology Unit for the Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch of the Division of STD Prevention at CDC in Atlanta, who moderated the late-breaker session, told Contagion.\n\nDr Cope and her colleagues compared OS prevalence by HIV status and timing of HIV diagnosis among all syphilis patients in North Carolina. They reviewed all syphilis cases reported in the North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NC EDSS) in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe researchers identified potential ocular syphilis cases in NC EDSS and matched ocular and non-ocular syphilis cases with the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS) to obtain HIV diagnosis date. They grouped all syphilis cases with HIV co-infection into previously diagnosed (HIV diagnosed more than 30 days before syphilis diagnosis) and concurrently diagnosed (HIV diagnosed within 30 days before or after syphilis diagnosis) cases. Cases with HIV diagnosed more than 30 days after syphilis diagnosis were considered HIV-uninfected. Prevalence ratios were used to match OS prevalence with HIV status.\n\nOf 4232 confirmed syphilis cases, 63 (1.5 percent) had ocular syphilis; of these 63 cases, 35 (56 percent) were co-infected with HIV; and of the 35, the diagnosis was concurrent in 11 cases (31 percent).\n\nOf the 4169 confirmed syphilis cases without OS, 1659 (40 percent) were co-infected with HIV; of the 1659, the diagnosis was concurrent in 253 (15 percent).\n\nThe prevalence of ocular syphilis was almost twice as high among HIV-positive patients as among those who were HIV negative or HIV unknown (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.1). Of the 1694 HIV-infected syphilis cases, 264 were diagnosed with HIV at the same time as their syphilis diagnosis, and 4 percent of the 264 cases were classified as ocular syphilis cases (prevalence ratio 2.5; 1.2 to 5.0). Among syphilis patients with a previous HIV infection, those with OS were older than those without OS (median age 42 years vs 33 years; P value 0.008), and they had a lower CD4 cell count (median 384 cells vs 521 cells/mL; P value 0.03). The viral load was roughly equal between OS and non-OS patients (median 40 copies vs 20 copies/ml, P value 0.4).\n\nSyphilis patients concurrently diagnosed with HIV who had OS were also older than those without OS (median age 48 years versus 27 years; P value 0.0004) and had a lower CD4 cell count (260 cells vs 382 cells/mL; P value 0.04). Patients with OS had a higher viral load (median 65,780 copies versus 44,024 copies/ml, P value 0.08).\n\nIn March 2016, the CDC issued a clinical advisory to US clinicians urging them to be aware of ocular syphilis, screen for visual complaints in patients at risk for syphilis, and test all patients with syphilis for HIV if their status is unknown or has been negative. \"The associations we found between older age, lower CD4 counts, and the prevalence of ocular syphilis suggest that OS development may be affected by immune status,\" Dr Cope said in an interview. \"All syphilis patients, especially those with ocular syphilis, should be screened for HIV,\" she noted. Drs Cope and Peterman called for further related research.\n\n[Byline: Lorraine L Janeczko]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Ocular syphilis can involve any structure of the eye, but posterior uveitis and panuveitis are the most common. Other manifestations may include anterior uveitis, optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis, and interstitial keratitis. Permanent blindness may result.\n\nOcular syphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis, including primary and secondary syphilis. Ocular syphilis has been recently noted mainly in MSM who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm), which may reflect an increased risk of central nervous system penetration by _Treponema pallidum_ in these patients or infection with a neuropathogenic strain of syphilis. A few cases of ocular syphilis have occurred among HIV-uninfected persons including heterosexual men and women.\n\nIt is important to note that ocular syphilis should be managed according to treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm).\n\nA map of the USA showing North Carolina can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nSyphilis - USA (08): (NM) ocular 20160828.4446416\nSyphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520\n2015\n----\nSyphilis - USA (04): (WA, CA) ocular, MSM 20150318.3239070\n2007\n----\nSyphilis, ocular - Australia (NSW, VIC) 20070515.1547\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/jh", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4830673", "archive_id": "4830673", "date": "2017-02-10 16:49:55", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - China: (ZJ) nosocomial transmission", "main_text": "HIV - CHINA: (ZHEJIANG) NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION\n***********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 9 Feb 2017\nSource: BBC [edited]\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38920454\n\n\nA Chinese hospital has admitted accidentally infecting 5 people with HIV because a staff member reused medical equipment that should have been discarded. Officials said that a technician reused a tube used to treat an individual with HIV on other patients.\n\nProvincial authorities described it as a \"severe violation of procedure\". Five people had been fired at Hangzhou's Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, they said. Provincial health officials said they were informed of the situation on [Thu 26 Jan 2017].\n\nBut in a statement (in Chinese) they gave no information on how many other patients might have been exposed, what they were being treated for or when the infections occurred. Those affected would receive treatment and compensation, the brief statement said.\n\nA total of 2 decades ago low safety standards and insufficient regulation helped spread HIV/AIDS in China, and the news of the hospital incident sparked shock and criticism from social media users. \"A provincial-level hospital doesn't follow protocols, who can we trust as average citizens?!\", wrote one person on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. \"This case is exposed, but what about cases that we don't know? There must have been many more!\" wrote another.\n\nCases of HIV/AIDS rose sharply in China after a major scandal in Henan province in the 1990s, when farmers who sold their blood contracted HIV through poor safety practices. Donors' collected blood was pooled together and the lucrative plasma removed. The remaining blood, now cross-contaminated, was then injected back into the donors so they could donate again soon.\n\nFor years officials tried to cover up the problem and it is still not clear how many were infected. China said in 2001 that between 30 000 and 50 000 people had contracted HIV through the blood-selling scandal, but other officials have since suggested the figure was much higher. The scandal did help highlight the ways in which HIV could be passed, and rules surrounding blood donation and transfusions have since improved, but illegal practices remain.\n\nIn 2006, a group of 19 people sued a hospital in Heilongjiang over transfusions from which they contracted HIV.\n\nIn a recent report, China said it had 501 000 reported cases of HIV/AIDS by the end of 2014. It gave no estimate of unreported cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Healthcare associated transmission of HIV as well as hepatitis B and C generally are related to breakdown in infection control practices. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/352.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nHIV: USA (CO) nosocomial, India transfusion related 20160603.4264066\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234\n2012\n----\nHIV - Kyrgyzstan (02): nosocomial, children 20120214.1041628\nHIV - Kyrgyzstan: nosocomial transmission, children 20120211.1039333\n2011\n----\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA (02): (CA) 20110114.0162\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA: (CA) alert 20110112.0139\n2009\n----\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - Australia: (QL) alert, corr. 20091117.3973\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - Australia: (QL) alert 20091117.3967\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA: (FL) alert 20091007.3473\nHIV, nosocomial - Mexico: Mexico City, alert 20090811.2857\n.................................................ll/ec/dk", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4640115", "archive_id": "4640115", "date": "2016-11-19 11:24:52", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Syphilis, gonococcal dis., HIV - Australia: (AC) increased incid & testing, 2015", "main_text": "SYPHILIS, GONOCOCCAL DISEASE, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS - AUSTRALIA: (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) INCREASED INCIDENCE, INCREASED TESTING, 2015\n***************************************************************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 17 Nov 2016\nSource: WAtoday [edited]\nhttp://www.watoday.com.au/act-news/stis-on-rise-in-canberra-due-to-increased-testing-20161115-gsplhq.html\n\n\nA leading sexual health group says a focus on regular testing and destigmatisation is behind a steady increase in diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections in the ACT [Australian Capital Territory]. Notifications of HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhea all increased in the territory between 2006 and 2015.\n\nA particularly sharp increase was recorded for gonorrhea, rising from 8.1 instances per 100 000 people in 2006 to 32.6 per 100 000 by 2015. Syphilis notifications went up from 4.2 per 100 000 in 2006 to 11.8 per 100 000 in 2015.\n\nThe ACT was among 3 jurisdictions to record the highest rate of newly-acquired HIV infection in 2015, with 20 new cases. The authors of the HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report 2016 urged caution, however, warning figures were low and trends should be interpreted with caution.\n\nAmong those newly infected with HIV who had been having heterosexual sex, 42.9 percent of men and 50 percent of women recorded a late diagnosis. 18 percent of men having sex with men received a late diagnosis. AIDS Action Council of the ACT executive director Philippa Moss said an increase in testing explained the spike in figures. \"It is concerning but we have to look at the bigger picture and testing is part of the bigger picture,\" she said.\n\n\"Stigma and discrimination has a lot to do with this because if you're able to talk about things it's easier to get tested but if you suffer from stigma about the practice you're doing and having HIV you're more inclined to take risks. \"We've certainly been investing a lot of time and resources into promoting testing, whereas people can often go undiagnosed.\"\n\nIn the same report, it was shown hepatitis C and B were on the decrease in the ACT.\n\n[Byline: Emily Baker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For discussions on the effect of increased screening for syphilis, gonococcal disease, and HIV on the increased incidence of these diseases, please see my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts: Syphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (CA), 2015 CDC national report 20161027.4589422; Syphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369; and Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/290.]\nSee Also\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (CA), 2015 CDC national report 20161027.4589422\nSyphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369\nSyphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803\nSyphilis - Australia: (QL) fatal, congenital, indigenous 20160527.4248380\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - Australia: (QL) incr. cases, MSM, condom use 20160517.4225967\n2015\n----\nSyphilis - Australia (04): (QL) MSM, bisexual, indigenous, RFI 20151213.3856016\nSyphilis - Australia (03): (QL) MSM, indigenous 20151115.3792153\nSyphilis - Australia (02): (NT,WA) increase, indigenous, congenital, fatal 20151102.3760394\nSyphilis - Australia: (NT) increased incidence, indigenous people, RFI 20150713.3507530\nGonococcal disease - Australia (04): (VI) screening, NAAT, comment 20150409.3287865\nGonococcal disease - Australia (03): (VI) screening, NAAT, comment 20150408.3284108\nGonococcal disease - Australia (02): (VI) screening, NAAT, comment 20150408.3284083\nGonococcal disease - Australia: (VI) screening, NAAT 20150401.3270179\n2014\n----\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - Australia: MSM, decreasing condom use 20140920.2789253\nGonococcal disease - Australia: ceftriaxone resistance 20140826.2723627\nGonococcal disease - Australia: (NS) increased incidence 20140619.2552639\nSyphilis - Australia: (VI) increased incidence, MSM, HIV co-infection 20140327.2361445\n2012\n----\nHIV - Australia: (AC, NS, VI) increased incidence 20121018.1351130\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/dk", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4564211", "archive_id": "4564211", "date": "2016-10-17 10:21:07", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Syphilis, gonococcal disease, HIV - Ireland: rising incidence, MSM", "main_text": "SYPHILIS, GONOCOCCAL DISEASE, HIV - IRELAND: RISING INCIDENCE, MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN\n****************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 14 Oct 2016\nSource: Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) [edited]\nhttp://www.hpsc.ie/News/MainBody,15859,en.html\n\n\nLatest annual reports on HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and preliminary data for the 1st 6 months of this year [2016], published by the HSE [Health Service Executive] Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) show increases in notifications of HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhoea in Ireland, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) (1,2).\n\nWhile the number of cases of most STIs [sexually transmitted infections] remained relatively stable in 2015 compared to 2014, the multisectoral national group established early in 2016 to respond to these recent increases has expressed concern about a 50 percent increase in syphilis, and a 30 percent increase in HIV cases in 2015.\n\nAlthough some of the increase in HIV can be explained by a change in the notification procedures for HIV and an outbreak in people who inject drugs, these increases have largely been seen in men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM account for 4/5 of the syphilis cases, and more than half of the HIV cases.\n\nFor HIV, an increasing proportion of MSM born abroad, and particularly from Latin America, who were HIV positive before coming to Ireland, has contributed to this. There are also increases in the number of MSM from abroad who report acquiring HIV in Ireland.\n\nIn addition, although gonorrhoea numbers in 2015 were similar to 2014, latest data for 2016 show that gonorrhoea rates in men have risen by 63%. This has been seen only in men, suggesting that this increase is occurring mainly in MSM. In 2015, 55% of cases of gonorrhoea were in this group [MSM].\n\nA recent survey on sexual behaviours in MSM in Ireland (MISI 2015 [Internet Survey Ireland]) (3), reported that 25 percent of men have had condomless anal intercourse with more than one partner in the last year, posing a risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV and STIs. 37 percent of men had never been tested for HIV and 38 percent had never been tested for an STI.\n\nPromoting condom use and regular testing remain key to limiting the spread of HIV and STIs in men who have sex with men.\n\nThe Gay Health Network along with the HSE and other partners, including peer groups, are continuing to promote sexual health awareness, encourage testing and support safer sex among MSM through the http://www.man2man.ie programme. The Gay Men's Health Service is offering a new clinic in Dublin on Monday afternoons, on a pilot basis, to improve access to testing for MSM. Furthermore, in partnership with the Gay Health Network, outreach workers are being employed on a pilot basis to deliver peer support and interventions among the MSM community, in particular among Latin American MSM in Dublin.\n\nSafer sex using condoms is an effective way of preventing HIV and other STIs. Men who have sex with men and who have taken a sexual health risk are encouraged to get tested for HIV and STIs. Details of free HIV and STI testing services, condoms, support, and information are available at http://www.man2man.ie or from Gay Switchboard Ireland or <ask@ghn.ie>.\n\n[References:\n------------\n1.

But estimates vary state-to-state for syphilis [incidence] rates among MSM from 73.1 per 100 000 individuals in Alaska to 748.3 per 100 000 individuals in North Carolina -- with no real explanation as to why that state's rates are so high. California levels [at nearly 332.2 cases per 100 000] are well above the national average. [See the source URL for CDC data on the primary and secondary syphilis incidence rates among MSM by state and region of the U.S. for 2015.]\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reports that since 2010, the number of reported cases [of primary and secondary syphilis] has increased by 74 percent. [The number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis rose from 632 in 2010 to 1097 in 2014 -- http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf.]\n\nIn 2014 alone there was a dramatic surge of congenital syphilis (a severe, disabling and often life-threatening form of the disease) with 31 cases reported, an increase over previous years of more than 300 percent [http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf].\n\nAccording to the 2014 Annual HIV/STD Surveillance Report from the Los Angeles County Department of Health, LA county reported the highest rate of HIV infection in the nation at 1820 per 100 000. [The total number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in Los Angeles County in 2013 was 1820, not the rate, which was 18 per 100 000. The number of cases was highest among large urban US counties and independent cities in the U.S., but the HIV diagnosis rate in Los Angeles County in 2013 was actually similar to or lower than that of other large urban jurisdictions in the U.S. -- see Table 1.2 in http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf.] The county appears to have the nation's highest rate of new HIV infections [no], though that number declined very slightly in the past year. [The rate per 100 000 of newly diagnosed HIV fell from 22 in 2010 to 18 in 2013. The rate of HIV diagnoses in LA County had been decreasing since 2008 (see Figure 1.2, http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf]. LA County has the nation's highest number of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia infection [among large urban U.S. counties and independent cities in the U.S., but the rates actually similar to or lower than that of other large urban jurisdictions in the U.S.; see Table 1.2, http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf].\n\n\"These studies underscore the critical importance of syphilis screening and care for gay and bisexual men. Prompt diagnosis and complete antibiotic treatment is essential to cure syphilis infections, prevent long-term health complications and stop the spread of infection,\" said Rachel Wingard, a spokesperson for the CDC.\n\nLos Angeles headquartered AIDS Healthcare Foundation, led by Michael Weinstein, is among a handful of agencies nationwide to stress other STDs in its prevention messages, focusing on the risks of contracting gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia if you engage in sex without condoms in its prevention messages.\n\nTransmission of HIV has been the primary concern of AIDS activists and many advocacy organizations, leaving prevention of other sexually transmitted diseases to only casual attention.\n\nThe \"No Glove, No Love\" condom code -- a staple STD catchall -- has been supplanted, some would say, by the now widely touted PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), a pill that (if taken daily) blocks HIV and is often used without a condom, despite the CDC recommended protocol. PrEP, however, does nothing to prevent other STDs. [See prior ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803.]\n\nProponents of PrEP have argued passionately that such concerns do not outweigh the benefits of a reduction in HIV infection rates that might one day result in an end to AIDS as a crisis (at least a Western one). And while there is no evidence or suggestion of any kind that use of or promotion of PrEP has led to the problems highlighted by the new STD revelations from the CDC, it does raise concerns about safer-sex messaging. PrEP certainly has benefits if properly utilized, as outlined in this study by UCLA Raphael J Landovitz entitled \"PrEP Adherence Enhancement Guided [by iTAB and Drug Levels for Women]\" [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02584140].\n\n[Byline: Troy Masters]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of PrEP, see prior ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803.\n\nIf some of the increasing numbers of MSM also have unprotected sex with wives and girlfriends, there may be a spillover that could lead to a rising incidence of syphilis in women and congenital syphilis. Syphilis can be passed from mother to infant during pregnancy, causing congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis cases are attributable to a lack of prenatal care, because mother-to-infant transmission of syphilis can be prevented or mother-to-infant transmission that has already occurred can be treated with benzathine penicillin G when maternal syphilis is detected. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4259.]\nSee Also\nSyphilis - USA (10): MSM, increase syphilis screening 20160925.4514369\nSyphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803\nSyphilis - USA (08): (NM) ocular 20160828.4446416\nSyphilis - USA (07): (New York City) women, rising incidence 20160713.4342960\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (03): (CA) incr. incidence, 2015 20160620.4298962\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (02): (IL) incr. incidence, 2015 20160613.4283744\nSyphilis - Canada & USA: Bicillin shortage 20160503.4199492\nSyphilis - USA (06): (TX, AL) rising incidence 20160501.4195453\nSyphilis - USA (05): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160403.4136361\nSyphilis - USA (04): (NC) incr. incidence, ocular, MSM, HIV, anon. online dating 20160320.4107520\nSyphilis - USA (03): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160315.4094546\nSyphilis - USA (02): (ID) rising incidence, MSM, substance abuse, mobile apps 20160305.4070537\nSyphilis - USA: (NV) rising incidence, MSM 20160226.4052496\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (MN) rising incidence, young, MSM, women 20160209.4005647\n2015\n----\nSyphilis - USA (16): pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20151114.3791354\n.................................................sb/ml/je/dk", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4339758", "archive_id": "4339758", "date": "2016-07-13 10:01:27", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV: inaccuracy, viral load assay, RFI", "main_text": "HIV: INACCURACY, VIRAL LOAD ASSAY, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n**********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 5 Jul 2016\nFrom: Margaret C Croxson <kittyc@adhb.govt.nz> [edited]\n\n\nThe problem of falsely elevated HIV viral load results has been around for a number of years, but it appears there has been neither clear identification of the source of the problem nor quantification of the contamination. It occurred to us that simple counting of the cells which remained above the silicon plug could resolve this uncertainty.\n\nHIV viral load assay\n--------------------\nWarning regarding use of Becton Dickinson plasma preparation tubes (BD PPT tubes).\n\nBD Vacutainer Plasma Preparation Tube [PPT] is marketed as \"the industry standard, offering a one-step closed system for collection, plasma preparation, and transport of plasma while assuring sample integrity and reducing preanalytical errors. In addition, the BD PPT is the trusted product of choice for laboratorians concerned with biosafety and interested in high-quality plasma for molecular diagnostic testing. The BD PPT is IVD [in vitro diagnostic] and CE [European community] marked for Molecular Diagnostics.\"\n\nIncreasing automation enables the primary tube to be sampled robotically then assayed. In anticipation of this automation we commenced direct manual sampling of the PPT tube, which had variably been stored under recommended conditions for 1 to 2 days following the initial 1100 g x 20 minutes centrifugation. Previously the plasma had been aliquoted to storage tubes following the initial centrifugation step.\n\nThis change in sample handling, to direct sampling from the stored PPT vacutainer tube, resulted in a high proportion of falsely elevated plasma viral load results. Patients who were compliant and confidently expected to be below detectable HIV levels were now returning viral loads of greater than 3 logs.\n\nExtensive literature has commented on this problem with BD PPT tubes and various speculations have been offered as to the source of the falsely elevated viral load. Further search revealed that the silicon plugs in PPT tubes were known to fail to achieve complete separation of WBC's [white blood cells] and platelets, although the extent of the plasma contamination has apparently not been recorded. We therefore resuspended the WBC remaining in the plasma fraction above the silicon plug after initial centrifugation and counted the residual cells. Flow analysis revealed a contamination of 105 WBC per ml of plasma. Thus the contamination is not trivial and represents 8 percent of the total WBC count. This WBC load closely accounts for the 3 log provirus contamination of the plasma fraction.\n\nBD recommends re-centrifugation of the primary PPT tube immediately before sampling and subsequent experience confirms that this step will eliminate the problem.\n\nWe are concerned to ensure that all users of BD PPT tubes be aware of this WBC contamination. In particular, an appropriate pre-sampling centrifuge step should be built into robotic handling of primary PPT tubes.\n\n--\nMargaret C Croxson\n<kittyc@adhb.govt.nz>\n\n[It appears that the issues with PPT tubes have been noted previously by scientists in the field. 3 log 10 is a big difference and minimally, would trigger additional testing, such as drug resistance testing, and possibly an unnecessary treatment change. Since BD does recommend re-centrifugation of the primary PPT tube immediately before sampling, and that has been demonstrated to eliminate the problem, it is important that labs be made aware of the importance of adhering to this protocol.\n\nAny further information on this assay problem would be appreciated. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Czech Republic: incr., MSM, HIV coinfect., 2010-2015 20160320.4106603\nHIV - Europe: laboratory infection 2060225.4050454\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160224.4041874\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (CO) nosocomial risk, alert 20160205.3997234\n.................................................lk/mj/ml", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4264066", "archive_id": "4264066", "date": "2016-06-03 16:52:26", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV: USA (CO) nosocomial, India transfusion related", "main_text": "HIV: USA (COLORADO) NOSOCOMIAL, INDIA TRANSFUSION RELATED\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] HIV - USA (Colorado) hospital\n[2] HIV - India transfusions\n\n******\n[1] HIV - USA (Colorado) nosocomial\nDate: Thu 2 Jun 2016\nSource: UPI [edited]\nhttp://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/06/02/Indicted-medical-technician-tests-HIV-positive-thousands-of-hospital-patients-being-tested/6771464848387/\n\n\nIndicted medical technician tests HIV positive; thousands of patients being tested\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA former surgical tech charged with swapping syringes at a Denver [Colorado] hospital so he could steal liquid pain medication has tested positive for HIV, the U.S. Attorney's office said.\n\n[The former surgical technician], 28, was indicted in February [2016] for tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit.

It is important for India to initiate screening of the blood supply.\n\nDespite being home to the world's 3rd-largest population suffering from HIV/AIDS (with South Africa and Nigeria having more), the AIDS prevalence rate in India is lower than in many other countries. In 2014, India's AIDS prevalence rate stood at approximately 0.26 percent -- the 90th highest in the world. The spread of HIV in India is primarily restricted to the southern and north-eastern regions of the country and India has also been praised for its extensive anti-AIDS campaign. The USD 2.5 billion National AIDS Control Plan III was set up by India in 2007 and received support from UNAIDS. The main factors which have contributed to India's large HIV-infected population are extensive labor migration and low literacy levels in certain rural areas resulting in lack of awareness and gender disparity.

Men accounted for 90 percent of syphilis cases, officials said, and almost half of the men diagnosed with the infection in 2014 also had HIV.\n\n\"I think that sometimes people that are HIV positive do feel protected by those medications [anti-retroviral drugs?],\" Ledford said. \"That's one of the communications that we want to get out for the community that is HIV-positive: There are other STDs they need to be concerned about.\"\n\nSyphilis can be treated with antibiotics, but the infection causes blindness, damage to the brain and heart and even death if left untreated. \"To the public, we need them to understand that unprotected sex is putting you at pretty high risk,\" Ledford said. \"Knowing who your sexual partners are and what their health status is is also very important.\"\n\nSyphilis has been so rare for so long that many doctors haven't seen it before, she said, and some cases have been misdiagnosed. \"It wasn't a common thing they were seeing in the community, so sometimes they miss the symptoms,\" she said. \"What we are trying to do is increase our educational outreach to our physicians because that is something that, if the diagnosis is missed, it increases the transmission into the population.\"\n\nWake County Human Services has scheduled an educational session for health care providers next Tuesday at its office on Sunnybrook Road.

The highest numbers of cases were in some of the state's most populous counties: Cumberland, Durham, Guilford, Mecklenburg and Wake.\n\nThe majority of syphilis cases are reported in males. In calendar year 2014, men made up 90 percent of those diagnosed, and of these new cases, most were among men reporting sex with men. Those who are HIV-positive are at highest risk of contracting syphilis. In 2014, 48 percent of males diagnosed with syphilis were co-infected with HIV.\n\n\"When a sexually transmitted disease goes untreated, it will lead to other issues,\" said Evelyn Foust, head of the Communicable Disease Branch in the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Public Health. \"In the case of syphilis, we are seeing a rise in ocular syphilis, which may cause permanent loss of sight. We are urging individuals to be open with their healthcare provider about their sexual health and for providers to be diligent in proactively screening and educating their patients.\"\n\nIn February 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated a clinical advisory outlining a national increase in ocular syphilis, and diagnostic and treatment options. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, any patient who presents with classic features of syphilis, or who has had a recent sexual exposure to syphilis, should be treated [for neurosyphilis] without waiting for test results.\n\n\"Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of ocular syphilis have resulted in significant consequences for patients, including permanent visual impairment and blindness,\" said Victoria Mobley, M.D., HIV/STD medical director for the Communicable Disease Branch. \"Syphilis has not gone away, and it's still as important as ever to practice safe sex and get tested regularly, not only to intervene early, but to limit the exposure of syphilis, HIV and other STDs to future partners.\"\n\nPeople should be tested for all STDs if they have been sexually active with more than one partner or with a partner whose STD status is unknown. Syphilis and HIV tests are available at local health departments.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 1st phase of syphilis (also called primary syphilis) appears as a painless sore (also called a chancre) at the site of inoculation, usually on the genitals or mouth, which goes away even without treatment in 3-6 weeks. The next phase (secondary syphilis) begins as the chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre has disappeared, when a rash appears on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, as well as elsewhere on the body. Flat warts may be seen in moist areas of the skin (e.g., in the perianal area, under the breasts), in the mouth, throat, larynx, penis, vulva, or rectum. During this stage, there may be flu-like symptoms. Pain during urination and other urinary disturbances are characteristic of gonorrhea and _Chlamydia_ infection, not early syphilis.\n\nOcular syphilis can involve any structure of the eye, but posterior uveitis and panuveitis are the most common. Other manifestations may include anterior uveitis, optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis and interstitial keratitis. Permanent blindness may result. Ocular syphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis, including primary and secondary syphilis. Ocular syphilis has been recently noted mainly in MSM who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm), which may reflect an increased risk of central nervous system penetration by _Treponema pallidum_ in these patients or infection with a neuropathogenic strain of syphilis. A few cases of ocular syphilis have occurred among HIV-uninfected persons including heterosexual men and women. Ocular syphilis should be managed according to treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm).\n\nWake, Mecklenburg, Cumberland, Durham, and Guilford Counties are located in the US state of North Carolina and are homes to some of the largest cities in the state. Wake County, with a population of about one million residents, is located in the northeast central region of the state; its county seat is the city of Raleigh, which is also the state capital and the 2nd most populous city in the state, with a population of 439 896 in 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_County,_North_Carolina). Durham County is adjacent to Wake County and is included in the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area, with a population of about 1.75 million residents in 2010; the city of Durham, which is its county seat and the state's 4th most populous city, is home to Duke University and is one of the 3 hub cities of the Research Triangle Park, the 2 other hub cities being Raleigh and Chapel Hill (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_County,_North_Carolina). Mecklenburg, with a population of over one million residents, is the most populous county in North Carolina; its county seat is Charlotte, which is the state's most populous city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg_County,_North_Carolina).\nGuilford County, with a population of 488 406, is the 3rd most populous county in North Carolina; its county seat is Greensboro, the 3rd most populous city in the state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford_County,_North_Carolina). Cumberland County, with a population of 319 431, is the 5th-most populous county in North Carolina; its county seat is the city of Fayetteville, the 6th most populous city in North Carolina and the home of Fort Bragg, a major U.S. Army installation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_County,_North_Carolina).\n\nA map of North Carolina counties can be found at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/north-carolina.shtml.\n\nThe news report above says there has been a dramatic increase in syphilis cases in 2015 in Wake County; men accounted for 90% of syphilis cases, most being men who have sex with men (MSM), and almost 50% were co-infected with HIV. Many were said to meet anonymous sex partners via online dating services. The pattern of high and increasing rates of primary and secondary syphilis mainly in MSM is similar to that which is occurring in many other places in the US and elsewhere, and reflects an ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, in men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nThis increased syphilis incidence has been attributed to a variety of causes that promote unprotected sex among MSM, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive \"party drugs,\" multiple anonymous sex partners, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous \"hookups,\" etc. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/235.]\nSee Also\nSyphilis - USA (03): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20160315.4094546\nSyphilis - USA (02): (ID) rising incidence, MSM, substance abuse, mobile apps 20160305.4070537\nSyphilis - USA: (NV) rising incidence, MSM 20160226.4052496\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: (MN) rising incidence, young, MSM, women 20160209.4005647\n2015\n----\nSyphilis - USA (17): (KS) rising incidence, young, African-American men 20151202.3834867\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA: rising incidence, young, MSM 20151120.3807799\nSyphilis - USA (16): pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20151114.3791354\nSyphilis - USA (15): (IN) rising incidence, MSM 20151101.3758678\nSyphilis - USA (14): (NY) increased incidence, MSM, RFI 20151019.3726009\nSyphilis - USA (13): armed forces, rising incidence, men, HIV 20151002.3686530\nSyphilis - USA (12): (CA) MSM, women, RFI 20150903.3622699\nSyphilis - USA (11): (OH) increased cases, MSM, women, RFI 20150725.3535758\nSyphilis - USA (10): treatment, benzathine penicillin, comment 20150721.3524155\nSyphilis - USA (09): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20150715.3512635\nSyphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA: (RI) 2014 increase, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20150526.3385623\nSyphilis - USA (08): (PA) rising incidence, RFI 20150430.3332545\nSyphilis - USA (07): rising incidence, MSM, lack of condom use 20150417.3304654\nSyphilis - USA (06): (AK) rising incidence, MSM, smartphone apps, update 20150411.3290818\nSyphilis - USA (05): (NY) MSM 20150325.3252913\nSyphilis - USA (04): (WA, CA) ocular, MSM 20150318.3239070\nSyphilis - USA (03): (AZ) rising incidence, MSM, smartphone apps 20150308.3215175\nSyphilis - USA (02): (OH) MSM, rapid point-of-care test 20150125.3117107\nSyphilis - USA: rapid point-of-care test 20150112.3085761\n2007\n----\nSyphilis, ocular - Australia (NSW, VIC) 20070515.1547\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4106603", "archive_id": "4106603", "date": "2016-03-20 11:34:57", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Lymphogranuloma venereum - Czech Republic: incr., MSM, HIV coinfect., 2010-2015", "main_text": "LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM - CZECH REPUBLIC: INCREASE CASES, MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, HIV CO-INFECTION, 2010-2015\n*****************************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 17 Mar 2016\nSource: Eurosurveillance Volume 21, Issue 11, Article 3 [edited]\nhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21412\n\n\nSteady increase of lymphogranuloma venereum cases, Czech Republic, 2010 to 2015; Rob F, J\u016fzlov\u00e1 K, Krut\u00e1kov\u00e1 H, Z\u00e1kouck\u00e1 H, Va\u0148ousov\u00e1 D, Kru\u017eicov\u00e1 Z, Machala L, Vesel\u00fd D, Jilich D, Hercogov\u00e1 J.\n\nSince the notification of the 1st case of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in the Czech Republic in 2010, the numbers of LGV cases have steadily increased in the country. In 2015, 40 LGV cases were diagnosed, bringing the total for 2010-2015 to 88 cases. The profile of the most affected group, HIV-positive men who have sex with men with a previous sexually transmitted infection, matches that of those described in LGV outbreaks in Western Europe.\n\nIn this report we present data on 83 lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) cases from a total number of 88 LGV cases reported in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2015, with 40 cases reported in 2015 alone.\n\nBackground\n-----------\nLGV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the L1, L2 and L3 serovars of _Chlamydia trachomatis_ [1]. Since 2003, LGV has been endemic in western European men who have sex with men (MSM) [1]. Recently, the number of reported cases has been increasing in countries like the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands and Spain [2-5]. The 1st case who presented with typical clinical manifestations compatible with LGV in eastern and central Europe was detected in 2010 in the Czech Republic at the Dermatovenerology department, Na Bulovce Hospital, Prague, in cooperation with the associated AIDS-Centre and the National Reference Laboratory for _Chlamydia_ (NRL) in Prague [6]. Over the last five years, we have noticed an increasing number of patients with LGV in the Czech Republic. Additionally, four cases of LGV in HIV-positive Hungarian men were diagnosed between November 2012 and February 2014 in Hungary [7]. Data from other countries in eastern and central Europe are not publically available.\n\nDiscussion\n-------\nIn this report we provide data on LGV diagnoses from one reference centre to understand the trends and epidemiology of this infection in a country in eastern/central Europe. The characteristics of the patients in our centre are very similar to those in the Netherlands and the UK [3,9]. The diagnosis of LGV is predominantly in HIV-positive MSM with a previous history of STIs. Given that our centre is the referral centre for the whole country, patients from other parts of the Czech Republic and not only from Prague were diagnosed here. Thus, our data suggest that LGV infection is spreading in the Czech Republic. Only one report from Hungary published in 2015 described four cases of LGV [7]. The lack of data from eastern and central Europe contrasts sharply with the situation in Western Europe, where several outbreaks have been reported recently [2,4]. This may be due to lower awareness among clinicians in these countries, or less testing and reporting, or less transmission.\n\nThe increasing number of LGV cases in the Czech Republic is probably due to several interconnected reasons. LGV is an infection predominantly found in HIV-positive MSM. The number of HIV-positive patients in the Czech Republic has been steadily growing by 10-15% every year over the last two decades [10]. More than 80% of these newly diagnosed HIV patients in the Czech Republic are MSM. According to the anecdotal evidence, sexual tourism in the Czech HIV-positive MSM community is also quite widespread. Several patients with confirmed infections in our study reported having had sexual contacts with foreigners from Western Europe (Germany, Spain, UK) where LGV outbreaks have been described recently [1,2,4]. These imported infections may be further spreading in some subgroups of the local Czech MSM community with high-risk sexual behaviour. This conclusion is supported by the increasing number of gonococcal, non-LGV chlamydial and syphilis cases within this subgroup.\n\nLGV is mandatorily notifiable in the Czech Republic [11]. The very small number of cases notified by other departments may be explained by the low level of awareness among dermatovenerologists, proctologists and urologists in the region. This fact is reflected in the cases with rectal symptoms. These patients were not requested to disclose information about having had receptive anal sex or about having been tested for _C. trachomatis_ infection. Six patients with rectal LGV infection in our group were treated for IBD over the course of several months prior to the correct diagnosis. Four patients received immunosuppressive treatment (azathioprine, systemic corticosteroids), which aggravated their problems. It is therefore also necessary to educate gastroenterologists to check the patient's clinical history for receptive anal intercourse and to perform tests for _C. trachomatis_ in men with IBD symptoms [12].\n\nAnother problem is the very limited number of laboratories which are able to perform confirmatory tests. In the Czech Republic, this confirmatory test can only be performed by one laboratory (NRL). We are not aware of any other laboratory in the region that does routinely this form of testing.\n\nThe question also remains as to the level of awareness that exists in the other countries of the eastern and central European region because the patients with the LGV infection in our cohort also reported having had sexual contacts with individuals from other countries in the region (Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). It is therefore possible that there is a similar trend in these countries as well.\n\nNearly half of the patients in our group had another previously undiagnosed sexually transmitted co-infection at the time of the LGV diagnosis. This reinforces the need for testing for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C and also for gonococcal infections in these patients. In our study, 24 (28.4%) of the LGV infections were asymptomatic. These asymptomatic LGV cases were only diagnosed through NAATs screening of chlamydial infections in patients with newly diagnosed syphilis. Our department introduced this form of screening in 2009 because of the high number of asymptomatic gonococcal and chlamydial predominantly rectal infections. The percentage of asymptomatic infections in our group was almost identical to a recently published study from the UK [13]. Since nine patients had pharyngeal and urethral LGV, we recommend testing not only rectal samples, but also samples from the urethra and pharynx in high-risk patients. Asymptomatic or undiagnosed patients can quickly spread the infection within the MSM community because of frequent change of sexual partners and because having concurrent relationships are common in some parts of the MSM community [14,15]. The early diagnosis of symptomatic patients, tracing the sexual contacts of patients with confirmed LGV, and screening of asymptomatic high-risk patients (HIV-positive MSM with risky sexual behaviour) may help to control the spread of LGV. It is also necessary to educate patients about the risks of the disease, symptoms, protection, and points of contact in case of symptoms.\n\nThe main limitation of this report is that we are only presenting data from one centre; however, this is because we are the only centre that systematically focuses on LGV infections in our region. The number of reported asymptomatic LGV cases at our clinic may be higher compared to other centres due to the routine _C. trachomatis_ screening we carry out on patients with newly diagnosed syphilis. We are not able to report the proportion of LGV positive tests from all tests performed for _C. trachomatis_ because positive tests in heterosexual patients were not further tested for LGV.\n\nConclusion\n--------\nThe increasing number of patients with LGV in our department suggests that the LGV infection is already established and spreading in the Czech Republic and may be present in other countries in the region. Dermatologists, proctologists and gastroenterologists must be more aware of this condition, particularly in patients with rectal symptoms. To keep the situation under control, it is necessary to intensify testing and screening for chlamydial infections and LGV confirmation in eastern and central Europe.\n\n[The full report, including the references, is available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_ serovars L1, L2, or L3. In 2012 ProMED-mail posted a report of 4 cases of LGV proctitis in men who had sex with men (MSM) in 2010-2011 in the Czech Republic (ProMED-mail post Lymphogranuloma venereum - Europe: (Czech Republic, Spain) increase 20120116.1011622). All cases were HIV-infected MSM who used sex toys; 3 of them had had numerous sexual contacts.\n\nThe above report updates the data on LGV from the Czech Republic: a total number of 88 LGV cases were reported in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2015, with 40 cases reported in 2015 alone. Anecdotal evidence suggested to the investigators that sexual tourism in the Czech HIV-positive MSM community from Western Europe, where LGV outbreaks have been described recently, may explain the outbreak of LGV in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe diagnosis of LGV is suspected in patients with a compatible clinical presentation. Serology (complement fixation titers greater than 1:64 or microimmunofluorescence titers greater than 1:256) can support the diagnosis, but laboratory confirmation depends on detecting _C. trachomatis_- specific DNA, followed by genotyping to identify serovars L1, L2, or L3 to differentiate LGV from non-LGV _C. trachomatis_. However, this technology is not widely available, which the investigators suggest may explain the infrequent reports of this disease in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe. In addition, this clinic in the Czech Republic had a heightened level of clinical awareness for this disease and routinely performed nucleic acid amplification screening for _C. trachomatis_ in rectal, urethral and pharyngeal samples in asymptomatic high-risk patients. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/110.]\nSee Also\nLymphogranuloma venereum - UK: increased incidence, MSM, HIV-pos., 2003-2015 20151205.3842153\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Ireland: (Dublin) increased incidence, MSM, HIV-pos. 20150214.3166265\n2012\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Europe: (Czech Republic, Spain) increase 20120116.1011622\n2006\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Australia (NSW) 20060801.2134\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA 20060208.0410\n2005\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Switzerland: 2003-2005 20051227.3688\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Sweden (Stockholm) 20050719.2085\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Switzerland ex Germany (02) 20050715.2023\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Switzerland ex Germany 20050627.1816\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Europe (02) 20050602.1542\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Canada 20050601.1523\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Europe 20050404.0965\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476\nLymphogranuloma venereum - UK (England) 20050207.0416\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Spain (Catalonia): 2004 20050203.0375\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA (New York City) 20050203.0369\n2004\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA (TX 20041224.3397\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA (CA) 20041222.3376\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Netherlands 20040124.0278\n.................................................ml/msp/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4050454", "archive_id": "4050454", "date": "2016-02-25 17:28:33", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> HIV - Europe: laboratory infection", "main_text": "HIV - EUROPE: LABORATORY INFECTION\n**********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 24 Feb 2016\nSource: MedPage Today [edited]\nhttp://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/CROI/56370\n\n\nLab Mystery: How Did Worker Get HIV Infection?\n------------------------------------------------\n'Perfect storm of errors,' researchers speculate\n\nNote that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nItalian researchers are trying to unravel a frightening mystery: How did a European laboratory worker become infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a non-infectious strain?\n\n\"We are looking at a perfect storm of errors,\" Claudia Alteri, PhD, a researcher at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, told MedPage Today. \"We cannot exclude any mode of infection at this time.\"\n\nAt the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, she explained that her laboratory was asked to investigate the incident, which did not occur in Italy.\n\nThe infected laboratory worker -- whose identity, including sex and age, are being withheld -- only found out about the infection when the person was tested in the process of donating blood and was determined to have active HIV infection. The worker denied all the known risk factors: no sexual behavior consistent with HIV infection, monogamous sex partner was HIV-negative, no injection or IV drug use, and no history of blood transfusions or invasive medical procedures.\n\nAdding to the mystery, the laboratory worker also said that no laboratory accidents had occurred. The worker did not recall any broken gloves, cell medium splash, percutaneous injury such as a needle stick, or anything else that might have caused an exposure.\n\nYet, Alteri and her colleagues found, the genetic sequence of the HIV virus in the worker's body was almost identical to an HIV construct that the worker was using in experiments in the Biosafety Level 2 laboratory. That construct was not supposed to be infectious.\n\nThe investigators believe that somehow a competent HIV virus from a Biosafety-3 laboratory found its way into the lower-safety level laboratory. That in itself might not have caused the infection, but also present were experiments using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -- a highly infectious pathogen that is related to the rabies virus and is often used in laboratory experiments as an infection vector.\n\nThe laboratory worker was conducting pseudotyping procedures that required plasmid encoding for the G glycoprotein of VSV, Alteri said. VSV can increase virus infectivity 20- to 130-fold, she said.\n\nWhat happened next is speculation, the researchers said. They think that, somehow, the competent HIV virus was able to share its genes with the non-infective construct, rendering the construct infectious. And that, in turn, became attached to the VSV.\n\n\"VSV can infect any cell in the body,\" said molecular biologist John Coffin, PhD, of Tufts University in Boston. \"So it is possible that the virus infected the worker through direct contact or through the lungs if the virus was in an aerosol form,\" he told MedPage Today.\n\nWhat the researchers do know, Alteri reported in her oral presentation and at a press conference, is:\n\n\"HIV-1 contagion occurred in the period when the person was working on HIV-1 pseudoviruses production with defective constructs in a bio-safety 2 laboratory containment.\"\n\n\"All those procedures should not have included any infective vector.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, an infectious HIV-1, NL4.3/JRFL molecular clone, probably present in the laboratory at the time, entered the chain of HIV-1 pseudoviruses that the worker was handling, most likely causing the infection.\"\n\nWhat Alteri and her colleagues have not confirmed is when and how the infectious molecular clone entered the pseudoviruses production; what was the mode of contagion since no reported event that might explain what happened has ever been reported or recalled; and if the use of the VSV favored the contagion.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is the worker is now HIV-positive and is being treated with antiretroviral therapy, and will have to continue that treatment for life, assuming a definitive cure for the disease is not discovered.\n\n\"This is an interesting and disturbing case,\" Coffin said as he moderated the press conference, \"of an individual in an research laboratory who through a series of rather inadvertent accidents became infected with HIV.\"\n\nHe said the episode suggests that, in some laboratories, \"there has been a little bit too much familiarity with the use of HIV vectors, which can be very valuable in gene therapy. I think there has been a certain amount of biosafety fatigue in laboratories that needs to be revisited by institutional biosafety committees. These kinds of accidents just shouldn't happen.\"\n\nPrimary Source: Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections\n\nSource Reference: Alteri C, et al \"HIV -1 laboratory contagion during recombination procedures with defective constructs\" CROI 2016; Abstract 18LB, available at:\nhttp://www.croiconference.org/sessions/hiv-1-laboratory-contagion-during-recombination-procedures-defective-constructs\n\n[Byline: Ed Susman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen\nGermany\n<CVLonghorns@aol.com>\n\n[Without full disclosure of laboratory practices, it will be difficult to sort out what went wrong to allow a lab worker to become infected.

The person, 28, was indicted on charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit, federal officials announced Tuesday, 16 Feb 2016.\n\nThe indictment accuses the former employee of Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colorado, of tampering with a syringe containing pain medication there and knowingly acquiring the medication \"by deception and subterfuge.\" He did so, officials allege, \"with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk.\"\n\nEarlier in February 2016, Swedish Medical Center said a former employee could have exposed patients to hepatitis and HIV, but did not name the employee or detail how the patients could have been put at risk. The employee, officials said, could have stolen narcotic pain medication intended for patients. The hospital said about 2900 patients should get tested for the viruses, adding that it had no evidence of any patient exposure but wanted to be cautious.\n\nAccording to state regulators, the former employee allegedly removed a syringe containing the pain medication fentanyl from an anesthesia cart and replaced it with another labeled syringe \"in the beginning stages of a surgical procedure\" on 22 Jan 2016. Prosecutors say the replacement syringe contained another substance. The former employee's urine later tested positive for fentanyl, regulators said in an order suspending his license in January 2016.\n\nA lawyer says he is representing 14 people who are among the former surgery patients the hospital said should get tested. At least 2 have tested positive for hepatitis B, said the lawyer.\n\nHospital officials declined to comment. A spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment told CNN affiliate KMGH that officials are not releasing details about whether patients have tested positive for the viruses at this time. \"CDPHE is not releasing information about lab results, either positive or negative, related to the Swedish Medical Center ... at least until completion of our investigation -- likely weeks to months from now,\" spokesman Mark Salley said, according to KMGH.\n\nSince the Colorado hospital's announcement, 2 hospitals in Arizona where [the employee] once worked have also said they are offering free hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV testing to patients who had surgery while he worked there. HonorHealth John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Phoenix said it's offering testing to 97 patients and Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale said it would offer free testing to patients who underwent surgery there from 19 May 2014 to 2 Jul 2014. Both hospitals said they believe the risk is low that patients contracted the viruses, and that they are recommending testing out of an abundance of caution.\n\nIn 2009, a surgical technician at another Colorado hospital infected 19 patients with hepatitis C after she injected herself with syringes that held their pain medication, then replaced the pain medication in their syringes with saline. The technician pleaded guilty to a number of federal charges and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nCeleste Whitlow\n<whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>\n\n[If hepatitis B was transmitted by tainted syringes if would likely be related to the former surgery technician contaminating the syringes with his own blood.

There is a particular focus on urging gay men to get tested regularly. Vancouver Coastal Health says 97 percent of syphilis diagnoses are male and over 80 percent identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nVCH says it's seen a shift to younger men, with the largest increase in syphilis rates among 20 to 24-year-olds. It adds syphilis is being diagnosed both among men living with HIV and those who are not, pointing out having syphilis increases the risk of getting HIV infection. Dr. Reka Gustafson explains who is most at risk and prevention measures: On Sunday [14 Feb 2016], VCH, Positive Living BC, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), YouthCO and Health Initiative for Men (HIM) will launch a marketing campaign focusing on gay men.\n\nSyphilis is a contagious infection spread primarily by sexual activity. People with syphilis may not know they have it because they may not have symptoms. It can be cured with antibiotics. However, if syphilis is left untreated, it can lead to blindness, hearing loss, deep bone pain and neurological problems. Severe cases can be fatal.\n\nVCH and the BCCDC recommend that men who have sex with men get tested every 3 to 6 months, and visit their doctor if they have sores, bumps, a rash, blisters or warts on or around their genitals or anal area. They also recommend using condoms. Click here [http://smartsexresource.com/] to find a testing clinic.

That's a good thing, but then we're seeing more confirmed cases of STIs.\" Sexually active people with multiple partners could be a factor as well. \"Even though one person in a relationship may be monogamous, they may assume their partner is monogamous too but that may not always be the case, so people must communicate and talk to their partner,\" Kargiannakis said.\n\nAPH states there has been a 47 percent increase in confirmed cases of chlamydia in people 25 [years of age] and over in Algoma, though the largest number of confirmed cases of that infection is in the 15 to 24 age group. With gonorrhea, the largest increase is in the 15 to 24 age group, but also on the rise in people 25 and over. \"We really want to increase awareness of prevention, transmission, the fact that testing for these infections is easily available and it's free, and the fact that treatment for most STIs is easily available and free as well,\" Kargiannakis said.\n\n\"We want to empower our residents within the district to access testing ... we're hoping sexually active people will include testing for STIs as part of their health screening.\" Testing is available through APH (call 705-541-7100 or toll free at 1-800-726-0398) or your health care provider.\n\nIf left untreated, STIs in women can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), complications of which include long-term pelvic/abdominal pain and infertility. In men, untreated STIs can lead to pain in the tubes attached to the testicles and sterility. APH's advice is for each person to know his/her status (if they have or don't have an STI), their partner's status, use condoms and have routine testing done.\n\nAnother word of caution. It is becoming more difficult to treat certain STIs. \"With some of these infections, especially gonorrhea, we're seeing a lot of antibiotic-resistant strains across the province and that is a concern,\" Kargiannakis said, adding it is \"absolutely\" more important than ever to be careful. Most faith-based groups teach refraining from sex before traditional, opposite-sex marriage in order to avoid STIs and a host of other problems. Secular health authorities, including APH, advocate being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test results and to use condoms.\n\n[Byline: Darren Taylor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Vancouver Coastal Health serves 25 percent of British Columbia's population; that's over 1 million people including the residents of the Metropolitan Vancouver area, and communities along the Sea to Sky corridor (Squamish, Whistler, and Pemberton), and the Sunshine Coast (Gibsons, Sechelt, and Powell River, Bella Bella and Bella Coola) (http://www.vch.ca/en/).

Most cases are in men who have sex with men (MSM) living in London [England], with high rates of co-infection with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In light of these data, and the recent finding that one quarter of LGV infections may be asymptomatic, clinicians should be vigilant in testing for LGV, including in asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM.\n\nLaboratory diagnoses of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in the United Kingdom (UK) declined between 2010 and 2012, but the most recent data show near doubling of cases since 2012 to unprecedented levels in 2014 (679 cases). This trend has continued into 2015, with 683 cases diagnosed by 30 Sep [2015]. In 2014, most cases were in men who have sex with men (MSM) and around 3/4ths were HIV-positive. Here we report national surveillance data showing trends in LGV diagnoses in the UK from 2003 to September 2015.\n\nTesting protocol and data sources\n---------------------------------\nRectal, genital or urine samples from patients with symptoms compatible with LGV and diagnosed with _Chlamydia trachomatis_ in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and their sexual contacts with _C. trachomatis_, are submitted by local laboratories for LGV typing to the Public Health England national reference laboratory, the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit (STBRU) in London. Scottish samples from symptomatic patients are similarly submitted to the Scottish Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infections Reference Laboratory (SBSTIRL) in Edinburgh. In addition, since 2007, samples from asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM diagnosed with _C. trachomatis_ are also sent to SBSTIRL. During the reporting period, (January 2003 to September 2015) STBRU and SBSTIRL diagnoses accounted for all confirmed LGV cases diagnosed in the UK. Duplicates were excluded and repeat diagnoses within 42 days (used to define a single episode of care across surveillance systems in England) were counted as a single episode [1].\n\nAdditional data, including sexual behaviour and clinical information, were collected through nationally coordinated enhanced surveillance of LGV in the UK between 2004 and 2010 [2]. However, the most recent laboratory dataset lacks this enhanced information. We therefore matched laboratory reports for LGV diagnoses to the Genitourinary Medicine Clinic Activity Dataset (GUMCADv2), an anonymised patient-level electronic dataset, for all cases in England in 2014. All commissioned sexual health services in England have been mandated to return GUMCADv2 data, which include patient characteristics, other sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses and services provided, since 2009 [3]. A code for LGV diagnosis was introduced in 2011, such that most cases are now reported through GUMCADv2. LGV diagnoses in female or heterosexual male patients in GUMCADv2 were excluded from this analysis because they may represent miscoding (6 cases).\n\nTrends in confirmed laboratory reports\n--------------------------------------\nBetween 1 Jan 2003 and 30 Sep 2015, there were 4124 LGV diagnoses in the UK (36 from Scotland since 2011). Of these, 4,111 (99.7 percent) were in men, and 242 had repeat diagnoses. LGV was 1st reported in the UK in 2003 (one case) and in 2004, 28 cases were reported (Figure).\n\nSince 2003, the overall trend in LGV cases has been upward, with 3 rapid increases in 2005 (220 cases), 2010 (510 cases) and 2014 (679 cases), and intervening periods of stable or falling numbers between 2006 and 2009 (136 to 201 cases) and 2011 and 2012 (389 and 376 cases). There has been a sustained increase in diagnoses since 2012, such that diagnoses in 2014 were 81 percent higher than in 2012 (376 cases), and in the 1st quarter of 2015, there were 195 LGV diagnoses compared with 163 diagnoses in the same time period in 2014.\n\nCase characteristics among clinical reports\n-------------------------------------------\nIn 2014, 11 468 diagnoses of _C. trachomatis_ among MSM and 633 LGV cases were reported to GUMCADv2. Of the LGV cases, 434 (69 percent) could be matched to the laboratory dataset. Among the matched MSM cases, the median (IQR) age at LGV diagnosis was 37 (range: 31-44) years, and most were white (320, 74 percent), born in the UK (239, 55 percent) and living in London (323, 74 percent). Most cases were HIV-positive (321, 74 percent) and of these, nearly all were diagnosed with HIV before or at the same time as their LGV diagnosis (313, 98 percent). Many patients were diagnosed with another STI or blood borne virus infection at any time during 2014 (272, 63 percent), including gonorrhoea (219, 50 percent), syphilis (76, 18 percent) and hepatitis C (13, 3 percent) (Table).\n\nBackground\n----------\nLGV is a STI caused by the invasive L serovars of _C. trachomatis_. An outbreak among MSM was 1st reported in the Netherlands in 2003 and LGV outbreaks in MSM have since been reported by many high-income countries, with HIV co-infection being a common feature [4-8]. Most reported infections are rectal, and the most common presentation is proctitis, associated with rectal pain, discharge and bleeding [5,9]. Some cases of LGV, particularly in the beginning of the outbreak, were misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease [10,11]. The complications of incorrectly treated or untreated LGV are serious, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, including genital ulcers, fistulas, rectal strictures and genital elephantiasis. LGV acquisition is associated with concurrent STI infections and reported behaviours such as condomless anal intercourse, fisting and the use of sex toys [2].\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSince 2003, LGV diagnoses have increased over a 12-year period, with a steep rise since 2012, to reach unprecedented levels in 2015, suggesting high levels of ongoing transmission. Infection remains concentrated in white MSM living in London, many with HIV co-infection and other STIs.\n\nThe strength of this study lies in the unique national dataset of laboratory confirmed LGV diagnoses, which we linked to clinical data for the most recent complete year. During the study period, LGV testing was only recommended for symptomatic patients and LGV contacts. However, a large multicentre case-finding study in the UK found that 27 percent of LGV infections were detected in patients without rectal symptoms, suggesting that infections might be missed [12,13]. Patients might also be treated presumptively without LGV testing or never seek care, leading to further underestimation of LGV cases in the population. Other external factors might have influenced requests for LGV testing and the trends observed. These include the introduction of charging laboratories for LGV diagnostic testing (April 2014) and increased awareness of LGV among clinicians and microbiologists, which might have led to increased testing. We lack data on symptoms associated with LGV infection in this surveillance dataset.\n\nThe increase in LGV diagnoses coincides with upward trends in other STIs and sexually transmissible enteric infections among MSM, such as gonorrhoea, infectious syphilis, verotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ [14-17]. Contributory factors might include sexual networks with high rates of partner change facilitated by social media networking sites and chemsex, and we know that HIV-positive MSM who engage in HIV sero-adaptive behaviours and have condomless sex with other HIV-positive men remain at particularly high risk [15-17]. Our data suggest a need for a strengthened public health response to raise awareness of LGV among clinicians and patients. Social media might offer a means of rapid, low-cost dissemination of public health messages, with an additional benefit of facilitating user interaction [18].\n\nThere are also important implications for clinical management and microbiologists, including the need for robust partner notification, testing and treatment, and testing of HIV-positive MSM with asymptomatic _C. trachomatis_ infection for LGV [19]. LGV treatment requires an extended course of antibiotics over non-LGV _C. trachomatis_, such that some patients may unnecessarily receive multiple courses of antibiotics; this risks introducing selection pressure for antimicrobial resistance [20]. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for LGV in HIV-positive MSM with rectal symptoms, and consider treating presumptively for LGV according to national guidelines [21,22].\n\n[The Figure, Table and References are available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria that rely on host cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy production. Chlamydia have 2 forms: a non-replicating, infectious elementary body, analogous to a spore, and a replicating, non-infectious reticulate body. The elementary body induces its own endocytosis upon attachment to host cells, within which the elementary body converts to the replicating reticulate form. Up to several hundred progeny are produced within a large cytoplasmic inclusion. The reticulate body then reverts to the elementary form and is released by the cell through exocytosis. _Chlamydia trachomatis_ is transmitted through infected secretions, and infects mainly columnar epithelial cells, particularly in the cervix, rectum, urethra, throat, and conjunctiva.\n\nWithin the _C. trachomatis_ species, there are multiple serovars. The diseases caused by _C. trachomatis_ depend on the serovar: serovars A, B, Ba, and C cause trachoma; serovars D through K cause genital and perinatal infections; and serovars L1, L2, and L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).\n\nLGV is spread by anal, oral, or vaginal sex without a condom. Transmission may also occur through sharing sex toys. Symptoms can occur between 3 to 30 days after infection. Small painless papules or ulcers may appear at the site of infection and may go unnoticed if the ulcer is in a place that is not readily visible (e.g., in the rectum, vagina, urethra, or mouth). LGV spreads from the initial site of inoculation, such as, urethra, rectum, cervix, or throat, to the regional lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. Swelling and redness of the skin overlying the enlarged, tender regional lymph nodes, such as in the groin area, may occur, followed in some patients by suppurative lymphadenitis and drainage through the skin from the involved lymph nodes. Painful bowel movements and urge to defecate (tenesmus) accompanied by blood, mucus, or pus from the rectum (or in the stools) may occur, especially among those who practice receptive anal intercourse, and can mimic inflammatory bowel disease. Untreated, LGV can cause chronic drainage and scarring, chronic swelling of the genitals, strictures, and infertility.\n\nIt is likely that cases of LGV proctocolitis, for example, represent only a fraction of the cases that have actually occurred. Without use of laboratory assays that can differentiate LGV from non-LGV _C. trachomatis_, many LGV cases can be misdiagnosed as non-LGV chlamydial rectal infection and treated with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/proctitis.htm). The CDC recommends that at the time of the initial visit (before diagnostic tests for chlamydia are available), persons with a clinical syndrome consistent with LGV, including proctocolitis or genital ulcer disease with lymphadenopathy, should be presumptively treated for LGV (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/lgv.htm).\n\nCDC STD Treatment Guidelines for LGV recommend the use of doxycycline, twice a day for 21 days. Alternative treatments are erythromycin or azithromycin. The CDC notes that persons with both LGV and HIV infection should receive the same LGV treatment as those who are HIV-negative. Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has LGV within the 60 days before onset of the patient's symptoms should be examined and tested for urethral, cervical, or rectal chlamydial infection depending on anatomic site of exposure and treated presumptively for exposure (doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7 days or azythromycin 1 gm PO as a single dose) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/lgv.htm).\n\nA recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases, such as LGV, among HIV-infected MSM (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642). Some MSM who are HIV-negative may be taking pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, i.e., a pill containing a combination of 2 anti-HIV drugs, tenofovir and emtricitabine, to protect against HIV in a belief that they can avoid using a condom during high-risk sexual activity. These types of tactics may be at play in the LGV outbreaks. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/40.]\nSee Also\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Ireland: (Dublin) increased incidence, MSM, HIV-pos. 20150214.3166265\n2014\n----\nSyphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642\n2012\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Europe: (Czech Republic, Spain) increase 20120116.1011622\n2006\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Australia (NSW) 20060801.2134\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA 20060208.0410\n2005\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Switzerland: 2003-2005 20051227.3688\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Sweden (Stockholm) 20050719.2085\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Switzerland ex Germany (02) 20050715.2023\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Switzerland ex Germany 20050627.1816\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Europe (02) 20050602.1542\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Canada 20050601.1523\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Europe 20050404.0965\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476\nLymphogranuloma venereum - UK (England) 20050207.0416\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Spain (Catalonia): 2004 20050203.0375\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA (New York City) 20050203.0369\n2004\n----\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA (TX 20041224.3397\nLymphogranuloma venereum - USA (CA) 20041222.3376\nLymphogranuloma venereum - Netherlands 20040124.0278\n.................................................mpp/ml/je/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3686530", "archive_id": "3686530", "date": "2015-10-02 12:24:48", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Syphilis - USA (13): armed forces, rising incidence, men, HIV", "main_text": "SYPHILIS - USA (13): ARMED FORCES, RISING INCIDENCE, MEN, HIV\n*************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 30 Sep 2015\nSource: Newswise [edited]\nhttp://www.newswise.com/articles/msmr-analysis-reports-significant-increases-in-incident-rates-of-syphilis-among-u-s-service-members\n\n\nThe crude annual incidence rates for syphilis among United States service members rose 49.1 per cent over a health surveillance period from 2010 to 2014, according to a new analysis published in the September issue of the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC) [1].\n\nDuring the surveillance period of [1 Jan 2010] through [31 Aug 2015], a total of 2976 cases of syphilis were diagnosed. The annual incidence rates increased from 30.9 cases per 100 000 person-years (p-yrs) in 2010 to 46.1 cases per 100 000 p-yrs in 2014. In the 1st 8 months of 2015, the rate was 47.4, the highest level during the surveillance period, the report said.\n\n\"The increasing incidence of syphilis in military members is of significant public health concern because this finding suggests that some service members have been engaging in unsafe sexual practices that increase the likelihood of acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections (including HIV),\" according to the authors' conclusions.\n\nSyphilis is a highly contagious, systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Treponema pallidum_, and is transmitted primarily through sexual or other physically intimate contact; transmission requires direct contact with a syphilitic sore. In the US civilian population, rates of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis in males increased 91 per cent from 2005 to 2013.\n\nAmong all beneficiaries of the Military Health System, reported syphilis cases have increased since 2012. In July 2015, the number of reported syphilis cases in the preceding 12 months was higher than any similar 12 month period in the previous 5 years, according to the Department of Defense AFHSC Reportable Events Monthly Report.\n\nIn the new analysis, of the 2976 cases of syphilis diagnosed, 51 per cent (n=1523) were identified through a reportable medical event for syphilis, while another 45.6 per cent (n=1357) were identified via a diagnosis in an outpatient record. 60 cases (2.0 per cent) and 36 cases (1.2 per cent) were identified via records in the Theater Medical Data Store or by discharge diagnoses in inpatient records, respectively (Table 2).\n\n42 per cent (n=1253) of cases were specifically identified as primary or secondary syphilis; crude incidence rates of primary and secondary syphilis cases increased every year since 2011. Syphilis cases staged as latent accounted for an additional 27.1 per cent (n=809) of cases; cases where the stage was unspecified comprised another 670 (22.5 per cent) cases. Crude rates of latent and unspecified syphilis peaked during 2013 and 2014, respectively, while late syphilis rates in\n2015 were slightly lower than the rates in the 1st year of the surveillance period (Figure 1) (Table 2).\n\nMen contributed the greatest proportion of syphilis cases (88.7 per cent) during the period, and incidence rates for males increased every year of the surveillance period. Female rates of syphilis were highest in 2014 at 34.0 cases per 100 000 p-yrs (table 2 in the reference below).\n\nOverall, syphilis rates were highest in those service members aged 20-29 years; these age groups accounted for 61.6 per cent of the total number of cases ascertained. These age groups have also demonstrated consistent increases in incidence rates year after year during the surveillance period (table 2 in the reference below).\n\nThe overall incidence rate in black, non-Hispanic service members was twice that of Hispanics, who had the 2nd highest overall incidence rate of syphilis (table 2 in the reference below). Almost a quarter of syphilis cases (24.4 per cent; 727 cases) also were diagnosed as HIV seropositive; of these, 601 (20.2 per cent) were diagnosed [with HIV infection] before syphilis and the remainder (4.2 per cent) were diagnosed as HIV seropositive after syphilis diagnosis (table 3 in the reference below).\n\nAs the authors' conclusions noted, there have been multiple hypotheses for the resurgence of syphilis in the civilian population: among these are decreases in safer sex practices; increased use of the Internet as a means of meeting sexual partners; and the increase of harm reduction strategies such as oral sex, which can decrease the risk of HIV transmission but conversely increase the risk of contracting syphilis. Several of these sexual risk behaviors have been documented as being increased in Army service members who are HIV seroconverters.\n\n\"Developing and implementing syphilis prevention measures targeting service members at high risk of acquisition should continue to be promoted as well as continuation of aggressive sexual partner notification programs,\" the study's conclusions said.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Incidence rates of primary and secondary syphilis have increased in both groups in the past several years. Incidence rates in men are much greater in men than women. Men contributed an increasing proportion of cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the general US population, accounting for 91.1 per cent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases in 2013 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm). In 2013, for comparison, men aged 20-24 and 25-29 years had the highest incidence rates for primary and secondary syphilis in both the Armed Forces and general population; men aged 20-24 years and 25-29 years had incidence rates of 17.0 and 21.1, respectively, in the Armed Forces (Table 4a, reference 1) and 26.3 and 27.0, respectively, for the general US population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm). Corresponding incidence rates for primary and secondary syphilis in women in the Armed Forces in these age groups were 2.6 and 0.9, respectively in 2013 (Table 4b, reference 1).\n\nThe largest increases in recent years in cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the general population in the US are occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2012, primary and secondary syphilis cases in the 35 areas that reported the sex of sex partners, the proportion of male primary and secondary syphilis cases attributed to MSM increased from 77.0 per cent (6366) in 2009 to 83.9 per cent (8701) in 2012. Increases in incidence occurred among MSM of all ages and races/ethnicities from all regions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points out that these findings underscore the need for continued syphilis prevention measures specifically targeted to MSM.\n\nHowever, the article in Medical Surveillance Monthly Report (MSMR) does not mention sexual behavior among the men with syphilis in the Armed Forces (1). Nevertheless, a recent article points out that in soldiers newly-diagnosed with HIV in the US Armed Forces, a majority were male and commonly reported male-male sexual contact, civilian partners, online partner-seeking, and unprotected anal sex (2). The news article above reports that almost one-quarter of syphilis cases in the Armed Forces were HIV seropositive. Similar high rates of HIV and primary/secondary syphilis co-infection have been documented among MSM in the general population, ranging from 20 per cent to 70 per cent (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-msm-syphilis.htm).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

This 1st case of long-term remission gives scientists new insights into the potential effectiveness of early HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] detection and treatment. Researchers say early detection of HIV and treatment can, in some cases, limit infection.\n\nA French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment, raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for AIDs. The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an AIDS conference in Vancouver, Canada by doctors from the Institut Pasteur [Paris] who treated her. Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the 1st weeks of her life. Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a \"functional cure,\" because the child had no detectable virus. However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.\n\nThis time, there is more caution. It is the 1st case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent. The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for 6 weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load, and she was put on a cocktail of 3 antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV. When the girl was 6 years old, the family decided to stop the drugs, and for 6 months, doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable, although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.\n\nThere are people known as \"elite controllers\" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier Saez-Cirion of the HIV, Inflammation and Persistence Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the French woman does not have the genetic factors associated with those persons. \"Most likely, she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.\" That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection, and all except 2 still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.\n\nSaez-Cirion said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the 1st 6 months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the 2 remaining, one lasted for 3 years without needing drugs, and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.\n\n\"She is doing perfectly well,\" said Saez-Cirion. \"She has a healthy life with no complications.\" But he added: \"Very clearly, this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission.\" The case was presented at the 8th International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: \"We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure ... The child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About one percent of people can do that.\"\n\nLewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. It was possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.\n\n\"The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,\" she said. \"These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment.

Patients at Gentle Dentist and Dr Starkenburg's clinics may have been exposed to HIV and [viral] hepatitis.\n\nSix dentists have been suspended over hygiene breaches. The SiA DENTIST clinic has been suspended for potentially exposing thousands of people to HIV and viral hepatitis, and has admitted it was \"behind the times\" in hygiene standards. NSW Health has suspended 6 Sydney dentists and cautioned another 6 over poor sterilisation practices that may have exposed more than 11 000 dental patients to HIV and hepatitis during the past 10 years.\n\nDr Robert Starkenburg's practices in Surry Hills and Bondi, as well as The Gentle Dentist, owned by Dr Samson Chan, in Campsie and Sussex St, are believed to have potentially exposed some patients to serious diseases -- including hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV -- due to poorly cleaned equipment.\n\nDr Robert Starkenburg -- who practices in Bondi Junction and Surry Hills -- has been suspended over alleged poor hygiene standards. Dr Starkenburg, 75, is one of 6 dentists suspended over poor hygiene control and is listed by ACON as providing \"HIV-friendly\" bulk-billed dental work. He said he had been rated an \"old duffer\" when it came to sterilisation standards. But since being investigated by NSW Health he said he had spent AUD 3000 [about USD 2300] on education courses. \"I fully agree I have to step up to 2015 standards and take on the new protocol,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. \"I don't infect my patients but I didn't have a spick and span office like the new guys. But I'm spicko now.\"\n\nBut he said the risk of transmission was low and that no cases had been reported thus far. \"It's believed there is a low risk of transmission of infectious diseases in these circumstances,\" he said. \"We have no evidence of infection at this point or if any transmission has occurred. We are hopeful that there will be no transmissions but there will be a risk.\" Dr McAnulty said the main concern was for patients who had undergone invasive procedures.\n\nProblems uncovered at the practices involved: \"the cleaning of instruments, the knowledge of the practitioners and the recording of the results of the sterilising equipment,\" he said. Patients who have had an invasive procedure at either of The Gentle Dentist practices during the last 10 years or any procedure at Dr Robert Starkenburg's practices are recommended to have testing for blood borne virus infections. Your doctor can organise blood tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infection and results should be available within 7 to 10 days. For further information call the NSW Health information line on 1800 610 344. NSW Health is also trying to contact patients from the clinics to inform them of the potential risk of exposure.\n\nDr Starkenburg has been suspended from practising, along with 4 dentists from The Gentle Dentist clinic. Another 3 dentists from that clinic have had conditions placed on their registrations.\n\nNSW Health is also trying to contact patients from the clinics to inform them of the potential risk of exposure.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This alert is an exposure of inadequacies in infection control procedures in several dental practices in New South Wales. There has been no confirmation of actual transmission onwards of HIV and hepatitis viruses from any of these clinics, but the risk is present and all procedures should be revised. It is incumbent on the dental practitioner to protect their patients from the transmission of blood-borne disease. It is unclear from this account whether any of the patients were at risk of infection from the dentist, or as a consequence of inadequate sterility of instruments.

This trend reminds us that we cannot become complacent.\"\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, key public health programs helped reduce the transmission of HIV and other STDs. Routine testing of pregnant women has almost eliminated the number of Rhode Island babies born to mothers with HIV. Likewise, needle exchange programs have drastically reduced transmission among injection drug users.\n\nThe recent uptick in STDs in Rhode Island follows a national trend. The increase has been attributed to better testing by providers and to high-risk behaviors that have become more common in recent years. High-risk behaviors include using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters, having sex without a condom, having multiple sex partners, and having sex while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nEducation about prevention, routine testing, and treatment are priorities for HEALTH. The Department works with other state agencies and community partners to promote free and low-cost HIV and STD testing services throughout Rhode Island and to provide a variety of resources for clinicians to test, treat, and counsel patients and their sexual partners. In addition, the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) works under a federal grant to make sexual health education more accessible to high school students, to increase awareness of and education about STDs, to correct misinformation among young people that may put them at higher risk of getting an STD, and to promote evidence-based prevention practices, including abstinence.\n\n\"These new data underscore the importance of encouraging young people to begin talking to a doctor, nurse, or health educator about sexual health before becoming sexually active and especially after becoming sexually active,\" said Rosemary Reilly-Chammat, EdD, RIDE HIV/AIDS Sexuality Specialist. \"It's never too early to learn about making HIV and STD testing part of routine healthcare. Doctors and nurses are trained to discuss sensitive topics like sex, and conversations with them are confidential. Health educators at schools or community health centers are great resources too.\"\n\nSTDs are spread through anal, oral, or vaginal sex, and by skin-to-skin contact. People with undiagnosed or untreated STDs can develop long-term health problems and pass the disease to their sexual partners. Anyone who is sexually active can stop the spread of STDs and HIV:\n- Practice safer sex. Use condoms or a dental dam each time you have sex. Birth control pills and spermicides do not prevent STDs.\n- Get tested regularly for STDs and HIV. In Rhode Island, routine testing is recommended for anyone age 13 and older.\n- Know your partner(s)' sexual health status. Even if you are treated for an STD, you could get re-infected because your partner was not tested and treated too.\n- If you've been diagnosed with an STD, take the medication as prescribed and do not have sex with anyone until your healthcare provider says it is safe to do so.\n- Avoid sex or close physical contact if you or a sexual partner has symptoms of an STD and see a healthcare provider for treatment.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above reports on the rising incidence of syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Rhode Island, as is occurring in many localities in the United States and in many other countries around the world, associated with high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behaviors.

It's very recent,\" she said.\n\nAs of Thu 7 May 2015, 154 cases of HIV have been confirmed since December 2014 in southeastern Indiana, nearly all of them in Scott County, which has been at the center of the HIV outbreak tied to needle-sharing among IV drug users. The county typically sees only about 5 new HIV cases a year, state health officials said.\n\nFor its analysis, the CDC studied HIV specimens from 72 people who have tested positive in the outbreak and found that 69 of them had the same strain, state Department of Health spokesman Ken Severson said. The findings are a sobering reminder of how rapidly HIV can spread among IV drug users, said Beth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University. She also said it's a warning to health officials nationwide to monitor local users for HIV and hepatitis C, to help detect outbreaks. \"Injection-drug use is a very, very efficient mode of transmission, fast and efficient,\" she said.\n\nCDC spokeswoman Donnica Smalls said the agency is working on a final report that will include looking at whether the HIV strain in Indiana has surfaced elsewhere in the USA or is related to other strains. The CDC issued an alert to health departments nationwide in April 2015 urging them to take steps to identify and track HIV and hepatitis C cases to prevent outbreaks similar to Indiana's, which was detected in January 2015. High rates of hepatitis C are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential HIV outbreak, and the CDC said acute hepatitis C cases soared 150 percent from 2010 to 2013. About 80 percent of those infected with HIV in Indiana's outbreak are also infected with hepatitis C.\n\nMeyerson said the CDC's preliminary analysis drives home the importance of needle-exchange programs like a temporary program in Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. Such programs provide users with clean syringes and collect used ones to help prevent the spread of diseases. A new Indiana law spurred by the local outbreak allows communities to seek state approval to run needle exchanges if they can prove they're facing an HIV or hepatitis C epidemic fueled by IV drug use. Scott County is expected to soon ask Indiana's state health commissioner for permission to operate a year-long needle-exchange program under that law. Health officials said Thursday [14 May 2015] that more than 320 people have taken in the county's needle-exchange program, which has distributed more than 14 000 needles since it began in early April 2015.\n\n[Byline: Rick Callahan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak of HIV (and HCV) in Indiana among a cohort of injecting drug users clearly does underscore the efficiency of blood borne virus transmission when needles are shared.

Then came a new prescription opiate, Opana [oxymorphone], easily obtained on the street and more potent when crushed, dissolved in water, and injected. She did just that, many times a day, sometimes sharing needles with other addicts.\n\nLast month [April 2015], the thin, 45-year-old woman learned the unforgiving consequences. She tested positive for HIV, 1 of nearly 150 cases in this socially conservative, largely rural region just north of the Kentucky border. Now a life long hobbled by addiction is, like so many others here [in Austin, Scott County, Indiana], consumed by fear. She is afraid to start antiretroviral therapy because she does not want to be spotted entering the clinic on Main Street, she says, and afraid to learn her prognosis after hearing a rumor, false, it turns out, that someone else with the virus was given 6 months to live. Other drug users have refused to be tested at all.\n\n\"I thought it was just a homosexual disease,\" the woman said one recent evening, twisting a tissue in her manicured hands as tears filled her eyes. She asked that her name not be published out of concerns about being stigmatized. \"I didn't ever think it would be in my small hometown.\"\n\nThe crisis would test even a large metropolis; Austin [Indiana] population 4200, is overwhelmed despite help from the CDC, the state, and nonprofit groups like the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. HIV had been all but unknown here, and misinformation is rife. Attempts to halt the outbreak have been hindered by strong but misguided local beliefs about how to address it, according to people involved in the response.\n\nGov. Mike Pence reluctantly authorized a needle exchange program last month [April 2015], but local officials are not running it according to best practices, outside experts say. Austin residents still must wait for addiction treatment, even though they have been given priority. And getting those who are HIV-positive on medication, and making sure they adhere to the protocol, has been difficult.\n\nOfficials [in Austin] say the need for education is urgent and deep; even local health workers are learning as they go. Brittany Combs, the public health nurse for Scott County, said she was stunned to discover from talking to addicts that many were using the same needle up to 300 times, until it broke off in their arms. Some were in the habit of using nail polish to mark syringes as their own, but with needles scarce and houses full of people frequently shooting up together, efforts to avoid sharing often failed. Ms Combs also learned that many addicts were uncomfortable visiting a needle distribution center that opened 4 Apr 2015 on the outskirts of town. So she started taking needles directly to users in their neighborhoods.\n\nAt the same time, HIV specialists from Indianapolis, who have evaluated about 50 people with the virus here so far and started about 20 of them on antiretroviral drugs, are fighting a barrage of misinformation about the virus in Scott County, where almost all residents are white, few go to college, and 1 in 5 live in poverty, according to the census. \"There are still a significant proportion of people in Austin who have biases about HIV and are contributing to the stigma and subsequent fear,\" said Dr Diane Janowicz, an infectious disease specialist at Indiana University, who is treating HIV patients here. \"I have to reassure them: If your grandkid wants a sip of your drink, you can share it. It's OK to eat at the same table. You can use the same bathroom.\"\n\nMany whose HIV has been newly diagnosed here have strikingly high amounts of it in their blood, Dr Janowicz said, and in one patient the HIV has progressed to AIDS. Nonetheless, she said, \"if they take their medicine for HIV, this is a chronic disease, not something they have to die from.\"\n\nAnother complication is that the needle exchange has faced strong local resistance. Mr Pence, a Republican, generally opposes such programs, saying they perpetuate drug use. Many residents here feel the same.\n\n\"If you would have asked me last year [2014] if I was for a needle exchange program, I would have said you're nuts,\" Ms Combs said. \"I thought, just like a lot of people do, that it's enabling, that you're just giving needles out and assisting them in their drug habit. But then I did the research on it, and there's 28 years of research to prove that it actually works.\"\n\nBut researchers say Scott County's hastily created exchange has several features that could sharply curb its effectiveness. To get clean needles, drug users have to register, using their birth date and a few letters with their name to create an identification number that goes on a laminated card. The police are arresting anyone found with needles but no card, saying it will prod more people to participate.\n\nShortly after the needle exchange began, sheriff's deputies visited a house in Austin and found a man who had joined the program and a woman who had not. They did not arrest the man, Sheriff Dan McClain said, although they confiscated a number of clean needles he had received from a volunteer group that was not part of the official program. But they did arrest the woman, who had \"a freshly used needle lying next to her\" in a bed spattered with blood, Sheriff McClain said. \"If they've got one needle and they're not in the program, they're going to jail,\" Sheriff McClain said.\n\nDr Don Des Jarlais, the director of research for the chemical dependency institute at Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital in New York, said the most successful needle exchange programs let participants pass out syringes to peers who remain in the shadows instead of requiring everyone to sign up. Arresting drug users who are not officially enrolled in the program \"makes it hard to build trust,\" Dr Des Jarlais said, adding, \"You're not going to be able to get enough syringes out to really stop the epidemic if you have those types of restrictions.\"\n\nLocal supporters of the needle exchange say a limited program is better than none, and believe that improvements will come with time. Last week [week of 27 Apr 2015], the state legislature sent a bill to Mr Pence that would allow communities to create needle exchange programs for up to a year if they are experiencing an epidemic of HIV or hepatitis C because of intravenous drug use. Mr Pence said he would sign the measure, noting in a statement that it would allow only \"limited and accountable\" needle exchange programs, and only \"where public health emergencies warrant such action.\"\n\nFor now, the program here is giving out a maximum of 140 clean needles per user per week to whoever goes to the outreach center or accepts them from the roaming minivan. Ms Combs said some people told her they injected as often as 15 times a day, and the exchange is erring on the side of providing slightly more than people need. She has passed out needles at a house where the owner, an older woman known as Momma, sits on the porch while a steady stream of visitors comes to shoot up inside. She has knocked on the door of a trailer where, she said, \"multiple family members live and the daughters all prostitute themselves out and everyone is doing drugs.\" One recent afternoon, on a street fragrant with lilacs, a young woman on a bicycle declined Ms Combs's offer of clean needles, saying she already had some -- and HIV. \"I know I need the medicine to slow it down,\" she murmured.\n\nAt a run-down house with a wheelchair on the porch, a woman, 27, walked out to greet the van, saying, \"The needles ain't lasting me long enough.\" She beckoned 2 men out of the house to get some, too. \"This little boy right here needs a card,\" she told Ms Combs, gesturing toward an expressionless friend whose eyes kept slipping shut. \"You got some extra Neosporin and stuff? Because look how bad his arms is.\"\n\nThe van moved on, stopping as someone yelled from a white house with a broad lawn. A woman in a pink tank top emerged, saying a neighbor had taken some of her clean needles and her daughter's, too. The daughter could not come out of the house, she had just injected and \"can't get up from the kitchen table,\" the mother said. Ms Combs gave the woman needles for her and her daughter. \"Spread the word that this white vehicle is a friendly mobile,\" she said.\n\nAs of Tue 5 May 2015, the exchange had distributed 9491 needles to 223 people, including many repeat customers. About 8300 needles had been returned to the exchange, but not all of them came from the exchange program.\n\nSome participants say they are happy to have clean needles but would be happier in treatment. While some intravenous drug users from Austin have recently gone into treatment at a residential center in Jeffersonville, about 30 miles [48.3 km] away, others are still waiting for a bed.\n\nA 23-year-old user with HIV said he had gone to the community outreach center to get clean needles and seek addiction treatment, but was put on a waiting list. 2 weeks later, he is still waiting. Opana remains easy to get, he added, a quarter of a pill selling for USD 40, enough of a dose to ease his withdrawal symptoms and enable him to get out of bed.\n\nOne unexpected benefit of the HIV outbreak, according to the woman who tested positive and fears starting treatment, is that the men who used to stream into town daily, seeking young female addicts who would prostitute themselves in exchange for drug money, have all but disappeared. \"It took HIV to change our town,\" she said. \"Those of us who are affected are devastated, but I'm glad HIV is here.\"\n\n[Byline: Abby Goodnough]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Oxymorphone (Opana, Numorphan, Numorphone) or 14-hydroxydihydromorphinone (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymorphone) is a powerful semi-synthetic opioid analgesic (painkiller) first developed in Germany in 1914, patented in the USA by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 1955 and introduced to the USA market in January 1959 and other countries around the same time.\n\nAs indicated in an earlier post regarding this cluster, other blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C are also important in such situations. Hepatitis B tends to be less of an issue because of universal HBV immunization in the USA. When acquired, both HIV and HCV are generally associated with chronic infection, whereas HBV is generally not.\n\nWhile needle-exchange programs are quite effective in decreasing blood-borne infections transmitted by sharing needles and have not been shown to be associated with an increased amount of injectable substance abuse, the program needs to be administered appropriately, which does not seem to be the case in this situation.\n\nIt is important to stress that HIV infection is a very manageable disease in the era of the availability of well-tolerated anti-retroviral treatments. However, this is not the case if the infected individual is more afraid of the treatment and its stigma or does not know that he or she is infected. Aggressive information programs about HIV, together with HIV screening, should minimize these factors. As a practicing infectious diseases clinician and academician, I see our treated HIV infected individuals doing extremely well with the HIV infection being the least of their health issues. Treatment is available through health insurance or drug assistance programs. Preventing infection by education and minimizing any high risk behaviors is much less expensive than chronic anti-retroviral therapy which is, in turn, much less expensive than having to deal with the late medical complications and hospitalizations of late stage HIV disease.\n\nThe state of Indiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35942.

The increase in the discovery of hepatitis C is being attributed to free testing conducted as a result of the HIV and hepatitis C outbreak in Scott, Jackson, Clark, Perry, and Washington counties, according to a news release from the health department.\n\nAt least 79 cases of HIV have been reported in that outbreak, and most have been traced to people sharing needles used for injecting Opana [oxymorphone], a pain medication. Hepatitis C can be spread by sharing needles for injecting drugs, tattooing, or piercing. It also can be sexually transmitted, but that is less common. Reports indicate many more cases of hepatitis C may exist and simply have not been confirmed or diagnosed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\nThe state of Indiana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/217.

The problem comes in tandem with rising intravenous use of heroin and prescription painkillers nationwide.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear last week [25 Mar 2015] signed a bill into law aimed at combating the state's epidemic of heroin and painkiller abuse. One provision allows local health departments to set up needle exchanges after obtaining approval from city and county governments.\n\nAnd in Indiana, a surge in HIV cases linked to injecting the prescription painkiller Opana [oxymorphone] in a rural county prompted Republican Gov. Mike Pence to declare a public-health emergency last week [26 Mar 2015]. He issued an executive order authorizing the temporary dispensing of clean needles in Scott County, near the Kentucky border, despite his personal opposition to such programs and a state law barring them.\n\nExchanges allow drug users to anonymously obtain clean syringes and dispose of used ones. The aim is to help people avoid sharing needles that may be contaminated with viruses or other pathogens.\n\nPolitical opposition to such exchanges can run deep, especially in conservative areas. While backers contend the programs reduce the transmission of disease and potentially connect addicts with treatment programs, opponents say they sanction drug use and dissuade users from seeking help. Now, \"the opiate epidemic is changing the political calculus around syringe exchanges,\" said Daniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition, an advocacy organization on health issues related to drug use.\n\nOther states and municipalities have helped pave the way for needle exchanges. In the past few years, Nevada passed a measure allowing them, while 2 cities in Ohio have set them up -- Cincinnati and Portsmouth, both on the Kentucky border. This year, Florida lawmakers are weighing a proposal to launch a pilot needle-exchange program in Miami-Dade County.\n\nThe US has about 200 syringe programs in 33 states and the District of Columbia, according to the North American Syringe Exchange Network, a nonprofit. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy supports such exchanges. Federal funding for them is banned by law, but they can receive local, state and not-for-profit funding.\n\nWhile the HIV outbreak in Indiana alarms public-health experts, many worry more about hepatitis C. It spreads more easily among people who share needles and other injection equipment than HIV does, because it can live outside the body longer, said Kathie Kane-Willis, director of the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy. Hepatitis C can survive outside the body for at least 16 hours, and possibly up to 4 days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said; HIV doesn't survive long outside the body.\n\n[Byline: Arian Campo-Flores, Jeanne Whalen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most diagnoses of hepatitis C are not finding newly infected patients as almost all are already chronically infected. Although in many areas it is a political \"hot potato\", needle exchange programs are effective in decreasing transmission of blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV by avoiding sharing of needles. There is no evidence to support that such programs increase the use of illicit injectable drugs. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nHepatitis C & B - USA: (OH) 20150201.3134453\n2014\n----\nHepatitis C - USA (05): (ND) 20141014.2863419\nHepatitis C - USA (04): (ND) nursing home 20140514.2469954\nHepatitis C - USA (03): (MA) 20140422.2417891\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (NY) possible insulin syringe exposure 20140314.2330501\nHepatitis C - USA (02): (MN) 20140306.2317087\nHepatitis C - USA: (CO) nosocomial, 2011-2012, RFI 20140101.2146381\n2013\n----\nHepatitis C - USA (06): (WY) increasing incidence 20131126.2076471\nHepatitis C - USA (05): New York City, correction 20131118.2061773\nHepatitis C - USA (05): New York City, increasing incidence 20131113.2053830\nHepatitis C - USA (04): (ND), acute 20131020.2011334\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (05): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130920.1958804\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (04): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130607.1760955\nHepatitis C - USA (03): (NH) nosocomial 20130607.1760734\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (03): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130504.1691297\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130420.1660335\nHepatitis C - USA (02): (OH) increased incidence in Ross county 20130330.1611310\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (OK), possible dental exposure, alert 20130329.1609886\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/lm", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3249575", "archive_id": "3249575", "date": "2015-03-23 22:57:00", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis, HIV/AIDS - Sudan: (KH) discarded medical waste, risk, alert, RFI", "main_text": "HEPATITIS, HIV/AIDS - SUDAN: (KHARTOUM) DISCARDED MEDICAL WASTE, RISK, ALERT, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*****************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 22 Mar 2015\nSource: Radio Dabanga [edited]\nhttps://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/contaminated-medical-waste-alert-in-sudan-s-capital\n\n\nThe Minister of Health for Khartoum State has warned of hepatitis and HIV/AIDS transmission through medical waste.

In all of [2014], there were 26 confirmed cases.\n\nDr. David Allison, medical officer of health for Eastern Health, said the number of cases has steadily increased over the last decade. \"That's way above the number of cases of syphilis we would expect to see in this period of time and it really seems to be growing and growing,\" Dr. Allison told CBC News Tuesday.\n\nMost of the new cases involve males between the ages of 20 and 49 who have had sexual intercourse with men [MSM].\n\nThe health authority is going public in order to raise awareness and hopefully prevent further infections. Dr. Allison said it's important that those engaging in sex outside of a monogamous relationship protect themselves by wearing a condom.\n\nSyphilis is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) contracted through unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex. Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are the most effective way to prevent the sexual transmission of syphilis.\n\nOf the 41 cases of syphilis reported since January 2014, Allison said 10 have been co-infected with HIV. Syphilis increases the potential for the spread of HIV infection, Allison explained. \"One of the challenges with syphilis is that because it's an ulcer causing infection, at least in the initial stages, it can contribute to the transmission of HIV by making the virus easier to pass along from one person to another,\" he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail recently reported on the increasing incidence of syphilis in Newfoundland and Labrador, in December 2014 (Syphilis - Canada (06): (NL) incr. incidence, MSM, RFI 20141201.3000711). The news report above indicates that the syphilis outbreak in Newfoundland, which is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), is continuing in the 1st quarter of 2015. Outbreaks of syphilis among MSM are occurring worldwide, including other parts of Canada (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below).\n\nThe news report above indicates that this outbreak is occurring in the Eastern Region of the province, which includes the peninsulas of Bonavista, Burin, and Avalon. Presumably the outbreak is concentrated on the Avalon Peninsula where half of the province's population (262 410) lives, especially in the city of St. John's, the province's capital and largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Peninsula).\n\nThe report does not characterize the affected population other than saying that new cases of syphilis are primarily occurring in MSM between the ages of 20 and 49 and that almost 25 percent are co-infected with HIV. The report does not say if the number of new cases of HIV infection is actually increasing, other than saying that the increase in syphilis \"can contribute to the transmission of HIV\" in the province.\n\nHowever, a rising incidence of syphilis may not necessarily be accompanied by a rising incidence of HIV infection; there may be a discordant trend, with an increasing incidence of syphilis and a falling or stable incidence of HIV infection. In fact, in a prior ProMED-mail post (Syphilis - Canada (02): background 20120211.1038978), Dr. Steve Berger pointed out that the increasing incidence of syphilis in Canada since the year 2000 was accompanied by a continued decline in the incidence of HIV infection.\n\nAs an explanation, another recent ProMED-mail post reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM, without causing a rising incidence of HIV infection (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).\n\nAlso, we are not told if this outbreak is associated with use of mobile phone dating apps, such as Tinder and Grindr. Grindr is a smartphone app that uses global-positioning technology to find anonymous sex partners within close proximity who are also on Grindr (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr).\n\nFurther information about the syphilis outbreak in Newfoundland from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/375.]\nSee Also\n2014\n----\nSyphilis - Canada (06): (NL) incr. incidence, MSM, RFI 20141201.3000711\nSyphilis - Canada (05): increased incidence, MSM, smartphone apps 20141104.2927012\nSyphilis - Canada (04): (MO) incr. incidence, MSM, smartphone app, HIV-coinfect 20141027.2906054\nSyphilis - Canada (03): (PE) rising incidence, RFI 20140926.2806438\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - Australia: MSM, decreasing condom use 20140920.2789253\nSyphilis - Canada (02): (BC) rising incidence, predominantly MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140822.2715216\nSyphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642\nSyphilis - Canada: (SK) increased incidence, Internet, social networking 20140419.2415809\n2013\n----\nSyphilis - Canada (04): (NU) increased cases, RFI 20131207.2098056\nSyphilis - Canada (03): (BC) increased incidence, MSM, urban 20130608.1761566\nSyphilis - Canada (02): (NS) MSM, mobile phone apps 20130320.1594646\nSyphilis - Canada: (NU) RFI 20130214.1542486\n2012\n----\nSyphilis - Canada (04): (NS) MSM, Internet 20121019.1353614\nSyphilis - Canada (03): (NU) RFI 20120912.1291334\nSyphilis - Canada (02): background 20120211.1038978\nSyphilis - Canada: (NB) 20120210.1038543\n.................................................sb/ml/pg/jw", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3230174", "archive_id": "3230174", "date": "2015-03-14 22:52:03", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Spain: HIV infected individuals", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - SPAIN: HIV INFECTED INDIVIDUALS\n*********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 11 Mar 2015\nSource: Noticias SIN [in Spanish, machine transl, edited]\nhttp://www.noticiassin.com/2015/03/un-estudio-muestra-una-alta-incidencia-de-hepatitis-e-en-pacientes-con-vih/\n\n\nAn investigation carried out in Spain found a high incidence of hepatitis E (HEV) in HIV-infected patients. The incidence of hepatitis by HEV was detected in this work to 7.2 cases per 100 patients per year. This is a prospective work done in 698 HIV-infected patients without antibodies in the blood of HEV, who were followed for 1 year. The study described the clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis E in patients infected with HIV, whose form of presentation was primarily a febrile syndrome with or without elevated liver enzymes. In the study, led by Antonio Rivero Juarez, researcher of the study group of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (GeSIDA), a higher incidence of hepatitis E was noted in the rural areas (17.4 cases per 100 patients per year), and no relationship was found between hepatitis E and other possible risk factors associated with HIV or coinfection with hepatitis B or C.\n\nDeveloped at the Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research of Cordoba by a team of scientific experts in infectious diseases, the study was presented at the Congress on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), the most important scientific meeting of the world on this matter, held last week in Seattle (Washington state, USA).\n\nHEV is an RNA virus that has been described with 4 genotypes of different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted primarily by contaminated drinking water, and to a lesser extent by person-to-person contact, affecting exclusively humans in the form of disease outbreaks. On the contrary, genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic infections and endemic, whose reservoirs are pigs, wild boars and other animals living free, being transmitted by direct contact or consumption of meat from infected animals. Recent studies in slaughterhouses and chains of European food production suggest that the high presence of HEV genotype 3 in animal products for human consumption, and the spread of the HEV genotype 3 to humans through this track could become important.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks.

Swine HEV was 1st isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with hepatitis-splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan.

It seems he was able to operate a long time without any proper checks.\"\n\nSrun Sok, director of the Health Ministry's hospital services department, which oversees the licensing of doctors and clinics, said in a recent interview that his ministry was unaware of Mr. Chrin's practice. \"We didn't know, because there were no reports on this person,\" he said. \"It must be the commune chief or chief of the commune health center that reports it to the district level,\" which then informs the provincial health department.\n\nHowever, By Beng Sor, who took over as director of the Roka health center about a year ago, said he was not aware that he was meant to be responsible for reporting on health-care workers operating without a license. \"I have never reported any,\" said Mr. Beng Sor, noting that Mr. Chrin had been working in the commune for more than a decade. \"If they had asked me to, I would have.\"\n\nSeth Savuth, the former director of the commune health center, claimed that in 2012, he reported at least 2 unlicensed health-care workers in Roka commune -- including Mr. Chrin -- to district health officials. But the director of the Sangke operational district's health department, Im Chetra, who oversees the Roka health center, said he never received any reports with Mr. Chrin's name on them. \"I have not seen his name on the reports,\" Mr. Chetra said, adding that while it is easy to crack down on unlicensed clinics, tracking down unlicensed doctors who make house calls is far more difficult.\n\nAccording to the Health Ministry, the number of unlicensed clinics dropped from 87 in 2010 to zero in 2011, a figure maintained in 2012 and 2013. The Health Ministry's Mr. Sok stressed that these statistics only reflect unlicensed practices being run out of a building. \"Currently, we are worried about mobile health workers working illegally,\" he said.\n\nWhenever [one particular patient] had a headache or fever, she would ask Mr. Chrin to visit her home and administer an injection or intravenous drip. [The patient], 25, said she cannot recall what the doctor injected her with, but that his treatments helped and were offered pro bono when she did not have enough money to pay for them. \"I usually had injections and IV drips from him when I had a headache and fever,\" she said. \"I got injections not only from him, but also from other doctors who are in my village,\" she added. \"I had injections with other doctors when he was busy with other patients.\"\n\nChris Grundmann, country director for the University Research Co., which implements programs funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development to improve health care services, said Cambodians often do not feel that they are getting treated properly unless an injection is administered. \"What most people want when they go to a village doctor is an injection of some sort or an IV drip,\" he said. \"A lot of times, it is a vitamin injection, which is not particularly useful, but [it] is what people want.\"\n\nMr. Sok said Roka commune residents likely choose to be treated by private, unlicensed doctors because the commune health center only administers injections in emergency situations, or as part of a vaccination program. \"The people working at [commune] health centers do not have the knowledge,\" he said. \"We believe that their capacity, knowledge and skills are not sufficient to provide injections [on demand].\"\n\nSten Vermund, an HIV expert at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, whose research focuses on developing countries, said it would probably take a long period of time to infect hundreds of people with HIV simply by reusing syringes. \"I think it's improbable that 200 people would get infected in a single episode of needle-syringe contamination because there is a diluting effect,\" Dr. Vermund said. \"But it might have been repetitive behavior on the part of the doctor.\"\n\nRoka commune residents who have tested positive for HIV include a 4-month-old and a man in his 80s, and migrant workers who had been out of the country for a year. Considering the range of villagers testing positive for the virus, Dr. Vermund said other possible sources of the infection, via medical practices by so-called \"injectionists,\" could be the improper use of multi-dose vials. He said that if Mr. Chrin had been using multi-dose vials -- common in developing countries because they are less expensive -- he might have injected an HIV-positive patient and then dipped the needle back into the vials to draw up another dose. \"People can make that mistake, where they've inoculated the bottle of medicine so now the next 9 doses coming out of that bottle are contaminated, even if they do use a new needle and syringe,\" he said. \"So you can make the mistake once, and everyone down the line pays the price, even if subsequent needles and syringes are sterile.\"\n\nDr. Vermund added that if Mr. Chrin had been using a saline solution to prepare medications for injection, he might also have contaminated a large supply of the solution by double-dipping a contaminated needle. \"It has to be an absolutely strict protocol [for infection prevention],\" he said. \"You can't make one mistake out of ten; you have to make zero mistakes.\"\n\nA foreign doctor working in Cambodia, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order not to jeopardize his frequent work with the Health Ministry, said the dangerous practices mentioned by Dr. Vermund were common in the country. \"These bad practices exist in Cambodia because there often aren't the right supplies,\" the doctor said. \"In Cambodia, they don't have single-dose vials for all medications; they often have multi-dose vials.\"\n\nDr. Vermund said that if authorities have confiscated medical tools used by Mr. Chrin that have HIV on them, the virus could be compared to that in villagers' blood. \"You can do a molecular evaluation to see whether the doctor's needles have the same viral subtype,\" he said. \"That would increase the evidence immensely. If they want to definitively evaluate this, it can be done.\"\n\n[Byline: Alex Consiglio, Hay Pisey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKathryn Snow\nMelbourne School of Population and Global Health\nMelbourne, Australia\n<kathryn.snow@unimelb.edu.au>\n\n[The above news article is a follow-up report on the HIV outbreak, which is occurring mainly in Roka commune, Sangke District, Battambang Province, Cambodia, that was recently posted by ProMED-mail (HIV - Cambodia: (BA) contaminated medical equipment susp., RFI 20141219.3042986).

In the ensuing days, at least 90 more villagers between the ages of 4 and 80 have also tested positive for the virus, she said. Among those tested were a pair of 4-year-old twins, one of whom tested positive, Ms. Pov added.\n\n\"People in the villages have panicked so much. That is why today [17 Dec 2014], roughly 100 more local villagers have come to the Roka commune health center to get their blood tested,\" she said. About 660 residents of Roka commune have visited the health center to get their blood examined over the past 6 days, Ms. Pov said, with those testing positive sent to the provincial referral hospital for a 2nd round of testing.\n\nUNAIDS country representative Marie-Odile Emond said that HIV tests carried out at the commune level were usually accurate. \"The community tests are used internationally but are conducted by human beings,\" she said. \"So there could be a small percentage of tests where positives are actually negatives.\"\n\nMs. Emond said that of the 3 most common HIV transmission paths -- mother-to-child, sexual intercourse, and intravenous drug use -- none seemed likely to be the cause of the recent infections in Battambang. \"This is a unique situation where both children and adults of different ages are infected,\" she said. \"The use of unsterilized medical instruments is a possible cause.\"\n\nIeng Mouly, chairman of the National AIDS Authority, said a team of investigators was sent to Battambang on Tuesday [16 Dec 2014]. \"The investigation is about the use of needles, and tomorrow [18 Dec 2014], we will have a clearer picture of the cause,\" Mr. Mouly said. \"We have suspicion of an NGO that gave vaccinations 6 months ago and the use of needles by a local nurse.\"\n\nMean Chhi Vun, director of the Health Ministry's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STD (NCHADS), said his center had also sent a team to Battambang. Hea Sik, head of the HIV/AIDS Program in Sangke district, said locals were also speculating that a health care worker was to blame for the epidemic. \"We don't know the cause of the infection, but many people reported to us that they suspected they were infected through injection by a local medical practitioner,\" he said.\n\nIn Roka village, a 63-year-old farmer who tested positive for HIV on Tuesday [16 Dec 2014], and who declined to give his name due to the stigma attached to the disease, said he was \"shocked.\" \"I'm pretty shocked, as I'm just a poor farmer and do not have any sexual intercourse with others,\" he said. His 3 children -- aged 12, 20 and 30 -- tested negative, he said. Two of his grandchildren, however, came up positive in the initial test for the disease. \"My 2 grandchildren -- a 10-year-old and 9-year-old girl, whose parents tested negative -- have been found to be infected,\" he said.\n\nThe man said his family rarely travels to the commune health center for medical problems, and instead visits a private practitioner, who treated his granddaughters for typhoid about a year ago. Ms. Pov, the commune chief, said the local medical practitioner whom she suspected of transmitting the disease through unsterilized medical instruments fled the commune on Sunday [14 Dec 2014].\n\nCambodia has been internationally lauded for its success in fighting HIV, having reduced the rate of infection among people between the ages of 15 and 49 from 1.7 percent in the late 1990s to 0.7 percent today.\n\n[Byline: Kuch Naren, Maria Paula Brito]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Battambang is a province in northwestern Cambodia.

Only Thailand, with an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.4 percent in 2007, ranked higher than Cambodia. The prevalence rate is undoubtedly much higher in certain high-risk sub-populations, such as injecting drug users, people in prostitution, and men who have sex with men.\n\nCambodia's HIV/AIDS epidemic is spread primarily through heterosexual transmission and revolves largely around the sex trade, their clients and sex partners, and sex partners of clients. The HIV prevalence was 14.7 percent among brothel-based female sex workers in Cambodia in 2006 (http://cambodia.usembassy.gov/cdc_office.html).\n\nThe proportion of women among HIV-infected persons was 52 percent in 2006, and according to a UNAIDS report, 1/3rd of new HIV-infected cases are due to mother-to-child transmission (http://www.newhopeforcambodianchildren.com/aids_in_cambodia.html). The HIV prevalence was 1.1 percent among pregnant women in 2006 (http://cambodia.usembassy.gov/cdc_office.html).\n\nThe HIV outbreak in Roka Commune has so far involved at least 90 villagers between the ages of 4 and 80 years of age. According to the news report above, the usual modes of HIV transmission such as mother-to-child, sexual intercourse and intravenous drug use seem unlikely in this outbreak. Use of HIV-contaminated medical equipment is suspected to be the likely cause.

Officials with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) issued a bulletin to health-care providers across the city on [Fri 204 Oct 2014] revealing there have been 60 cases reported in the 1st 10 months of 2014 -- the fastest-spreading and highest number ever recorded in the Winnipeg Health Region. 8 to 10 cases are being reported per month, up from only 1 or 2 between 2007 and 2012.\n\n\"Most cases are being diagnosed in men who have sex with men,\" the bulletin reads. \"About 1/3 of cases are HIV-positive and cases are spread evenly throughout all community areas in Winnipeg. \"Cases have also been reported in all other\" regional health authorities. The numbers are enough for the WRHA to declare the uptick in new cases an outbreak.\n\nPatients testing positive for the infection must fill out a questionnaire that, among other things, asks about their sexual history. Health officials have also held information sessions and purchased advertising warning of the outbreak on social media sites.\n\nJoss Reimer, medical officer of health for the WRHA, said about half of the new cases are admitting to having anonymous sex with partners they've met on hookup sites like Grindr and Squirt.\n\nThe rise in numbers isn't unique to Winnipeg. Reimer said other major Canadian cities have also seen a rise in syphilis cases in recent years. So have other health regions in Manitoba, albeit not at the same rate as Winnipeg, she said.\n\nSymptoms of syphilis, which is spread by direct sexual contact with infectious lesions that usually develop on or near the genitals, include painless genital or oral ulcers, and progressing to include a rash all over the body and abnormal lymph nodes.\n\nReimer said the high number of cases involving HIV-positive patients may be a sign of people knowing they shouldn't have unprotected intercourse, but mistakenly believing they can engage in unprotected oral sex without consequence.\n\nThe infection is easily curable if caught early, Reimer said, noting it could take as little as one round of antibiotics to eliminate it. The danger is in those who don't treat it. The infection can lie dormant in a person's body for years, but eventually cause such things as dementia if left unchecked. The best way to avoid trouble isn't complicated, Reimer said. If you're sexually active, use protection and ask your doctor for testing for sexually transmitted infections on a regular basis. \"Make it a part of your health routine to be tested regularly,\" she said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In many countries, the increased incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site.

[The Lower Mainland is the region surrounding and including the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada, with 59 percent of BC's total population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Mainland).] In 2013, 561 new cases were reported in BC and 86 per cent of those were diagnosed in Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH),\" says Dr. Reka Gustafson, medical health officer with VCH. \"We're encouraging men who have sex with men to become more aware about syphilis, practice safer sex, and to incorporate regular testing into their health care.\"\n\nAn awareness campaign has helped increase testing rates by 20 per cent in 2013 compared to the year before. More than 48 000 men were tested in Vancouver in 2013. A similar campaign was launched this summer [2014] to encourage more men to get tested. The campaign uses trending topics in social media to discuss the rising rates and includes posters and a webpage at http://www.checkhimout.ca/syphilis/.\n\n\"We're grateful to have partnerships with agencies that work directly with gay and bisexual men,\" says Chris Buchner, regional director of prevention, VCH. \"With help from organizations including Qmunity, YouthCO, Health Initiative for Men (HIM), Positive Living BC, family doctors, and the BC Centre for Disease Control, we're hoping to engage people with a respectful and relevant message, and encourage them to test for syphilis regularly.\"\n\nSyphilis is a highly contagious disease spread primarily by sexual activity -- whether it's oral, vaginal or anal sex. Just being in close contact with an infected person's genitals, mouth or rectum is enough to expose a person to infection.\n\nIn 2013, the majority of all diagnosed cases in VCH were picked up through blood testing many weeks after people showed initial symptoms, when the infection became latent with no symptoms. Common early symptoms of syphilis include painless ulcers or sores resembling bug bites on genitalia, rashes on the palms and soles, fever, swollen lymph glands and weight loss. If left untreated, these symptoms disappear and syphilis then enters an asymptomatic or latent stage, which can eventually lead to permanent blindness, hearing loss, deep bone pain and neurological problems. Severe cases of the disease can be fatal.\n\nPregnant women can also pass syphilis to an unborn child resulting in stillbirth, pre-term birth and abnormalities in the baby.\n\nSyphilis also increases the risk of getting HIV; in fact, there are high rates of syphilis among people who are HIV positive. In VCH, 69 per cent of all syphilis cases are also HIV positive.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The increase in the occurrence of syphilis in 2013 in British Columbia, Canada, is occurring mainly in the city of Vancouver and its environs, and, as the news article above reports, is in part due to enhanced case detection, but there is also likely a true increased incidence of syphilis.\n\nThe rates of early syphilis in Canada, as in the United States, have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with early syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of early syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of early syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.\n\nIn many countries (see prior ProMED-mail posts below), the increased incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site.

The child was found to have detectable HIV levels in blood during a routine clinical care visit earlier this month [July 2014], according to a statement by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The levels of HIV in the blood were \"not high, but not trivial, said Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID.\n\n\"This case represents important research that still provides a tremendous learning opportunity about how rapid, early treatment affects the body's response to HIV, especially in newborns,\" said R. J. Simonds, vice president of program innovation and policy at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, in a statement. Besides the Mississippi baby, a child born in Los Angeles County was found to have no trace of the virus 9 months after starting anti-HIV treatment 4 hours after birth. The Los Angeles baby cannot be said to have been cured, because its treatment was never stopped.\n\n\"Obviously, as an individual patient, it's disappointing,\" said Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, in a telephone interview. \"But we're learning very important things. Our capability of detection isn't good enough. This reservoir is extraordinary, and we need to get better tools to measure it accurately.\"\n\nThe Mississippi child has resumed therapy and is doing well with no side effects, Fauci said.\n\n[Byline: Caroline Chen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There was huge hope that the \"Mississippi baby\" would live a life free of HIV. Antiretroviral drugs can keep the virus in check in the bloodstream, but HIV has hiding places -- known as reservoirs -- in the gut and brain. If treatment stops, then the virus emerges from its reservoirs and begins its assault afresh. It was hoped that starting drug treatment within hours of birth would prevent the reservoirs from forming. This seems not to have been the case.\n\nThis case was never going to lead to an HIV-cure for infected adults, who begin treatment months or years after infection. The Mississippi baby has become a reminder of how difficult HIV is to defeat and how distant a cure really is.\n\nThe child, nicknamed the \"Mississippi baby,\" did not receive any pre-natal HIV care. Because of a greater risk of infection, she was started on a powerful HIV treatment just hours after labour. She continued to receive treatment until 18 months old, when doctors could not locate her. When she returned 10 months later, no sign of infection was evident, though her mother had not given her HIV medication in the interim.\n\nRepeated tests showed no detectable HIV virus until last week. Doctors do not yet know why the virus re-emerged. A 2nd child with HIV was given early treatment just hours after birth in Los Angeles in April 2013. Subsequent tests indicated she had completely cleared the virus, but that child also received ongoing treatment. Only one adult is currently believed to have been cured of HIV. In 2007, Timothy Ray Brown received a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV. He has shown no signs of infection for more than 5 years.

Syphilis prevalence recently tied high numbers from more than 2 decades ago and is now twice the national average. Gonorrhea rates saw a sharp 18-percent increase between 2012 and 2013. Dr. Sean Schafer, a medical epidemiologist with the Oregon Health Authority, thinks the numbers are distressing. \"We haven't seen numbers like this since the late 1980s, early 1990s. And this year [2014] is looking like another bad year,\" he said.\n\nWhen syphilis is in its early stage of infection, it is the most contagious. The 1st symptoms of syphilis, a sore then a rash, often go undetected and a person can transmit the disease easily to another person. There was nearly a 25-percent increase of early syphilis cases between 2012 and 2013, from 312 to 404. This year [2014] has already seen 2 cases of congenital syphilis in infants, causing one death.\n\nSchafer reports that 96 percent of 2013 syphilis cases were in men, with 77 percent of them among men who have sex with men. More than 50 percent were coinfected with HIV. 77 percent of 2013 gonorrhea cases were also among men. Gonorrhea often has no symptoms and is unknowingly transmitted to other partners. HIV-infected gay men often choose HIV-positive partners to avoid using condoms, but they still can transmit STDs. Schafer recommends that all gay men and women younger than 24 should get a syphilis and gonorrhea test every year. Both STDs are easily treated with antibiotics if detected early.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail recently posted a report on the rising incidence of syphilis and gonococcal disease in the US state of Oregon (Syphilis - USA (08): (AK, OR) rising incidence, MSM, social networking apps 20140602.2513266).

And while there are many theories, no one has been able to prove one. In a modest public health clinic behind a gas station in Otimati in South Africa's rural KwaZulu/Natal Province, a team of Norwegian infectious disease specialists think they may have found a new explanation. It is far too soon to say whether they are right. But even skeptics say the explanation is biologically plausible. And if it is proved correct, a low-cost solution has the potential to prevent thousands of infections every year.\n\nThe Norwegian team believes that African women are more vulnerable to HIV because of a chronic, undiagnosed parasitic disease: genital schistosomiasis, often nicknamed \"schisto.\" The disease, also known as bilharzia and snail fever, is caused by parasitic worms picked up in infested river water. It can cause fragile sores in the far reaches of the vaginal canal that may serve as entry points for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Dr Eyrun F Kjetland, who leads the Otimati team, says that it is more common than syphilis or herpes, which can also open the way for HIV.\n\nAlso, the foreign bodies in the sores -- the worms and eggs -- attract CD4 cells, the immune system's sentinels, and those are the very cells that HIV attacks. The worms can be killed by a drug that can cost as little as 8 cents a pill. Dr Kjetland's team is trying to determine whether that will heal the sores in young women.\n\nSome prominent AIDS experts doubt the schistosomiasis theory, pointing out, for example, that urban women raised far from infested water also die of AIDS. But proponents of the theory say that 2 decades ago, many experts were just as skeptical of the idea that circumcision protected men against HIV. It was not until 2006 that 3 clinical trials proved it correct.\n\nSchistosomiasis \"is arguably the most important cofactor in Africa's AIDS epidemic,\" said Dr Peter J Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \"And it's a huge women's health issue: Everyone has heard of genital mutilation and obstetric fistulas. But mention this, and the headlights just go dim.\"\n\nThe idea is slowly gaining ground. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UN, the NIH, and the Danish and Norwegian governments have all given some grant support. But leaders of the 2 agencies that pay for the fight against global AIDS want more evidence before diverting funds from their campaigns for condoms, drugs, and circumcision. \"We need to track all these things down and see what's a cause and what's just another disease you have at the same time, like cervical cancer,\" said Dr Mark R Dybul, executive director of one of the agencies, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\nAn estimated 200 million Africans have had schistosomiasis. Although it is rarely fatal, the bleeding it causes in children can lead to anemia, stunted growth and learning problems. It is caused by tiny worms that live in freshwater snails and emerge with pointed heads that can penetrate the skin of people collecting water or washing clothes. Once inside, the worms mate, with the female living in a cleft in the male's body \"like a hot dog in a bun,\" Dr Kjetland said. One form, _Schistosoma haematobium_, nest in [the veins of] urinary tract [laying eggs winding up in the bladder wall to be urinated out to complete the life cycle] -- bloody urine is the classic symptom -- but a portion of the eggs end up in the vaginal wall, creating \"sandy patches\" of damaged tissue and calcified eggs.\n\nStudies by Dr Kjetland in Zimbabwe [see comment below] and South Africa and by Dr Jennifer A Downs of Weill Cornell Medical College in Tanzania have shown that women with the patches are about 3 times as likely as their neighbors to be infected with HIV.\n\nFor years, theories have abounded as to why African women become infected with HIV for example, that they are more likely to have overlapping sexual partners -- not always by choice -- while women elsewhere have boyfriends or husbands in series. That rape, incest, and domestic violence are rife in southern Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is worst. That syphilis and herpes are rampant. That impoverished, fatherless young women are forced to pay with sex for food, clothes, grades, and even car rides.\n\nThe schisto hypothesis can now be added to that list, but to some prominent experts it remains unlikely. One is Daniel Halperin, an epidemiologist now at the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Puerto Rico. He knows how it feels to be doubted: in the 1990s, he was the chief proponent of the theory that circumcision protected men against HIV. He argues that tropical West Africa, where schisto is common, has little HIV, while countries with little schisto, like arid Botswana and mountainous Swaziland, have sky-high HIV rates.\n\nDr Salim Abdool Karim, a renowned South African AIDS researcher who admires Dr Kjetland's work, is also skeptical. His team follows more than 1000 women in an area only 40 miles [64 km] from Otimati with equally high HIV rates.\n\n\"We've studied genital tracts in detail for 20 years, photographing them sequentially,\" he said, \"and we see no sandy patches.\" Upon hearing that, Dr Kjetland reached for the mounted magnifying scope she uses to examine girls. \"They're not looking in the right places,\" she said. Most gynecologists, she explained, are trained to look for cancer, which usually starts near the center of the cervix, while sandy patches are tucked away in crevices that can be seen only by swinging the scope to extreme angles. It takes her weeks to train doctors to find them consistently, she said.\n\n[Byline: Donald G McNeil Jr]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Schistosomes (http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2003/Schistosomiasis/cycle.htm) have a complex life cycle, in which cercariae, free-living in fresh water, can penetrate healthy human skin. The head of the cercaria transforms into an endoparasitic larva, the schistomule. The schistomules pass several days in the skin then enter the venous circulation and eventually migrate to the lungs (generally within 5 to 7 days of penetration). They then travel through the circulatory system to the heptoportal circulation (after 15 days) where they mature into adult worms and mate. Depending on the species, the schistosomes migrate to their final infection site either in the bladder venous system (_Schistosoma haematobium__ or the intestinal venous system (_S. mansoni_, _S. japanicum_, _S. intercalatum_) where the females begin egg production. These eggs are attached to the wall of colon or bladder from where they can be released into the lumen and are expelled in the feces or urine. The miracidium, liberated from the egg, seek out snail hosts where they enter a sporocyst stage that eventually results in free-living cercariae that seek out human hosts.\n\nGenital schistosomiasis, usually from _S. haematobium_, occurs when the worms pass through the plexus of veins draining from the urinary bladder to those interconnecting veins draining the male or female genital organs. Dr Kjetland and colleagues have published a good review on female genital schistosomiasis (1) and stress that genital lesions, not necessarily with viable eggs, which may cause loss of mucosal integrity, pathological vessel morphology and contact bleeding can be found even after the excretion of _S. haematobium_ eggs in the urine has stopped. Whether urinary schistosomiasis is an independent variable in the acquisition of HIV or not may be difficult to cull from the data but clearly genital schistosomiasis is an underreported disease requiring more attention. It can be found even in infants from exposure to contaminated fresh water that the child is bathed in (2).\n\nOf note, a recent article has been published describing a mouse model for female genital schistosomiasis which may help in sorting out the relationship of this disease and HIV (3).\n\nThe citation reported in the article above regarding the 3-fold risk of having HIV, with its abstract, is shown below:\nKjetland EF, Ndhlovu PD, Gomo E, et al: Association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV in rural Zimbabwean women. AIDS. 2006; 20(4): 593-600 (the full paper is available at http://tinyurl.com/l296uge).\n\n\"Design and methods: A cross-sectional study with a one-year follow-up. Gynecological and laboratory investigations were performed for _Schistosoma haematobium_ and HIV. Sexually transmitted infections, demographic, and urogenital history were analysed as confounders. The participants were 527 sexually active, non-pregnant, non-menopausal women between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The setting was a rural Zimbabwean community where _S. haematobium_ related lesions were found in 46 percent of the women, HIV in 29 percent and herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) in 65 percent.\n\nResults: In permanent residents (greater than 3 years residency), HIV was found in 41 percent (29/70) of women with laboratory proven genital schistosomiasis as opposed to 26 percent HIV positive (96/375) in the schistosomal ova negative group [odds ratio (OR), 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.5; P = 0.008. In multivariate analysis _S. haematobium_ infection of the genital mucosa was significantly associated with HIV seropositivity (adjusted OR, 2.9; 95 percent CI, 1.11-7.5; P = 0.030). All 7 women who became HIV positive during the study period (seroincidence 3.1 percent) had signs of _S. haematobium_ at baseline. In accordance with other studies HIV was significantly associated with HSV-2 (OR, 3.0; 95 percent CI, 1.7-5.3; P less than 0.001), syphilis and human papillomavirus. The highest HIV prevalence (45 percent) was found in the 25-29 years age group.\n\nConclusion: Women with genital schistosomiasis had an almost 3-fold risk of having HIV in this rural Zimbabwean community. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the association.\"\n\nReferences:\n1. Kjetland EF, Leutscher PDC, Ndhlovu PD: A review of female genital schistosomiasis.

Int J STD AIDS. 2014 Mar 12. [Epub ahead of print]). Women with genital schistosomiasis experience bleeding easily which increases transmission. Whether the same is seen in male genital schistosomiasis is much less documented, but it is likely that bleeding into the semen may increase transmission risk from the male to the female partner. - Mod.EP]\nSee Also\n2013\n----\nSchistosomiasis - Uganda: (KA) travelers, altitude 20131123.2070772\n2012\n----\nSchistosomiasis - Sudan: (KN) 20121227.1469487\n2011\n----\nSchistosomiasis - Uganda (02): (JI) comment 20110416.1198\nSchistosomiasis - Uganda: (JI) 20110413.1162\n2009\n----\nSchistosomiasis - Zambia 20090421.1507\n.................................................ll/mj/je/dk", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2361445", "archive_id": "2361445", "date": "2014-03-27 19:41:37", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Syphilis - Australia: (VI) increased incidence, MSM, HIV co-infection", "main_text": "SYPHILIS - AUSTRALIA: (VICTORIA) INCREASED INCIDENCE, MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, HIV CO-INFECTION\n*************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 25 Mar 2014\nSource: Star Observer [edited]\nhttp://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/victoria-news/dramatic-rise-in-syphilis-rates-in-victoria/120749\n\n\nSyphilis rates among men who have sex with men have risen dramatically in Victoria [Australia] over the past year, with a significant increase specifically in HIV-positive men.\n\nThe number of syphilis cases notified in 2013 was up 42 per cent on 2012 and 126 per cent on 2010, with a total of 663 reported cases. Around half of the reported cases were in HIV-positive men, and a significant proportion of those cases were re-infections.\n\nProfessor Kit Fairley from Alfred Health told the Star Observer despite the overall increase in syphilis rates the proportion of infections among HIV-positive men reflected the norm.\n\nA rise in syphilis rates is a particular public health concern due to its relationship to HIV transmission. A person with syphilis is more likely to both contract and transmit HIV, but Fairley said researchers were unclear of the exact reasons for this. \"We're not sure whether that relates to some differences in sexual practices or whether that relates to differences in immunity or susceptibility,\" Fairley said.\n\nSyphilis has been on the rise across Australia, but Victoria saw the largest increase last year [2013]. It has prompted Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Rosemary Lester to issue a health alert, encouraging all men who have sex with men (MSM) to get tested for the infection at least once a year. The alert also stated MSM with more than 10 partners in the past year should test for syphilis every 3 months, and HIV-positive MSM should be screened for syphilis as part of routine HIV monitoring.\n\nFairley told the Star Observer a focus on encouraging both clinicians and at-risk groups to test more often for syphilis was the best approach to curbing rising rates, given the difficulty of protecting against infection during sex.\n\n\"The thing about syphilis -- the same thing is true for gonorrhoea -- is it can be transmitted through non-anal sex. So oral sex or mutual masturbation or other stuff can transmit syphilis equally well. So if HIV-positive individuals are being safer, it doesn't actually help with syphilis,\" Fairley explained.\n\nSyphilis is a notifiable disease in Australia, meaning cases must be reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.\n\n[Byline: Benjamin Riley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Victoria, in southeastern Australia, is the country's most densely populated state and its 2nd-most populous state overall. Most of its population of over 5.7 million is concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, which includes the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Melbourne, which is Australia's 2nd-largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)).\n\nThe following has been extracted from Annual reports -- Australia's notifiable disease status, 2010: Annual report of the national notifiable diseases surveillance system [NNDSS]. NNDSS Annual Report Writing Group. Communicable Diseases Intelligence; 36(1). Quarterly report March 2012; available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-cdi3601-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3601.pdf.\n\nThe rate of early syphilis (less than 2 years duration) notifications increased from 3.2 per 100 000 in 2005 to a peak of 6.7 per 100 000 in 2007 and has been gradually declining since then to 4.9 per 100 000 in 2010. Over the period 2005 to 2007, notification rates amongst males increased substantially, in the 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 year age groups but since then have either decreased or remained relatively stable. While national rates have declined since 2007 overall, the increase in men between 2005 and 2010 has, as in other developed countries, predominantly affected men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nIn 2010, nationally the rates of early syphilis for males and females were 8.9 and 1.0 per 100 000 population respectively, representing a male to female ratio of 9:1. In Victoria in 2010, the overall rate was 5.2 (291 cases) with a rate in males of 9.6 (264 cases) versus 0.9 (26 cases) in females.\n\nReported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in syphilis have been attributed in part to \"HIV prevention fatigue\" -- that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/288.]\nSee Also\nSyphilis - USA (04): (NY) increased incidence, MSM, mobile phone apps 20140312.2327516\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - USA (03): (ND) increased incidence 20140301.2308371\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - USA (02): (ND) increased incidence 20140227.2303196\nSyphilis - USA (03): (MO, KS) higher incidence, antibiotic resistance 20140216.2281656\nSyphilis - UK: (Scotland) 20140209.2265758\nSyphilis - USA (02): (SC) 2012, increased incidence 20140126.2232006\nSyphilis - USA: (SD) increased incidence, RFI 20140122.2223553\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - USA: increased incidence 20140109.2162074\n2013\n----\nSyphilis & gonococcal disease - USA: (OR) increased incidence 20131225.2135525\nSyphilis - USA (08): (NV) increased incidence 20131218.2122331\nSyphilis - Canada (04): (NU) increased cases, RFI 20131207.2098056\nSyphilis - UK: (Scotland) young heterosexuals 20131205.2094184\nSyphilis - USA (07): (OK) higher incidence, comment 20131108.2045298\nSyphilis - USA (06): (OK) higher incidence 20131103.2036439\nSyphilis - USA (05): (FL) higher incidence 20130922.1960607\nSyphilis - USA (04): (MO) higher incidence, young men, urban 20130818.1887009\nSyphilis - USA (03): (TX) congenital, rising incidence 20130818.1886533\nSyphilis - USA (02): (MI) increased incidence, MSM, urban 20130708.1811814\nSyphilis - Canada (03): (BC) increased incidence, MSM, urban 20130608.1761566\nSyphilis - USA: (CA) MSM, RFI 20130522.1730900\nSyphilis - Canada (02): (NS) MSM, mobile phone apps 20130320.1594646\nSyphilis - New Zealand: (CA) MSM 20130309.1579043\nSyphilis - Canada: (NU) RFI 20130214.1542486\n2012\n---\nSyphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631\nSyphilis - Australia (02): (QL) increased incidence, RFI 20120510.1128901\nSyphilis - Australia: (QL) 20120215.1042038\nSyphilis - Canada (02): background 20120211.1038978\nSyphilis - Canada: (NB) 20120210.1038543\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/ml", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2333869", "archive_id": "2333869", "date": "2014-03-14 17:32:55", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - USA: (TX) transmission, WSW, 2012", "main_text": "HIV - USA: (TEXAS) TRANSMISSION, WOMEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH WOMEN, 2012\n********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 14 Mar 2014\nSource: CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Weekly 63(10);209-212 (MMWR) [edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6310a1.htm?s_cid=mm6310a1_e\n\n\nLikely Female-to-Female Sexual Transmission of HIV -- Texas, 2012\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nIn August 2012, the Houston Department of Health contacted CDC regarding the rare transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) likely by sexual contact between 2 women. The case was investigated, and laboratory testing confirmed that the woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection had a virus virtually identical to that of her female partner, who was diagnosed previously with HIV and who had stopped receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2010. This report describes this case of HIV infection, likely acquired by female-to-female sexual transmission during the 6-month monogamous relationship of the HIV-discordant couple (one negative, one positive). The woman with newly acquired infection did not report any other recognized risk factors for HIV infection, and the viruses infecting the 2 women had at least 98 percent sequence identity in 3 genes. The couple had not received any preventive counseling before acquisition of the virus by the woman who had tested negative for HIV. HIV-discordant couples should receive counseling regarding safer sex practices, and HIV-infected partners should be linked to and retained in medical care.\n\nTransmission of HIV between women who have sex with women (WSW) has been reported rarely and is difficult to ascertain. The potential for HIV transmission by female-to-female sexual contact includes unprotected exposure to vaginal or other body fluids and to blood from menstruation, or to exposure to blood from trauma during rough sex. Other potential exposures associated with HIV transmission in WSW that must be ruled out include injection drug use (IDU), heterosexual sex, tattooing, acupuncture, piercing, use of shared sex toys between the partners and other persons, exposure to body fluids of others, and receipt of transplants or transfusion.\n\nEpidemiologic Findings\n----------------------\nThe woman who acquired HIV was aged 46 years and had a history of heterosexual intercourse, but not in the 10 years before HIV infection. She reported 3 female sexual partners in the preceding 5 years but said she had no IDU, receipt of tattoos, acupuncture, transfusions, transplants, or any other recognized HIV risk behavior. The woman supplemented her income by selling her plasma and had tested negative for HIV by HIV-1/2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) serology screening after donating plasma in March 2012.\n\nIn April [2012], 10 days after donating plasma, the woman went to an emergency department with a sore throat, fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, pain on swallowing, dry cough, frequent diarrhea, and muscle cramps. At that time, she was again tested for HIV by EIA serology screening, and the results were negative. She was treated with azithromycin for a presumed upper respiratory infection and discharged. Then, 18 days later, the woman attempted to sell plasma but was refused because she tested positive for HIV by EIA serology screening followed by an HIV-1 Western blot test. On [5 Jul 2012], results of repeated EIA and Western blot tests conducted on the woman at a health clinic were positive for HIV infection.\n\nThe likely source of the patient's new HIV infection was her female sex partner aged 43 years who had tested positive for HIV in September 2008 when she had an HIV-1 viral load of 82 000 copies/mL and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 372 cells/mm3 (25 percent). The partner began antiretroviral treatment in February 2009 but stopped in November 2010. Although she had esophageal candidiasis and weight loss at the time of her HIV diagnosis, her HIV-1 viral load had decreased to 178 copies/mL, and her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had increased to 554 cells/mm3 (44 percent) by January 2011, when she was lost to follow-up.\n\nThe couple reported routinely having unprotected (using no barrier precautions) oral and vaginal contact and using insertive sex toys that were shared between them but were not shared with any other persons. They described their sexual contact as at times rough to the point of inducing bleeding in either woman. They also reported having unprotected sexual contact during the menses of either partner. The recently infected woman reported that her partner was her only sexual contact during the 6 months before her seroconversion.\n\nPhylogenetic Analyses\n---------------------\nOn [10 Sep 2012], the newly infected woman tested positive for HIV by HIV-1/2/O EIA, and her HIV-1 Western blot was positive for all bands. Her Multispot test was reactive to HIV-1 only, and she had an HIV-1 viral load of 23 600 copies/mL. The partner's blood tested positive by HIV-1/2/O EIA, and her HIV-1 Western blot was positive for all bands. Her Multispot test was reactive to HIV-1 only, and she had a HIV-1 viral load of 69 000 copies/mL. HIV-1 polymerase (pol), group antigen (gag), and envelope (env) sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from specimens from both women. Phylogenetic analyses of the pol and env sequences revealed that both women had highly related sequences with pairwise nucleotide identity of 98.7 percent in gag and 98.0 percent in both env and pol. Neither pol sequence had any major drug resistance mutations but shared the following polymorphisms: protease (M36I, R41K, and L63T) and reverse transcriptase (R83K, K122E, I178L, and R211K).\n\nMMWR Editorial Note\n--------------\nThis report describes a case of HIV transmission likely by sexual contact between female partners. Past confirmation of HIV transmission during female-to-female sexual contact has been difficult because other risk factors almost always are present or cannot be ruled out. In this case, other risk factors for HIV transmission were not reported by the newly infected woman, and the viruses infecting the 2 women were virtually identical.\n\nFew previous reports describe HIV transmission between WSW. One case involved a woman diagnosed in the Philippines who reported sexual contact exclusively with women and said she did not use injection drugs; however, no source of transmission was confirmed (1). Another instance of HIV transmission between WSW was reported for a woman aged 20 years with no other risk behaviors who said she had a 2-year relationship and unprotected intercourse with a female partner known to be HIV-infected (2). The woman and her partner had identical HIV-1 drug resistance mutations, but no phylogenetic linkage testing was conducted.\n\nMore commonly, HIV infections in WSW have been attributed to risk behaviors such as IDU or to concomitant heterosexual sex. A study of 18 HIV-discordant WSW couples followed for 3-6 months found no evidence of transmission, leading the authors to suggest that no risk for HIV transmission might exist in exclusive WSW couples (3). The same authors described the cases of 11 HIV-positive WSW and found that 10 used injection drugs and 2 provided a history of sexual activity with both men and women (4). In a cohort of 511 women with a history of female-to-female sexual contact, 470 (92 percent) reported having sex with both men and women, and 41 (8 percent) were WSW only; 13 women were found to have HIV infection, but none were categorized as WSW only (5).\n\nTo document female-to-female sexual contact in women who were HIV-positive, a survey of 960 000 female blood donors was conducted; of 144 women who tested positive for HIV infection, 106 were interviewed. Of these 106 women, 102 were heterosexual, 3 had a history of sex with both men and women, 1 reported having had sex with a person with a history of IDU whose sex was not given, and 3 women had a history of IDU. None of the 106 women reported female-to-female sexual contact as their only risk behavior (6). In another large survey conducted during 1986-1989, a total of 1014 female patients in a clinic were interviewed, and 101 (10 percent) reported female-to-female sexual contact. Of the 101 WSW, 90 percent provided a history of sex with both men and women, and 37 percent reported IDU history. All 13 women who tested HIV-positive and reported female-to-female sexual contact also provided a history of sexual contact with men, and 12 reported IDU history (7).\n\nA series of reports by CDC authors did not confirm HIV transmission by female-to-female sexual contact alone. In a 1990 report, among 79 women who were HIV-positive and had female-to-female sexual contact history only, 75 also had a history of IDU, and the remaining 4 had received transfusions (8). In a 1992 report, a total of 18 199 women with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from the period 1980-1991 were examined; 164 of these women provided a history of female-to-female sexual contact. Of the 164, a total of 152 (93 percent) provided an additional history of IDU, and 12 (7 percent) had received blood before 1985 (9). In a 1994 report, of 1122 women found to be HIV-positive, 65 (5.8 percent) had a history of female-to-female sexual contact. Of the 65, a total of 55 (85 percent) also had a history of sexual contact with men; 28 of the women with a history of sexual contact with both men and women also reported IDU. Of the 10 remaining women with exclusive female-to-female sexual contact, 8 reported IDU, 1 had received a blood transfusion, and 1 was reported as having no other identified risk behavior (10).\n\nThis report describes likely female-to-female transmission of HIV-1 supported by phylogenetic analysis in a WSW couple who had unprotected sex during a 6-month monogamous relationship. Although rare, HIV transmission between WSW can occur. All persons at risk for HIV, including all discordant couples, should receive information regarding the prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections to prevent the HIV-negative partner from acquiring the infection. Furthermore, all persons identified as infected with HIV should be linked to and retained in medical care. Control of HIV infection with suppression of viral load can result in better health outcomes and a reduced chance of transmitting HIV to partners.\n\n[References are available at the source URL.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the United States, HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus) is mainly spread person-to-person by having unprotected sex (sex without a condom) with someone infected with infected with the HIV. Other modes of transmission include intravenous drug use, tattooing, blood transfusion, organ or tissue transplantation, acupuncture. Women who have sex with women (WSW) have been found to often be exposed to traditionally recognized modes of transmission, such as intravenous drug use and heterosexual intercourse, which are then presumed to be their mode of acquisition of HIV infection (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=377462).\n\nHIV can be found in vaginal fluid and blood. Unprotected exposure to vaginal or other body fluids such as blood from menstruation or blood from trauma during rough sex can be a mode of transmission. In 2003, a case of female-to-female transmission of HIV was described in a woman with no obvious risk factors, and the genotype of the infecting strain closely matched that of the strain infecting her bisexual female partner. The route of transmission in this case was thought to be use of sex toys, used vigorously enough to cause exchange of blood-tinged body fluids (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/3/e40.full).\n\nThe case described in the MMWR report above similarly had no history of modes of transmission that could have exposed her to HIV, other than unprotected sex during a 6-month monogamous relationship with an HIV-positive woman, which exposed her to blood and body fluids from her HIV-infected female sex partner. In addition, DNA sequences of HIV from each woman were almost identical.\n\nAlthough HIV transmission is apparently rare among discordant lesbian couples, i.e., when one partner is HIV-positive and the other is negative, the MMWR report above emphasizes counseling WSW with regard to the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and treatment of the HIV-positive partner to reduce to viral load. Treating HIV-infected people with antiretrovirals significantly reduces transmission to partners (http://www.nih.gov/news/health/may2011/niaid-12.htm). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.]\nSee Also\n2013\n----\nHIV - Japan: blood donation risk 20131201.2085239\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (05): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130920.1958804\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (04): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130607.1760955\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (03): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130504.1691297\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130420.1660335\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (OK), possible dental exposure, alert 20130329.1609886\n2012\n----\nHepatitis A & C, HIV - USA: (CO) dental exposure 20120805.1229456\nHIV - Kyrgyzstan (02): nosocomial, children 20120214.1041628\nHIV - Kyrgyzstan: nosocomial transmission, children 20120211.1039333\nHIV - USA: (MI) malicious intent 20120102.0011\n2011\n----\nHIV - Indonesia: (BA) tattooing susp. 20111227.3686\nHIV - India: (GJ), children, blood transfusion 20110917.2832\nHIV, organ transplantation - Taiwan 20110828.2640\nHIV, organ transplantation - USA: (NY) 20110318.0868\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA (02): (CA) 20110114.0162\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA: (CA) alert 20110112.0139\n2010\n----\nHIV, HBV & HCV, injecting drug users - UK 20101106.4027\nHIV & hepatitis C, blood transfusion - India: (RJ) 20100714.2358\n.................................................mpp/ml/je/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2330501", "archive_id": "2330501", "date": "2014-03-14 11:37:13", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (NY) possible insulin syringe exposure", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B AND C, HIV - USA: (NEW YORK) POSSIBLE INSULIN SYRINGE EXPOSURE\n**************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 11 Mar 2014\nSource: Newsday (NY) [edited]\nhttp://www.newsday.com/news/health/south-nassau-hospital-alerting-4-247-patients-of-possible-blood-contamination-1.7359969\n\n\nSouth Nassau Communities Hospital [Nassau County on Long Island] is sending out 4247 letters to patients recommending they be tested for hepatitis B and C and HIV because of the risk of infection from an insulin pen. In the letter dated 22 Feb 2014, the Oceanside hospital said the patients may have received insulin from an insulin pen reservoir, not the pen's single-use disposable needle, which could have been used with more than one patient.\n\nAn insulin pen for those with diabetes is a pre-filled syringe meant to be used to dispense insulin in a single patient. Because of potential backflow of a patient's blood into the pen cartridge after injection, using a pen on multiple patients may expose them to blood-borne infections.\n\nHospital spokesman Damian Becker said no one was observed reusing the insulin pen reservoir on more than one patient, but a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so. \"Once that was said, we then followed through with a report to the state Department of Health,\" Becker said. The hospital said risk of infection is \"extremely low.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. While the testing is voluntary, it is recommended,\" the hospital said.\n\nBecker said Tuesday [11 Mar 2014], the hospital, which is sending the letters out in phases, has received about 200 phone calls so far. The last letters should be received by 17 Mar 2014, Becker said. It will take patients about 2 weeks to receive test results, he said.\n\nThe hospital said it has since banned the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use vials.\n\nThe state Department of Health said that in 2013, 3 health facilities reported potential insulin pen re-use: 2 state-regulated facilities and the Veterans Administration's medical center in Buffalo.\n\nIn May 2008, Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, NY notified 840 patients that nurses may have been using insulin pens on multiple patients. In 2009, following reports of improper use of insulin pens in hospitals, the FDA issued an alert reminding health care workers that insulin pens are meant for use on a single patient only. In 2012, CDC said that \"in spite of this alert, there have been continuing reports of patients placed at risk through inappropriate reuse and sharing of insulin pens,\" and it put out a clinical reminder on their proper use.\n\nIn 2013, the VA issued an alert systemwide following the report of insulin pen misuse at its Buffalo hospital. Of 395 patients tested, 12 were found with hepatitis B and 6 with hepatitis C [although there was no direct evidence that the insulin pen exposure was the source of the infections. - Mod.LL]\n\n[Byline: Ridgely Ochs]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Despite multiple potential episodes and warnings from both the FDA and CDC, nosocomial episodes such as this one on Long Island seem to continue to occur.

The ministry's Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council will discuss steps to be taken at a panel on blood product operations.\n\nIt is the 1st time that blood from a donor infected with HIV was found to have been transfused to patients [in Japan] since the Japanese Red Cross Society reinforced its checking systems in 2004, after a case of HIV infection through blood transfusion was found the previous year. According to the ministry and the Japanese Red Cross Society, HIV antibodies were detected in blood that was donated earlier this month [November 2013]. Although that blood was not used for transfusion, it was found that the same donor had also given blood in February this year [2013].\n\nThe society checked a stored sample from the earlier donation, and HIV genes were detected. The society also confirmed that the blood, given by an unnamed man, was transfused to 2 patients at 2 different medical institutions.\n\nThe Japanese Red Cross Society said the man wrote untrue answers on a 23-point checklist at the time of his recent donation, including a question about whether he was making the donation to receive an HIV test because he was worried about AIDS. The ministry's position is that the man possibly donated blood aiming to check whether he was infected with AIDS.\n\nThe checks are conducted in 2 stages. 1st, each blood sample undergoes tests to detect antibodies of viruses. Since 1999, this has been followed by higher-accuracy tests conducted on groups of 20 samples. If any group is found to contain a sample that is HIV-positive, all the samples are checked in more detail to pinpoint the donor in question. The blood that was transfused to the 2 patients this year [2013] was not found to be HIV-positive when it was checked in February 2013. However, this may be due to the fact that HIV infection has an initial stage called a window period, during which HIV viruses cannot be detected, because there is such a small amount of them in the blood.\n\nThe test the Japanese Red Cross Society introduced in 1999 is called the nucleic acid amplification test (NAT), which multiplies the number of virus genes in a sample to more accurately detect their existence. But in 2003, a quantity of donated blood passed through the NAT check and was transfused to a patient, who was later found to be infected with HIV.\n\nTo further improve the accuracy of the checks, the Japanese Red Cross Society tightened procedures in 2004. The NAT tests, which had been conducted on samples from groups of 50 donors, are now conducted on samples from groups of 20. The society is considering further reducing the number in the group checks. \"We want to shorten the period during which viruses cannot be detected as far as possible,\" an official of the society said.\n\nHealth, Labor and Welfare Minister Norihisa Tamura said at a press conference Tuesday [26 Nov 2013] morning after a Cabinet meeting: \"I want to consider an option that [samples] of each donor will be checked [individually rather than in groups].\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Screening of HIV-contaminated blood for transfusion is a continuing problem, and in the Japanese experience, there may be no sure alternative to the screening of individual donations. Information on the final procedure adopted by the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross would be appreciated. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/62Cn.]\nSee Also\n2011\n----\nHIV - India: (GJ), children, blood transfusion 20110917.2832\n2010\n----\nHIV & hepatitis C, blood transfusion - India: (RJ) 20100714.2358\n2007\n----\nHIV, blood transfusion - Peru 20070914.3048\n2006\n----\nHIV, blood transfusion risk - India (02) 20061109.3217\nHIV, blood transfusion risk - India 20061105.3174\n2003\n----\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan (02) 20031003.2492\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan 20031002.2475\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan (02) 20030821.2098\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan 20030730.1871\n.................................................sb/cp/msp/jw", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2082684", "archive_id": "2082684", "date": "2013-11-30 11:41:09", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - Guinea-Bissau: new aggressive variant", "main_text": "HIV - GUINEA-BISSAU: NEW AGGRESSIVE VARIANT\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Fri 29 Nov 2013\nSource: Fox News [edited]\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/11/29/new-aggressive-strain-hiv-discovered/\n\n\nResearchers have discovered a new, more aggressive strain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that develops into AIDS much more quickly than other strains, Medical News Today reported. In a new study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, scientists detailed the new strain as a \"recombinant\" virus -- a hybrid of 2 virus strains. Called A3/02 -- a cross between the 02AG and A3 viruses -- the strain can develop into AIDS in just 5 years after 1st infection -- one of the shortest time periods for HIV-1 types.\n\n\"Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they [originated],\" said 1st author Angelica Palm, a doctoral candidate at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nSo far, the A3/02 strain has only been seen in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, but other studies have shown that recombinants are spreading more quickly across the globe. \"HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing,\" said senior author Patrik Medstran, professor of clinical virology at Lund University. \"We therefore need to be aware of how the HIV-1 epidemic changes over time.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 9 Aug 2013\nSource: The publication referred to in the above press report is entitled: Faster Progression to AIDS and AIDS-Related Death Among Seroincident Individuals Infected with Recombinant HIV-1 A3/CRF02_AG Compared with Sub-subtype A3. By Angelica A. Palm and 9 others, in J Infect Dis. (2013):10.1093/infdis/jit416. [edited]\n\n\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is divided into subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) but the impact of subtype/CRF on disease progression is not fully understood.\n\nMethods: We determined the HIV-1 subtype/CRF of 152 seroincident individuals from Guinea-Bissau, based on the C2-V3 region of _env_. Disease progression was measured as time from estimated seroconversion to AIDS and AIDS-related death. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for gender and age at seroconversion.\n\nResults: The major subtypes/CRFs identified were CRF02_AG (53 percent), A3 (29 percent), and A3/02 (a recombinant of A3 and CRF02_AG) (13 percent). Infection with A3/02 was associated with a close to 3-fold increased risk of AIDS and AIDS-related death compared to A3 (HR = 2.6 [P = 0.011] and 2.9 [P= 0.032], respectively). The estimated time from seroconversion to AIDS and AIDS-related death was 5.0 and 8.0 years for A3/02, 6.2 and 9.0 years for CRF02_AG, and 7.2 and 11.3 years for A3.\n\nConclusion: Our results show that there are differences in disease progression between HIV-1 A-like subtypes/CRFs. Individuals infected with A3/02 have among the fastest progression rates to AIDS reported to date. Determining the HIV-1 subtype of infected individuals could be important in the management of HIV-1 infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It remains to be seen whether this new recombinant, exhibiting enhanced disease progression, will remain confined to Guinea-Bissau or will spread beyond its present bounds. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1KlQ.]\nSee Also\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (05): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130920.1958804\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (04): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130607.1760955\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (03): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130504.1691297\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130420.1660335\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (OK), possible dental exposure, alert 20130329.1609886\n.................................................cp/je/jw", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1958804", "archive_id": "1958804", "date": "2013-09-20 17:34:48", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (05): (OK) possible dental exposure", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B & C, HIV - USA (05): (OKLAHOMA) POSSIBLE DENTAL EXPOSURE\n********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 19 Sep 2013\nSource: KCEN TV [edited]\nhttp://www.kcentv.com/story/23474664/oklahoma-dentist-responsible-for-hep-c-outbreak\n\n\nA Tulsa, Oklahoma, dentist is responsible for the nation's 1st transmission of hepatitis C between patients in a dental office.

On 28 Mar 2013, public health officials announced they were notifying current and former patients of the practice that they may have been exposed to bloodborne viruses at Harrington's Tulsa and Owasso offices and urged them to be tested.\n\nThe Oklahoma State Department of Health's Public Health Laboratory completed the testing for 3122 people; 3235 people as of 18 Apr 2013 had visited county health departments to have blood drawn for testing, and an unknown number of others have sought testing through private health care providers, the statement says. It says that based on current Oklahoma disease prevalence data for hepatitis B and C and HIV, health officials know some of the positives probably resulted from infection exposure not related to the Harrington practice. The most recent data available indicates an estimated 4944 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Oklahoma and as many as 68 000 Oklahomans may be infected with hepatitis C.\n\n\"We understand these 1st reported test results may be of concern,\" said THD Director Dr. Bruce Dart. \"Thorough investigations are routinely conducted upon notification of a positive report for these infections. This response will be handled in the same manner, as disease investigation is a core public health service, and staff are well trained to conduct this type of response.\"\n\nThe departments are notifying people who participated in the screening of their test results; those with positive tests are being personally contacted and counseled and will be directed to resources for appropriate care and follow-up. If warranted, testing will be recommended for a spouse or partner.\n\n\"This is a complex investigation,\" State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. \"The next phase will include more in-depth interviews of persons who test positive to determine the likelihood that their exposure is associated with their dental surgical procedure at the Harrington practice. We will certainly continue to keep the public informed as we learn more.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previously, it was reported that some 7000 patients who since 2007 received treatment at a dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma will begin to receive letters recommending that they be tested for the presence of the blood-borne pathogens hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The investigation revealed practices that could have exposed patients to infectious material.\n\nAccording to the OSD, the investigation of the practice of W. Scott Harrington, D.M.D. so far has found numerous violations of health and safety laws and major violations of the State Dental Act. Dental Board investigators have been assisted by agents from the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration concerning the maintenance, control and use of drugs on the premises. The dentist and dental office voluntarily discontinued practicing upon the beginning of the investigation. The dentist is cooperating with investigators through his attorney. The State Board of Dentistry has been working very closely with the State Health Department on this investigation. The investigation is multifaceted and ongoing.\n\nPatients who had procedures at Dr. W. Scott Harrington's dental practice, located at 2111 S. Atlanta Place in Tulsa or at 12806 E. 86th Place N. in Owasso, Oklahoma, will begin to receive letters in the mail. The notification includes patients who have visited Dr. Harrington since 2007 and recommends they be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV are serious medical conditions, and infected patients may not have outward symptoms of these diseases for many years. As a precaution, and in order to take appropriate steps to protect their health, it is important for these patients to get tested. It should be noted that transmission in this type of occupational setting is rare.\n\nAll testing will be done free of charge at the Tulsa Health Department's North Regional Health and Wellness Center located at 5635 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Services will be provided on a walk-in basis starting on Sat 30 Mar 2013 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and will resume on Mon 1 Apr 2013 from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In addition, the health department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions about this notification or hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Patient information was only available from the past 7 years; therefore, patients who were seen by Dr. Harrington prior to 2007 may not receive a letter. Anyone with additional questions may call the hotline.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department will continue to provide updated information on their website at http://www.tulsa-health.org.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 28 Mar 2013\nSource: ABC News [edited]\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Health/rogue-dentist-exposed-7000-patients-hiv-hepatitis/story?id=18834611#.UVUE0Vf4KSo\n\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department is warning 7000 patients of a local dentist's office that they could have contracted HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C from poor sterilization practices. Dr. Wayne Harrington, an oral surgeon with a practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is being investigated by the state dental board, the state bureau of narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Agency because one of his patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than receiving dental treatment.\n\nUpon hearing of the infected patient, the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry conducted a surprise inspection of Harrington's practice on 18 Mar 2013, allegedly finding numerous problems, including regular use of a rusty set of instruments on patients with known infections, and the practice of pouring bleach on wounds until they \"turned white.\"\n\nCalls to Harrington's office were directed to an operator, who told ABC News the clinic no longer took voice-mails. The operator said patients were being referred to another clinic but did not disclose the clinic's name.\n\nSusan Rogers, executive director of Oklahoma's Board of Dentistry, called the incident a \"perfect storm.\" On top of his many violations in sanitary practice, the dentist was a Medicaid provider, which means he had a high proportion of patients with HIV or hepatitis, she said. Harrington and his staff told investigators that he treated a \"high population of known infectious disease carrier patients,\" according to a complaint filed by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. He allegedly allowed unlicensed dental assistants to administer medication, according to the complaint. These assistants were left to decide which medications to administer and how much was appropriate. Drug cabinets were unlocked and unsupervised during the day, and Harrington did not keep an inventory log of drugs, some of which were controlled substances. One drug vial had expired in 1993.\n\n\"During the inspections, Dr. Harrington referred to his staff regarding all sterilization and drug procedures in his office,\" the complaint read. \"He advised, 'They take care of that. I don't.'\"\n\nHarrington allegedly re-used needles, contaminating drugs with potentially harmful bacteria and trace amounts of other drugs, according to the complaint. Although patient-specific drug records indicated that they were using morphine in 2012, no morphine had been ordered since 2009. The instruments for infected patients were given an extra dip in bleach in addition to normal cleaning methods, but they had red-brown rust spots, indicating that they were \"porous and cannot be properly sterilized,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department said Harrington's patients will receive letters by mail notifying them of the risk and steps to obtain free-of-charge testing. While 7000 patients may have been exposed, Joseph Perz, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it's \"extremely rare\" to see dental transmission of HIV and hepatitis B or C. In July 2012, 8000 persons in Colorado were notified that their dentist had reused needles, potentially exposing them to the blood-borne viruses. But not a single case was identified, according to the CDC. Dental transmission is not impossible, however. Perz cited a dental fair 3 years ago in which hepatitis B was transmitted between patients. In July 2012, more than 1800 veterans who received dental care at a St. Louis VA Medical Center were warned that improper cleaning of dental tools may have exposed them to HIV and hepatitis.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Lupkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Some 7000 patients who since 2007 received treatment at a dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma will begin to receive letters recommending that they be tested for the presence of the blood-borne pathogens hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Figures released today [17 Oct 2012] show that the number of new diagnoses increased by 8 per cent last year [2011] and by 50 per cent during the past 10 years. David Wilson, the head of the Kirby Institute's surveillance and evaluation program for public health at the University of New South Wales (NSW), said NSW, Victoria, and the Australia Capital Territory (ACT) had driven the increase. \"In these 3 states, we have seen quite a significant rise in the last calendar year,\" he said.\n\nVictoria experienced the biggest increase, but in NSW, more people were being picked up with HIV [infection] they had contracted only recently, as opposed to being picked up only after the condition had progressed. Associate Professor Wilson said it was unusual for infectious diseases such as HIV [infection] to increase after they had been controlled, but the lowest levels of HIV diagnosis in Australia were 10 years ago. \"We thought we had at least reached a plateau about 5 years ago, but we have not,\" he said.\n\nAbout 24 000 to 25 000 Australians live with diagnosed HIV [infection], but up to 10 000 might not have been diagnosed, he said. The most recent increase in the number of new HIV cases diagnosed -- from 1051 in 2010 to 1137 in 2011 -- has been driven by increases among gay men, although in the past 10 years, there have been rises in other groups.\n\nJohn de Wit, the Director of the National Centre in HIV Social Research at the University of NSW, said research indicated a small increase in unprotected sex among gay men, with more than 1/3rd reporting unprotected sex with a casual partner in the past 6 months. But this increase probably did not explain the entire rise in diagnoses, and nor did increases in testing.\n\nExperts attending the Australasian HIV/AIDS Conference today [17 Oct 2012] will launch a plan, the Melbourne Declaration, in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. The president of the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine, Edwina Wright, said the declaration included calls to remove restrictions on funding for medications for people in the early stages of the disease and speed up the approval of antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of HIV in people exposed to it.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, Rob Lake, said the increase in diagnoses was a call to action. He said Australia must urgently introduce rapid HIV testing, for which a licence had not yet been granted. Rapid testing gives a result within an hour rather than a week, and so reduced the time people were unaware of their infection, he said. HIV rates in Australia skyrocketed in the late 1980s, increasing from 400 new cases in 1984 to a peak of nearly 2400 new cases in 1987, after which numbers declined for more than 10 years. But at the turn of the century, the number of new infections started to creep up each year, although HIV experts had believed the fairly steady numbers during the past 5 years indicated there would be no further increases.\n\n[Byline: Amy Corderoy]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[No explanation is offered to explain the increased prevalence of HIV infection in the 3 Australian states of ACT, NSW and VIC, other than it may reflect behavioural changes such as the contemporaneous increase in unprotected sex among gay men. An alternative explanation might be that the increased diagnosis of HIV infection is a consequence of greater awareness of the value of early treatment of HIV infection.\n\nA map showing the locations of the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria can be accessed at: http://mapsof.net/map/australia-states-rs01. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1z_*.]\nSee Also\n2009\n----\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - Australia: (QL) alert, corr. 20091117.3973\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - Australia: (QL) alert 20091117.3967\n.................................................sb/cp/msp/mpp", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1317973", "archive_id": "1317973", "date": "2012-10-01 12:47:38", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Salmonellosis, serotype Typhimurium - Africa: invasive strain, HIV", "main_text": "SALMONELLOSIS, SEROTYPE TYPHIMURIUM - AFRICA: INVASIVE STRAIN, HIV\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 30 Sep 2012\nSource: BBC News [edited]\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19727630\n\n\nAn epidemic of a deadly strain of _Salmonella_ has swept across the whole of Africa by \"taking advantage\" of the spread of HIV, according to an international team of researchers. Their study, published in Nature Genetics, is the 1st to identify the separate cases as a single epidemic. 1 in 4 people in Africa infected with the strain died.\n\nIt is thought to be the 1st time a single strain of an infection has spread so widely in the wake of HIV. Cases of this form of invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis have been recognized in Africa for more than a decade. It causes fever, headaches, respiratory problems, and sometimes death.\n\nThe research team analyzed the genetic code of 179 strains of the serotype from different parts of Africa and the rest of the globe. Using techniques similar to a large-scale DNA paternity test, they were able to construct the strain's \"family tree\" and then how it spread. It happened in 2 waves. The 1st started in south eastern Africa about 52 years ago and the 2nd wave started 35 years ago from the Congo Basin.\n\nProf Gordon Dougan, from the Sanger Institute in Cambridge in the UK, told the BBC: \"It quite clearly parallels the emergence of HIV in Africa.\" HIV attacks the immune system and leaves people more vulnerable to other infections. It is thought the strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium took advantage of this weakness and spread. The research team said the bacterium was given the chance to \"enter, adapt, circulate and thrive.\"\n\nThere is poor monitoring data for the disease across the whole of the continent, but Prof Dougan said it was affecting \"thousands and thousands\" of people and that 98 percent of adult cases were in people with HIV.\n\nProf Brendan Wren, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said this spread of _S._ Typhimurium had been different to that of other infections commonly associated with HIV, as it had been a single epidemic \"people were completely unaware\" of and there \"were not really any other examples\" of that happening.\n\nDr Melita Gordon, a gastroenterologist at the University of Liverpool, said: \"It's the 1st time this has been described right across a continent in such an obvious way.\" She added, \"The highest mortality associated with the disease is 80 percent. What's happened over the years is mortality has fallen down and down and down to between 20 percent and 25 percent as doctors inside Africa recognise it.\"\n\nThe genetic analysis also showed the strain was resistant to the 1st choice antibiotic, chloramphenicol, which means more expensive drugs would be needed to treat the infection.\n\nIt is thought that improving HIV treatment across Africa could reduce the prevalence of the _Salmonella_ infection, as it would reduce the number of people with vulnerable immune systems. However, the researchers urged \"vigilance\" in case the _Salmonella_ strain mutated again to become able to infect people with healthy immune systems.\n\nCommenting on the study, Prof Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: \"It's actually quite a huge problem and it seems to be getting worse because there are many susceptible people, it's got a grip in Africa. HIV, I think it's fair to say, provided a springboard for it to take off.\" However, he thought the disease was \"near its peak\" as HIV was more controlled in other continents giving it little room to spread.\n\n[Byline: James Gallagher]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Thomas James Allen for also contributing the information.\n\nThe citation of the paper, published yesterday [30 Sep 2012] electronically, is Okoro CK, Kingsley RA, Connor TR, Harris SR, et al: Intracontinental spread of human invasive _Salmonella_ Typhimurium pathovariants in sub-Saharan Africa. Nature Genetics, doi:10.1038/ng.2423. It's abstract is shown below:\n\n\"A highly invasive form of non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ (iNTS) disease has recently been documented in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common _Salmonella enterica_ serovar causing this disease is Typhimurium (_Salmonella_ Typhimurium). We applied whole-genome sequence-based phylogenetic methods to define the population structure of sub-Saharan African invasive _S._ Typhimurium isolates and compared these to global _S._ Typhimurium populations.\n\nNotably, the vast majority of sub-Saharan invasive _S._ Typhimurium isolates fell within 2 closely related, highly clustered phylogenetic lineages that we estimate emerged independently about 52 and about 35 years ago in close temporal association with the current HIV pandemic. Clonal replacement of isolates from lineage I by those from lineage II was potentially influenced by the use of chloramphenicol for the treatment of iNTS disease.\n\nOur analysis suggests that iNTS disease is in part an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa caused by highly related _S._ Typhimurium lineages that may have occupied new niches associated with a compromised human population and antibiotic treatment.\"\n\nOne clinical observation regarding this remarkable epidemic is that, in this cohort of patients, the presentation is distinct from those both of gastroenteritis due to salmonellosis and from typhoid fever. The illness tends to be characterized by a nonspecific fever that can be indistinguishable from malaria and only in rare cases is accompanied by diarrhea. In some parts of Africa, this invasive salmonellosis has surpassed _S._ Typhi as the dominant cause of invasive disease due to salmonellosis. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/2r-O.]\n\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/dk", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1259574", "archive_id": "1259574", "date": "2012-08-23 18:21:18", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome - Asian patients: not HIV", "main_text": "ADULT-ONSET IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME - ASIAN PATIENTS: NOT HIV\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 22 Aug 2012\nSource: Associated Press [edited]\nhttp://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MED_MYSTERY_DISEASE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-08-22-18-04-18\n\n\nNew AIDS-like disease in Asians, not contagious\n-----------------------------------------------\nResearchers have identified a mysterious new disease that has left scores of people in Asia and some in the United States with AIDS-like symptoms even though they are not infected with HIV. The patients' immune systems become damaged, leaving them unable to fend off germs as healthy people do. What triggers this isn't known, but the disease does not seem to be contagious.\n\nThis is another kind of acquired immune deficiency that is not inherited and occurs in adults, but doesn't spread the way AIDS does through a virus, said Dr. Sarah Browne, a scientist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She helped lead the study with researchers in Thailand and Taiwan where most of the cases have been found since 2004. Their report is in Thursday's [22 Aug 2012] New England Journal of Medicine [see below]. \"This is absolutely fascinating. I've seen probably at least 3 patients in the last 10 years or so\" who might have had this, said Dr. Dennis Maki, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. It's still possible that an infection of some sort could trigger the disease, even though the disease itself doesn't seem to spread person-to-person, he said.\n\nThe disease develops around age 50 on average but does not run in families, which makes it unlikely that a single gene is responsible, Browne said. Some patients have died of overwhelming infections, including some Asians now living in the U.S., although Browne could not estimate how many.\n\nA 62-year-old seamstress from Viet Nam who has lived in Tennessee since 1975, was gravely ill when she sought help for a persistent fever, infections throughout her bones and other bizarre symptoms in 2009. She had been sick off and on for several years and had visited Viet Nam in 1995 and again in early 2009. \"She was wasting away from this systemic infection\" that at 1st seemed like tuberculosis but wasn't, said Dr. Carlton Hays Jr., a family physician at the Jackson Clinic in Jackson, Tenn. \"She's a small woman to begin with, but when I 1st saw her, her weight was 91 pounds, and she lost down to 69 pounds.\"\n\nThis patient was referred to specialists at the National Institutes of Health who had been tracking similar cases. She spent nearly a year at an NIH hospital in Bethesda, Md., and is there now for monitoring and further treatment. \"I feel great now,\" she said Wednesday [21 Aug 2012]. But when she was sick, \"I felt dizzy, headaches, almost fell down,\" she said. \"I could not eat anything.\"\n\nAIDS is a specific disease, and it stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. That means the immune system becomes impaired during someone's lifetime, rather than from inherited gene defects like the \"bubble babies\" who are born unable to fight off germs. The virus that causes AIDS -- HIV [human immunodeficiency virus) -- destroys T-cells, key soldiers of the immune system that fight germs. The new disease doesn't affect those cells, but causes a different kind of damage. Browne's study of more than 200 people in Taiwan and Thailand found that most of those with the disease make substances called autoantibodies that block interferon-gamma, a chemical signal that helps the body clear infections.\n\nBlocking that signal leaves people like those with AIDS -- vulnerable to viruses, fungal infections and parasites, but especially mycobacteria, a group of germs that can cause severe lung damage. Researchers are calling this new disease an \"adult-onset\" immunodeficiency syndrome because it develops later in life and they don't know why or how. \"Fundamentally, we do not know what's causing them to make these antibodies,\" Browne said.\n\nAntibiotics aren't always effective, so doctors have tried a variety of other approaches, including a cancer drug that helps suppress production of antibodies. The disease quietens in some patients once the infections are tamed, but the faulty immune system is likely a chronic condition, researchers believe. The fact that nearly all the patients so far have been Asian or Asian-born people living elsewhere suggests that genetic factors and something in the environment such as an infection may trigger the disease, researchers conclude. The 1st cases turned up in 2004 and Browne's study enrolled about 100 people in 6 months. \"We know there are many others out there,\" including many cases mistaken as tuberculosis in some countries, she said.\n\n[Byline: Marilynn Marchione]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is assumed the preceding press statement is based on the paper titled: Adult-Onset Immunodeficiency in Thailand and Taiwan.

The authors' summary follows.\n\nBackground\n----------\nAutoantibodies against interferon-gamma are associated with severe disseminated opportunistic infection, but their importance and prevalence are unknown.\nMethods\n-----------\nWe enrolled 203 persons from sites in Thailand and Taiwan in 5 groups: 52 patients with disseminated, rapidly or slowly growing, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (group 1); 45 patients with another opportunistic infection, with or without nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (group 2); 9 patients with disseminated tuberculosis (group 3); 49 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (group 4); and 48 healthy controls (group 5). Clinical histories were recorded, and blood specimens were obtained.\nResults\n------\nPatients in groups 1 and 2 had CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts that were similar to those in patients in groups 4 and 5, and they were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Washed cells obtained from patients in groups 1 and 2 had intact cytokine production and a response to cytokine stimulation. In contrast, plasma obtained from these patients inhibited the activity of interferon-gamma in normal cells. High-titer anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies were detected in 81 percent of patients in group 1, 96 percent of patients in group 2, 11 percent of patients in group 3, 2 percent of patients in group 4, and 2 percent of controls (group 5). 40 other anticytokine autoantibodies were assayed. One patient with cryptococcal meningitis had autoantibodies only against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. No other anticytokine autoantibodies or genetic defects correlated with infections. There was no familial clustering.\nConclusions\n----------\nNeutralizing anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies were detected in 88 percent of Asian adults with multiple opportunistic infections and were associated with an adult-onset immunodeficiency akin to that of advanced HIV infection.\n\nThe adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome, mediated by the production of anti gamma-interferon antibodies, does not appear to be contagious and the condition develops around age 50 on average but does not run in families, which makes it unlikely that a single gene is responsible, The prevalence of this condition in Asian people, though not necessarily resident in Asia, implies a genetic origin rather than a cryptic infectious agent. But anything is possible. - Mod.CP]\n\n.................................................dk/sb/cp/ejp/ml", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1229456", "archive_id": "1229456", "date": "2012-08-05 18:10:07", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis A & C, HIV - USA: (CO) dental exposure", "main_text": "HEPATITIS A & C, HIV - USA: (COLORADO) DENTAL EXPOSURE\n***************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat4 Aug 2012\nSource: Highlands Ranch Herald [edited]\nhttp://www.ourcoloradonews.com/highlandsranch/news/three-former-dental-patients-test-positive/article_f506e33a-de7e-11e1-8992-0019bb2963f4.html\n\n\nEx-patients of dentist who reused syringes have HIV or hepatitis\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n3 former patients of Dr. Stephen Stein have been discovered to have hepatitis A or C or HIV. Stein ceased practicing in June 2011 after it was discovered he was reusing syringes during oral surgery. Any former dental or oral surgery patients of Dr. Stephen Stein's who have not been tested and who remember receiving intravenous medications, including sedation, at one of his offices, are encouraged to get tested.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE], which has urged more than 8000 former patients of Dr. Stephen Stein to seek testing for the three diseases, said that in order to protect patient confidentiality, it would not disclose which of the specific infections the patients have. Stein, who had a practice at 8671 S. Quebec St. in Highlands Ranch from September 1999 until June 2011, also saw patients at New Image Dental in Cherry Creek between August 2010 and June 2011.\n\nStein made an agreement with the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners to cease practicing in June 2011 after the health department concluded its investigation. Because he is no longer practicing, the state does not see Stein as a current threat and has stated that it will not conduct its own testing of him in an effort to match genetic material [of the contaminating viruses] of the infected patients with his. Hollynd Hoskins, a Denver attorney who is representing some of Stein's\nformer patients, called it a public health issue and said that Stein's patients have \"an absolute right to know if Dr. Stein himself was infected with any of these diseases.\"\n\nReferring to the Rose Medical Center case where operating room technician Kristen Parker infected at least 18 patients with hepatitis C in 2008-09, Hoskins said that ruling out whether Stein is carrying any of these diseases should be the first step. \"Dr. Stein should be asked to comply with voluntary testing by the CDPHE as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDCP],\" she said. \"I would also hope that law enforcement agencies such as the Denver Police Department or U.S. Attorney's Office would ask for that voluntary testing for the public health issue of all of these patients. If that is not successful, I would hope one of the agencies would seek a court order.\"\n\nHoskins said she assumed that the CDCP and CDPHE are already conducting an investigation similar to what they did with the Rose hepatitis C outbreak, in order to reach an opinion about whether there is a causal link between the patients who have tested positive for infectious diseases, and about the likelihood that the infection occurred during their treatment at Stein's office. \"It's a pretty high probability that they contracted these diseases from Dr. Stein's office, merely from what we know now from his unsafe injection practices,\" she said, adding that if they were not infected from Stein directly, it is likely that diseases were contacted via patient-patient transmission.\n\nAccording to a statement from the CDPHE, it cannot be determined that the positive results are necessarily linked to Stein's practice, due to \"the time frame and potential for infections from other source.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail correspondent Susan Baekeland\n\n[This report is posted as a public service to help reach more of Dr Stephen Stein's former 8000 patients.

Several thousand more children need to be tested in the south of this rural, mountainous country.\n\nSix health officials are already in prison serving 3 years for the infections and another 8 are waiting to stand trial . But UNICEF, the United Nation's children's organisation, has said that the infections are a failure of the national health system rather than the fault of individual doctors or nurses. In December [2011] it warned Kyrgyz officials against conducting a witch hunt against individual health workers. \"It may not be a failure of a particular doctor or nurse, but rather a failure of the healthcare system as a whole to provide hospitals with the essential equipment required to prevent transmission of HIV,\" UNICEF said in a statement. \"Placing all the responsibility on individual health care workers can only add to the ongoing tragedy and would further erode the trust between the patients and the health care system.\"\n\nKyrgyzstan is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia.

Tattoos can lead to local bacterial infections,\ncharacterized by redness, swelling, pain and a pus-like drainage.\n- Other skin problems. Sometimes granulomas form around tattoo ink,\nespecially red ink. Tattooing can also lead to raised areas caused by\nan overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids).\n- Bloodborne diseases.

[HIV-1 group N: travelling\nbeyond Cameroon, By Constance Delaugerre, Fabienne De Oliveira,\nCaroline Lascoux-Combe, Jean-Christophe Plantier, and Francois Simon.\nIn The Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9806, Page 1894, 26 Nov 2011;\nhttp://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61457-8/fulltext#article_upsell].\n\nThe 1st identified infection with the so-called \"group N\" strain of\nthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found in 1998 in a\nCameroonian woman who had progressed to AIDS. [For an explanation of\nthe nomenclature of HIV, see the moderator comment below]. Since then,\nmore than 12 000 HIV-infected patients living in Cameroon have been\ntested for group-N infection, but only 12 cases, including 2 couples,\nhave ever been found.\n\nThe new case, reported by French doctors, involves a 57-year-old man\nwho was admitted to the Saint Louis Hospital Paris in January [2011]\nsuffering from fever, rash, swollen lymph glands and genital\nulceration. The patient had high levels of a virus in the HIV-1\n\"family''[i.e., Family _Retroviridae_, genus _Lentivirus_, species\n_Human immunodeficiency virus_], but tests to pinpoint the particular\nstrain proved inconclusive.\n\nOn 9 Feb 2011, the patient developed facial paralysis. The French team\nthen carried out further tests on blood samples, which were found to\nreact in an antibody essay for the N strain. [For those in the trade:\nFourth-generation ELISA (ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Abbott, Chicago,\nIL) was weakly positive, and HIV-1 western blot (New Lav Blot I,\nBiorad, Paris, France). - Mod.CP].\n\nTracing his sexual history, the researchers believe the infection was\nprobably the \"group N\" virus acquired from intercourse with a partner\nin Togo, from where he had just returned. This case of HIV-1 group-N\nprimary infection indicates that this rare group is now circulating\noutside Cameroon, which emphasises the need for rigorous HIV\nepidemiological monitoring, according the the team led by Professor\nFrancois Simon.\n\nThe finding is important because the patient suffered not only severe\nsymptoms but also a fast-track decline in his immune system, as shown\nin the number of his CD4 white blood cells. He was given a powerful\n5-drug combination of anti-retrovirals, to which he responded, but\nneeds close monitoring in the future, the letter [in Lancet] stated.\n\nGroup N may have leapt to humans from chimpanzees, possibly through\nthe handling of bushmeat infected with the simian equivalent of HIV,\nscientists believed. It is one of 4 sub-types of virus gathered in the\nHIV-1 group, the others being M, which is by far the most prevalent, O\nand P. The P strain, like O and N is very rare and may have jumped to\nhumans from gorillas, according to a study published in 2009. There is\nalso a minority viral family [species] called HIV-2, which also may\nhave passed to humans from animal primates.\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 25 Nov 2011\nSource: NewsTonight {edited]\nhttp://newstonight.net/content/experts-confirm-12-group-n-cases-1998\n\n\nExperts Confirm 12 Group N Cases Since 1998\n-------------------------------------------\nBesides severe health conditions, AIDS is also observed as a social\nstigma in almost every part of the world. Consequently, experts are\n[striving] in order to develop some efficient measures that can reduce\nthe severity of HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, it has been reported that an\nextremely rare strain of AIDS virus has increased its [range] beyond\nthe boundaries of Cameroon. Earlier, health experts [detected] this\nuncommon virus only among a few people in the region.\n\nInvestigators identified the first N group infection earlier in 1998\nin a Cameroonian woman. Afterwards, this woman was observed to develop\nAIDS. Up till now, there are more than 12 000 confirmed HIV-infected\npatients in the region, [of whom only 12] have have tested positive\nfor group-N infection.\n\nRecently, French doctors described a 57-year-old man hospitalized in\nthe Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, in January 2011, suffering an array\nof disorders including fever, rash, swollen lymph glands as well as\ngenital ulceration. Medical tests have confirmed that the victim is\nsuffering from higher levels of an HIV-1 virus, though initial tests\nfailed to identify the particular strain conclusively. Later he\ndeveloped facial paralysis and admitted to have had sexual contact\nwith a Togolese partner and had developed HIV primary infection.\n\n\"This case of HIV-1 group-N primary infection indicates that this rare\ngroup is now circulating outside Cameroon, which emphasizes the need\nfor rigorous HIV epidemiological monitoring,\" noted the expert team.\nMeanwhile, scientists have claimed that a blend of 5 anti-retroviral\ndrugs has had beneficial effect.\n\n[Byline: Pratibha Minhas]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKunihiko Iizuka\n\n[There are 2 types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. Both types are transmitted\nby sexual contact, through blood, and from mother to child, and they\nappear to cause clinically indistinguishable AIDS. However, it seems\nthat HIV-2 is less easily transmitted, and the period between initial\ninfection and illness is longer in the case of HIV-2.\n\nWorldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1, and generally when people\nrefer to HIV without specifying the type of virus they will be\nreferring to HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated\nin West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. The strains of HIV-1 can\nbe classified into 4 groups: the \"major\" group M, the \"outlier\" group\nO and 2 new groups, N and P. These 4 groups may represent 4 separate\nintroductions of simian immunodeficiency virus into humans.\n\nGroup O appears to be restricted to west-central Africa and group N --\na strain discovered in 1998 in Cameroon and described in the Lancet\nletter -- is extremely rare. In 2009 a new strain closely relating to\ngorilla simian immunodeficiency virus was discovered in a Cameroonian\nwoman. It was designated HIV-1 group P. More than 90 percent of HIV-1\ninfections belong to HIV-1 group M. Within group M there are known to\nbe at least 9 genetically distinct subtypes (or clades) of HIV-1.\nThese are subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J and K.\n\nOccasionally, 2 viruses of different subtypes can infect the cells of\nan infected person and interact to create a new hybrid virus, but most\nof these new strains do not persist. Those that infect more than one\nperson are known as \"circulating recombinant forms.\" (From: AVERT HIV\nTypes, Subtypes Groups and Strains).\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the N-type HIV which appears to have\nspread from Cameroon to Togo and now been detected in the patient in a\nFrench hospital is an isolated phenomenon, or may be the harbinger of\nan epidemic in other parts of West Africa and beyond (including\nEurope).\n\nA map of Africa showing the location of Cameroon and Togo can be\naccessed at: http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/af.htm. -\nMod.CP]\nSee Also\n2009\n----\nHIV, human, gorilla - Cameroon: new lineage 20090803.2728\n2006\n----\nHIV, O-like lineage, gorillas - West Central Africa 20061110.3228\n2003\n----\nHIV-1: origin & history 20030614.1463\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n----\nHIV recombinants, global spread 20020520.4283\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\n1998\n----\nHIV, new strain - Cameroon 19980901.1755\nHIV/AIDS origin (02) 19980216.0304\nHIV/AIDS origin 19980212.0278\n.................................................cp/ejp/lm", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=875170", "archive_id": "875170", "date": "2011-09-17 11:45:47", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV - India: (GJ), children, blood transfusion", "main_text": "HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS - INDIA: (GUJARAT), CHILDREN, BLOOD\nTRANSFUSION\n****************************************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 12 Sep 2011\nSource: The Washington Post, Associated Press report [edited]\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/23-indian-children-suffering-from-genetic-disorder-get-hiv-from-blood-transfusions/2011/09/12/gIQAefVNMK_story.html\n\n\nChildren get HIV from blood transfusions\n----------------------------------------\nAt least 23 children suffering from a rare genetic disorder have\ntested positive for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] infection after\nreceiving tainted blood transfusions in western India, officials said\non Monday [12 Sep 2011]. The children all received free blood\ntransfusions at a government-run hospital in the Junagadh district of\nGujarat state between January and August [2011], hospital head G.T.\nDayalu said.\n\nState government spokesman Jai Narayan Vyas said a team of doctors has\nbeen sent to investigate. News reports quoted Vyas as saying that many\nof the infected children had received transfusions from more than one\nhospital. But the Indian Express newspaper reported that parents of\nthe children said they had received blood only at the government\nhospital.\n\nThe children suffer from thalassemia, a genetic disorder that requires\nregular transfusions. The children all belong to poor families.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Junagadh District is located on the Kathiawar peninsula in western\nGujarat. It is shown in the map at:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junagadh_district.\n\nHIV infections now wide-spread in India and unfortunately transmission\nof HIV by blood transfusion is not unknown in India, as the\nProMED-mail references below indicate. It appears that the children\nreceiving transfusions in the Junagadh district hospital in the Indian\nstate of Gujarat for treatment of their thalassemia were recipients of\nimproperly screened blood.\n\nThalassemia is a genetic disorder in which an abnormal form of\nhaemoglobin is produced. The disorder results in excessive destruction\nof red blood cells, which leads to anemia. There are 2 main types of\nthalassemia: alpha-thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to\nthe alpha globin protein are missing or mutated. Beta-thalassemia\noccurs when similar gene defects affect production of the beta globin\nprotein.\n\nAlpha-thalassemias occur most commonly in persons from southeast Asia,\nthe Middle East, China, and in those of African descent.\nBeta-thalassemias occur in persons of Mediterranean origin, and to a\nlesser extent, Chinese, other Asians. There are many forms of\nthalassemia. Each form (type) has many different subtypes. Both alpha\nand beta thalassemia exist in 2 forms. The most severe form of alpha\nthalassemia major causes stillbirth (death of the unborn baby during\nbirth or the late stages of pregnancy). Children born with thalessemia\nmajor (Cooley's anemia) are normal at birth, but develop severe anemia\nduring the 1st year of life.\n\nPersons with the minor form of alpha or beta thalassemia have small\nred blood cells but no symptoms.\n\nTreatment for thalassemia major often involves regular blood\ntransfusions and folate supplements. Persons who receive significant\nnumbers of blood transfusions need therapy to remove excess iron from\nthe body. Bone marrow transplant may help treat the disease in some\npatients, especially children.

A 5th organ was sent to\nNational Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan, which apparently\nsuffered a similar oversight. Speaking on the same occasion, Hung\nChien-ching, an attending physician in NTHU's infectious disease\ndepartment, said the hospital did not know the donor was an HIV\ncarrier. Local health departments usually do not expose carriers'\nidentities over privacy protection concerns. \"Before our team\nperformed the transplants, it had no way to know the donor was an HIV\ncarrier,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday [27 Aug 2011], Yao Ke-wu, director of the Bureau\nof Health of Hsinchu City, said the donor was a legally listed HIV\ncarrier in Taipei, who received treatment there until July [2011]\nbefore being referred to Hsinchu City for continued care. The\nincident, Yao said, exposed a major loophole in the domestic organ\ntransplant system.\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) said earlier in the day that NTUH, one\nof Taiwan's most prestigious health care institutions, transplanted\nthe organs of an HIV infected donor on Wednesday [24 Aug 2011] without\nrealizing it, putting 5 organ transplant recipients at high risk of\ncontracting AIDS. It marked the 1st time in Taiwan that organ\ntransplants might lead to recipients falling victim to AIDS, the DOH\nsaid.\n\nThe hospital informed the DOH of the incident on Saturday [27 Aug\n2011], said Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the DOH's Centers\nfor Disease Control. According to Shih, the hospital has offered\nemergency anti-AIDS medications to the 5 organ transplant recipients.\nYao Ke-wu, director of the Bureau of Health of Hsinchu City, said the\ndonor was a legally listed HIV carrier in Taipei, who sustained a\nserious head injury after accidentally falling from a high-rise\nbuilding on Wed 24 Aug 2011. As his condition was not promising, the\n37 year old's family took the initiative to contact NTUH to arrange\nthe transfer of his organs, Yao said. An NTUH transplant team rushed\nto the city's Nanmen Hospital to remove the man's organs and brought\nthem to Taipei for transplant into 5 different patients, Yao said. The\nDOH has demanded that NTUH present a complete report on the incident\nin 3 days.\n\nShih said the hospital has apologized to the patients and their\nfamilies as well as briefed them on the situation. To the best of his\nknowledge, Shih said the hospital has consistently conducted HIV\ntesting on organ donors. \"We don't know at the moment what went wrong\nin this case, which has left 5 innocent organ recipients facing AIDS\nrisks,\" Shih said.\n\nHIV is a lentivirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a\ncondition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system\nallows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to\nthrive.\n\n[byline: Chen Ching-fang, Sofia Wu]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Guidelines for preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency\nvirus through transplantation of human tissue and organs have been\npublished by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention -- MMWR Recommendations and Reports 1994; 43(RR-8); 1-17,\n20 May /(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031670.htm).\n\nThe present incident in Taiwan appears to have been an unfortunate\nconsequence of a failure in communication rather than any technical\ninsufficiency. The outcome of the current investigation of the\nincident is awaited. No doubt lessons will be learned.

It turns out the donor\nhad unprotected gay sex in the 11 weeks between the time he tested\nnegative and the time the surgery took place in 2009.\n\nIn a report Thursday [17 Mar 2011] on the New York City case, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that\norgan donors have repeat HIV tests a week before surgery. \"The most\nsensitive test needs to be done as close as possible to the time of\ntransplant,\" said Dr. Colin Shepard, who oversees tracking of HIV\ncases for the New York City Health Department. The CDC also said\nwould-be organ donors should be told to avoid behavior that can\nincrease their chances of infection. Living organ donors in the U.S.\nare routinely tested for infectious diseases such as hepatitis and\nHIV. But the organization that oversees organ transplants in the U.S.\ndoes not have an explicit policy on when such screening should be\ndone. That's left up to transplant centers.\n\nBecause of patient confidentiality, health officials released few\ndetails about the donor, recipient, their relationship or the hospital\nwhere the transplant took place, except to say that it is in New York.\nNeither the donor nor the recipient knew he or she had HIV until about\na year after the transplant, according to the CDC report. The\nrecipient developed AIDS, perhaps because he or she was on drugs that\nsuppress the immune system to prevent organ rejection, while the donor\ndid not, health officials said. Both are receiving HIV treatment.\nTheir conditions were not disclosed in the report.\n\n\"We don't know how frequently this is happening and we need better\nsurveillance,\" said Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, a CDC official who co-wrote\nthe report. HIV infections in a donor or recipient may not be\ndiscovered until long after a transplant, and even then, patients and\ntheir doctors may not make the connection and report it, health\nofficials said. In this case, once health authorities were notified\nlate last year [2010], they spent months investigating whether the\ntransplanted kidney was the source of the patient's AIDS infection.\nGenetic analysis of the virus confirmed investigators' suspicions.\n\nAt least one similar U.S. case has been reported in the media. An\nOrlando,Florida, woman last year filed a lawsuit saying she was\ninfected with HIV through a 2007 kidney transplant from a live donor\nin Florida. However, CDC officials said they have not been asked to\ninvestigate and could not confirm the report.\n\nBefore that, Italian doctors reported HIV transmission from a live\norgan donor in 1989. Since the 1980s, there has been a confirmed\nreport of a deceased donor's organs spreading the AIDS virus. That\nhappened in Illinois in 2007, when organs from a 38-year-old gay man\nwent to 4 recipients.\n\nFor many years, transplant organizations focused heavily on screening\norgans taken from the dead, which accounted for the large majority of\ntransplants. But kidneys from live donors are becoming increasingly\ncommon. In 1988, about 32 percent of kidney transplants came from live\ndonors. By last year, it was more than 46 percent, according to\nfederal data. Donors generally are relatives or friends.\n\nAbout 88 000 people are on the kidney waiting list right now,\naccording the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit\norganization that manages the nation's organ transplant system for the\nfederal government. The group is developing new nationwide policies\nfor live donors, spokesman Joel Newma said. Transplant centers have\nteams that evaluate potential donors and look for physical or\npsychological red flags.\n\nBut some would-be donors may find themselves in a quandary: They want\nto save a loved one's life but are unwilling to reveal that they use\ndrugs, have gay sex or engage in other behavior that raises their risk\nof HIV. Some donors may assume they will be tested for every important\nkind of infection, and think it doesn't matter whether they disclose\ntheir risky behavior, Kuehnert said.\n\nCDC officials recommend a HIV test developed in the 1990s that is\nmore sensitive than traditional testing. The more sensitive test can\ndetect HIV within 10 days after the person is 1st infected. An older\ntest won't detect antibodies to HIV until 3 to 8 weeks after\ninfection. Yet the older tests are more commonly done.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A full account of this incident can be read at: \"HIV Transmitted\nfrom a Living Organ Donor --- New York City, 2009,\" MMWR Weekly, March\n18, 2011 / 60(10);297-301\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6010a1.htm?s_cid=mm6010a1_e&source=govdelivery>.\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2007\n----\nHIV, organ transplantation - Italy 20070308.0825\n.................................................sb/cp/ejp/dk\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

LACDPH recommends that patients who received intravenous\nmedication at this clinic during that time to contact their primary care\nphysicians or health care providers to get tested for hepatitis B and\nhepatitis C and HIV.\n\nDuring an investigation at the pain clinic, it was discovered that a\nsyringe and needle, which had been used to inject intravenous medication\ninto a patient, was then used to obtain medication from a vial that could\nbe used for other patients. Using a needle and syringe, that had previously\nbeen used on a patient could have contaminated the vial with the blood of\nthe patient. To date, LACDPH has identified 2 cases of acute viral\nhepatitis in patients at this clinic. One patient had acute hepatitis C and\nthe other patient had acute hepatitis B. Both patients had onset of their\ninfections in 2010. The investigation is ongoing. There may be other cases\nof acute viral hepatitis that have not yet been reported to LACDPH.\n\nThe document consists of a comprehensive series of statements providing\ninformation and instructions for those who may consider themselves to be at\nrisk.\n\nThis is an ongoing investigation.

Shooting\nUp: infections among injecting drug users in the United Kingdom 2009.\nLondon: Health Protection Agency, November 2010.] focuses on HIV\namong injecting drugs users (IDUs), available at:\n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1287143581697>.\nIts key findings are that:\n\n-- prevalence of HIV among those who have injected drugs remains low\nand is estimated to be 1.5 percent overall in the UK. However, it\nvaries across the country from 0.6 percent in Scotland to 4.1 percent\nin London;\n\n-- HIV prevalence among current injectors has increased from 0.7\npercent to 1.5 percent over the past decade, and is now similar to\nthe level found in the early 1990s;\n\n-- uptake of HIV testing is improving, with 3-quarters (75 percent)\nof IDUs now reporting that they have had a test; however, about a 3rd\n(37 percent) of IDUs with HIV remain unaware of their infection;\n\n-- the vast majority (79 percent) of the HIV-infected IDUs in contact\nwith specialist HIV-treatment services are receiving anti-retroviral therapy;\n\n-- overall around one-half of IDUs have been infected with hepatitis\nC virus, one-6th with hepatitis B virus and about one-3rd reported a\nsymptom of a bacterial infection (such as a sore or abscess) at an\ninjecting site in the past year;\n\n-- needle and syringe sharing has declined in recent years, but\nalmost one-5th (19 percent) of injecting drug users continue to share.\n\nThe findings presented in the report indicate a need to continue the\ndevelopment of services to reduce injecting-related harms and to\nsupport those who want to stop injecting. These services should be\ndeveloped in line with published guidelines to ensure that their\nprovision has sufficient coverage to prevent infections\n\nIt is also noted that public health surveillance of the diseases and\nbehaviours associated with injecting drugs continues to be an\nimportant tool to inform the development of UK policies and services\nin this area.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These findings are rather surprising in that among IDUs HCV at 50\npercent is the most prevalent blood-borne virus infection followed by\nHBV and bacterial infections, with HIV a long way behind.

Hospital officials said that\na 3-member committee had been formed by the hospital to enquire into\nthe matter.\n\nAt least 5 children were infected with HIV and 29 with hepatitis [C\nvirus] at the same hospital in December 2008 following transfusion of\ninfected blood, after which the state government had constituted a\ncommittee headed by RND Purohit, the Director of the State AIDS\nControl Society, who had suggested the need for adopting more\nadvanced techniques of [screening] blood donations.\n\nThe secretary of Thalassaemia Society, Vipin Gupta, claimed that no\naction [had been] taken on the report. \"Had the step been taken on\nthe recommendation of that committee, we would not have had these new\nHIV infections,\" he said. However, RK Aseri, Principal of the SN\nMedical College, said that a proposal for introducing the advanced\nnucleic acid test (NAT) technique has already been sent to the state\ngovernment. According to Gupta, the present technique being used in\ntesting the blood during donation is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA), which has a window period -- the period of time\nbetween HIV infection and the production of antibodies -- of 2-8\nweeks. During the window [i.e. blind] period, an antibody test may\ngive a false negative result. \"When we have the technology called NAT\n[available], which has a window [i.e. blind] period of 3-7 days, how\ncan we allow the children to become infected with HIV and hepatitis,\"\nhe [asked]. Gupta demanded early introduction of the NAT technique\nand the setting-up of a fully equipped and staffed Thalassemia ward.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal\nsynthesis of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin consists of 2 main protein chains\ncalled alpha and beta. Alpha-thalassemia involves defects in one or\nmore of the 4 genes required to make each protein chain. The main\nsymptom is anemia, the severity of which can vary amongst patients\ndepending on how many defective genes are involved.

The virus is dormant in the bone marrow cells, she said, but\nwhen those progenitor cells develop into blood cells, it can be\nreactivated and cause renewed infection. The virus kills the new\nblood cells and then moves on to infect other cells, she said. \"If\nwe're ever going to be able to find a way to get rid of the cells,\nthe 1st step is to understand where a latent infection can continue,\"\nCollins said.\n\nIn recent years, drugs have reduced AIDS deaths sharply, but patients\nneed to keep taking the medicines for life or the infection comes\nback, she said. That's an indication that while the drugs battle the\nactive virus, some of the disease remains hidden away to flare up\nonce the therapy is stopped. One hide-out was found earlier in blood\ncells called macrophages. Another pool was discovered in memory\nT-cells, and research began on attacking those. But those couldn't\naccount for all the HIV virus still circulating, Collins said,\nshowing there were more locations to check out and leading her to\nstudy the blood cell progenitors.\n\nFinding these sources of infection is important because eliminating\nthem would allow AIDS patients to stop taking drugs after their\ninfection was over. That's critical in countries where the treatment\nis hard to afford and deliver. \"I don't know how many people realize\nthat although the drugs have reduced mortality we still have a long\nway to go,\" Collins said in a telephone interview. \"That is mainly\nbecause we can't stop the drugs, people have to take it for a\nlifetime.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health,\nBurroughs Wellcome Foundation, University of Michigan, Rackham\nPredoctoral Fellowship, National Science Foundation and a Bernard\nMaas Fellowship.\n\n[Byline: Randolph E. Schmid]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] UMHS press release\nDate: Sun 7 Mar 2010\nSource: University of Michigan Health System Newsroom [edited]\n<http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=1502>\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan (U-M) scientists have identified a new\nreservoir for hidden HIV-infected cells that can serve as a factory\nfor new infections. The findings, which appear online today [7 Mar\n2010] in Nature Medicine (see abstract at [3] below), indicate a new\ntarget for curing the disease so those infected with the virus may\nsomeday no longer rely on AIDS drugs for a lifetime. \"Antiviral drugs\nhave been effective at keeping the virus at bay. However, once the\ndrug therapy is stopped, the virus comes back,\" says senior author of\nthe study Kathleen L. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of\nboth internal medicine and microbiology and immunology at the U-M\nMedical School.\n\nIn people infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the virus\nthat causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency disease syndrome),\nthere's an unsolved problem with current anti-viral drugs. Though\nlife-saving, they cannot root the virus out of the body. Infected\ncells are able to live on, undetected by the immune system, and\nprovide the machinery for the virus to reproduce and spread.\n\nThis has led researchers to believe HIV-infected cells may lie in\nwait somewhere in the body. Important new research by U-M has\ndiscovered that bone marrow, previously thought to be resistant to\nthe virus, can contain latent forms of the infection. \"This finding\nis important because it helps explain why it's hard to cure the\ndisease,\" Collins says. \"Ultimately to cure this disease, we're going\nto have to develop specific strategies aimed at targeting these\nlatently infected cells.\" \"Currently, people have to take anti-viral\ndrugs for their entire life to control the infection,\" she says. \"It\nwould be easier to treat this disease in countries that don't have\nthe same resources as we do with a course of therapy for a few\nmonths, or even years. But based on what we know now, people have to\nstay on drugs for their entire life.\"\n\nUsing tissue samples, U-M researchers detected HIV genomes in bone\nmarrow isolated from people effectively treated with antiviral drugs\nfor more than 6 months. While further studies are needed to\ndemonstrate that stem cells can harbor the HIV virus, the study\nresults confirm that HIV targets some long-lived progenitor cells,\nyoung cells that have not fully developed but mature into cells with\nspecial immune functions. When active infection occurs, the toxic\neffects of the virus kill the cell even as the newly made viral\nparticles spread the infection to new target cells.\n\n\"Our finding that HIV infects these cells has clear ramifications for\nHIV disease, because some of these cells may be long-lived and could\ncarry latent HIV for extended periods of time,\" she says. \"These HIV\ncell reservoirs can be induced to generate new infections.\" The new\nresearch gives a broader view of how HIV overwhelms the body's immune\nsystem and devastates its ability to regenerate itself.\n\nGlobally, more than 30 million people are infected with HIV,\nincluding millions of children. Improvements have been made since the\n1990s in the way the disease is treated that have led to an 85-90\npercent reduction in mortality. \"Drugs now available are effective at\ntreating the virus, making HIV more of a chronic disease than a death\nsentence,\" Collins says. \"This has made a huge impact in quality of\nlife; however, only 40 percent of people worldwide are receiving\nanti-viral drugs, and unfortunately that means that not everybody is\nbenefiting.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Nature Medicine abstract\nDate: Sun 7 Mar 2010\nSource: Nature Medicine online [edited]\n<http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nm.2109.html>\n\n\nTitle: HIV-1 infects multipotent progenitor cells causing cell death\nand establishing latent cellular reservoirs Authors: Christoph C\nCarter, Adewunmi Onafuwa-Nuga, Lucy A McNamara, James Riddell IV,\nDale Bixby, Michael R Savona and Kathleen L Collins.\n\nAbstract: HIV causes a chronic infection characterized by depletion\nof CD4+ T lymphocytes and the development of opportunistic\ninfections. Despite drugs that inhibit viral spread, HIV infection\nhas been difficult to cure because of uncharacterized reservoirs of\ninfected cells that are resistant to highly active antiretroviral\ntherapy (HAART) and the immune response. Here we used CD34+ cells\nfrom infected people as well as in vitro studies of wild-type HIV to\nshow infection and killing of CD34+ multipotent hematopoietic\nprogenitor cells (HPCs). In some HPCs, we detected latent infection\nthat stably persisted in cell culture until viral gene expression was\nactivated by differentiation factors. A unique reporter HIV that\ndirectly detects latently infected cells in vitro confirmed the\npresence of distinct populations of active and latently infected\nHPCs. These findings have major implications for understanding HIV\nbone marrow pathology and the mechanisms by which HIV causes persis!\ntent infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The finding that HIV infects some long-lived progenitor cells is an\nimportant feature of HIV disease because some of these cells could\ncarry latent HIV for extended periods of time. Subsequently, such HIV\ncell reservoirs may be induced to generate new infections. The\nability of HIV to target certain long-lived progenitor cells explains\nsome of the features of AIDS and explains the inability to eradicate\nthe virus by treatment with antiviral drugs targeting replicating\nvirus.\n\nThe multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells used experimentally in\nthe experiments conducted at the University of Michigan were CD34+\ncells from infected people. CD34 is an important adhesion molecule\nthat is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on\nlymph node endothelia whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on\nthe T cell (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34>). Cells\nexpressing CD34 (CD34+ cell) are normally found in the umbilical cord\nand bone marrow as hematopoietic cells. Cells expressing CD34 respond\nto SCF (stem cell factor) and LIF in the presence of colony\nstimulating factors (see: CSF), and these factors can induce myeloid\ndifferentiation in these cells (see\n<http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=cd34>).\n\nGeneral information on HIV and AIDS can be obtained at:\n<http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2003\n----\nHIV-1: origin & history 20030614.1463\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n----\nHIV recombinants, global spread 20020520.4283\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\n..................................................cp/msp/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Gorillas have been found, for the 1st time, to be a source\nof HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]. Previous research had shown\nthe HIV-1 strain, the main source of human infections, with 33\nmillion cases worldwide, originated from a virus in chimpanzees.\n\nBut researchers have now discovered an HIV infection in a Cameroonian\nwoman which is clearly linked to a gorilla strain, Nature Medicine\n[Nature Medicine Volume 15 No 7. 2009] reports. A researcher told the\nBBC that, though it was a new type of HIV, current drugs might still\nhelp combat its effects. \"There's no reason to believe this virus\nwill present any new problems, as it were, that we don't already face.\"\n\nAlthough HIV/AIDS was 1st recognised by scientists in the 1980s, it\nis thought to have 1st entered the human population early in the 20th\ncentury in the region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus\nprobably originally jumped into humans after people came into contact\nwith infected bush meat. SIV viruses have been reported in other\nprimates, including gorillas.\n\nFrench doctors treating a 62-year-old Cameroonian woman who was\nliving in Paris said they initially spotted some discrepancies in\nroutine viral load tests. Further analysis of the HIV strain she was\ninfected with showed it was more closely related to SIV from gorillas\nthan HIV from humans. She is the only person known to be infected\nwith the new strain, but the researchers expect to find other cases.\n\nBefore moving to Paris, she had lived in a semi-urban area of\nCameroon and had no contact with gorillas or bush meat, suggesting\nshe caught the virus from someone else who was carrying the gorilla\nstrain. Analysis of the virus in the laboratory has confirmed that it\ncan replicate in human cells. Co-author Dr David Robertson, from the\nUniversity of Manchester, said it was the 1st definitive transfer of\nHIV seen from a source other than a chimpanzee, and highlighted the\nneed to monitor for the emergence of new strains. \"This demonstrates\nthat HIV evolution is an ongoing process. The virus can jump from\nspecies to species, from primate to primate, and that includes us;\npathogens have been with us for millions of years and routinely\nswitch host species. The fact the patient had been diagnosed in\nFrance showed how human mobility can rapidly transfer a virus from\none area of the world to another.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Wold Today programme, Dr Robertson said there\nwas no reason to believe that existing drugs would not work on the\nnew virus. \"If some day we do manage to develop a vaccine, there's no\nreason to believe it wouldn't work,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Paul Sharp, from the University of Edinburgh, said the\nvirus probably initially transferred from chimpanzees to gorillas. He\nsaid the latest finding was interesting but perhaps not surprising.\n\"The medical implication is that, because this virus is not very\nclosely related to the other 3 HIV-1 groups, it is not detected by\nconventional tests. So the virus could be cryptically spreading in\nthe population.\" However, he said that he would guess it would not\nspread widely and become a major problem. \"Although the patient with\nthis virus was not ill, there is no reason to believe that it will\nnot lead to AIDS,\" he added.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon 3 Aug 2009\nSource: Medical News Today [edited]\n<http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159623.php>\n\n\nScientists Find New Human HIV From Gorillas\n-------------------------------------------\nScientists who found a new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a\nCameroonian woman living in Paris, have discovered it is an unusual\nvariant of HIV-1 that could have come from gorillas. The research\nthat led to the findings was headed by Dr Jean-Christophe Plantier of\nthe University of Rouen in France and is published in the 2 Aug 2009\nonline issue of Nature Medicine. Drs David Robertson and Jonathan\nDickerson from the Faculty of Life Sciences at The University of\nManchester, UK, were also involved in the study.\n\nThere are 3 established lineages of HIV-1, known as M, N, and O,\nwhich came from chimpanzees, but this new variant appears to be the\nprototype of a new lineage derived from gorillas and shows no\nevidence of recombination with the other known lineages, wrote the\nresearchers. They propose that the new lineage be called HIV-1 group P.\n\nThere are 33 million people worldwide living with AIDS which is\ncaused by the HIV-1 virus group M (groups N and O are mainly confined\nto Cameroon). HIV is a product of cross-species transmission of\nsimian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) found in chimpanzees, thought to\nhave crossed to humans from eating infected bush meat. While 1st\nrecognized in 1980, HIV is thought to have started some 80 years\nearlier in and around the African country that is now called the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe 62-year old Cameroonian woman at the centre of the study moved to\nParis in 2004 and began to have symptoms shortly afterwards. Her\nblood sample showed discrepancies in her viral load, and further\ntests revealed she was infected with a new strain of HIV that more\nclosely resembled SIV from gorillas than HIV from humans. However,\nbefore moving to Paris the woman had lived in a semi-urban part of\nthe central west African Republic of Cameroon; she had not come into\ncontact with bush meat or gorillas.\n\nBecause of this information and the fact further tests showed that\nthe virus was able to replicate in human cells, the scientists\nsuggest the strain may well appear elsewhere. Robertson told the\nmedia that: \"The discovery of this novel HIV-1 lineage highlights the\ncontinuing need to monitor closely for the emergence of new HIV\nvariants. This demonstrates that HIV evolution is an ongoing process.\nThe virus can jump from species to species, from primate to primate,\nand that includes us; pathogens have been with us for millions of\nyears and routinely switch host species,\" he added.\n\nIn the same way as the current swine flu pandemic is showing us, this\nis another example of how viruses can now move very quickly around\nthe world because nowadays large numbers of humans travel long\ndistances in a short space of time.\n\nPlantier's team in France are part of a network of laboratories that\nhas been monitoring HIV genetic diversity, while The Manchester Life\nSciences team helped with the computer-based evolutionary analysis.\n\n[Byline: Catharine Paddock, PhD]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reference for the paper on which these reports are based is:\n\"A new human immunodeficiency virus derived from gorillas.\" By\nJean-Christophe Plantier, Marie Leoz, Jonathan E Dickerson, Fabienne\nDe Oliveira, Francois Cordonnier, Veronique Lemee, Florence Damond,\nDavid L Robertson and Francois Simon.

The\nmedical board and many injured patients are claiming the health care\nproviders are responsible for exposing and transmitting hepatitis C virus\ninfection.\n\nBay Area medical injury attorneys reveal the following regarding the Nevada\nBoard of Medical Examiners' investigation into this awful tragedy:\n\n- federal and local health officials have urged more than 53 000 former\npatients of the Shadow Lane and Burnham Avenue facilities to get tested for\nhepatitis B and C, and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus];\n- Carrol performed a colonoscopy on a known hepatitis C patient early in\nthe day;\n- Carrol treated a patient later that day who contracted hepatitis C;\n- Desai and Carrera performed procedures on 6 people who were infected with\nhepatitis C the same day;\n- unsafe injection practices (reuse of syringes on different patients) by\nnurse anesthetists led to transmission of hepatitis C;\n- Southern Nevada Health District has definitively linked 8 hepatitis C\ntransmissions to the Shadow Lane facility;\n- one hepatitis C case is linked to a sister facility (Desert Shadow\nEndoscopy Center).\n\nLegal government health and law informers for Justice in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, discovered since the outbreak, federal and local health\nofficials have urged more than 53 000 former patients from the Shadow Lane\nand Burnham Avenue facilities be tested for hepatitis B and C, and HIV.\nHealth officials say 105 hepatitis cases are \"possibly associated\" with one\nof the clinics and health care providers. Contracting hepatitis or HIV\nbecause a doctor, hospital, or health care provider has been negligent is a\ncivil injustice.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since the previous report of this incident posted on ProMED-mail on Fri 6\nSep 2008, the number of confirmed cases of hepatitis C virus infection\nremains at 8, and the number of 'possibly associated' cases has increased\nfro 100 to 105. The number of recalled patients has risen from 50 000 to 53\n000 making this now the largest patient recall in US history. Curiously no\ncase of transmission of hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus\nhas been identified so far.

The figure, however, should\ncontinue to rise as more of the 50 000 patients notified by the\nclinic are tested for possible exposure to the virus. The case could\nsurpass the damages caused by a similar incident in Nebraska in 2000,\nconsidered the nation's largest health care-related outbreak, with 99\nreported infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In February 2008, the Southern Nevada Health District advised\npatients who received injected anesthesia medication at the Endoscopy\nCenter of Nevada of a risk for possible exposure to hepatitis C and\nother bloodborne pathogens [see: Hepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial\n(02): USA (NV), archive number 20080228.0809]. The health district\nrecommended that patients who had procedures requiring injected\nanesthesia at the clinic between March 2004 and 11 Jan 2008 contact\ntheir primary care physicians or health care providers to get tested\nfor hepatitis C as well as hepatitis B and HIV.\n\nAt that time, the health district had received notification of 3\nacute cases of hepatitis C in January 2008 and has identified a total\nof 6 further cases; 5 of these cases had procedures requiring\ninjected anesthesia on the same day. Following a joint investigation\nwith the Nevada State Bureau of Licensure and Certification (BLC) and\nwith consultation from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, the health district determined that unsafe injection\npractices related to the administration of anesthesia medication\nmight have exposed patients to the blood of other patients. Genetic\ntesting on 4 of the cases contracting infection on the same day has\nidentified that they likely came from a common source. The patient\nthat had a procedure on a different day did not share a common source\nas did the other 4. This indicated that the problem that allowed\ndisease transmission to occur was not a one-time event but had\nrecurred over an extended period. Investigation of the clinic\npractices identified common practices that would allow disease to be\ntransmitted in this manner.\n\nSince that report, it transpires that more than 90 cases of hepatitis\nC virus infection have been identified, and more than 50 000 patients\nare being recalled for testing. Thus, this outbreak may become the\nlargest outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection in the USA. Up to the\npresent, the largest hepatitis C outbreak was a consequence of\nmalpractice at a clinic in Nebraska. In November 2002, ProMED-mail\n(see, Hepatitis C, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) (02), archive\nnumber 20021120.5857) reported that 612 patients at the Fremont\nOncology Clinic had been sent letters advising them of risk of\nhepatitis C virus infection as the result of a faulty procedure. In\ntotal, 81 of 485 patients who responded tested positive for hepatitis\nC virus infection. Mod.MPP commented at the time that an attack rate\nof 17 percent (81/485) suggested that unsafe injection practices were\noccurring over a period of time rather than as a unique event. This\nobservation is supported by a recent report (see: News Blaze online\n<http://newsblaze.com/story/20080925110427zzzz.nb/topstory.html>)\nthat the number of confirmed cases in this incident has risen to 99. - Mod.CP]\n\n[For a map of the United States see\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/united_states_pol02.pdf>.\nNevada is in the southwestern portion of the USA.\n\nFor the interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of the United States with\nlinks to other recent ProMED postings on events in the United States\nand surrounding areas, see\n<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=40,-97.6,4>. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial (03): USA (NV) 20080302.0854\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial (02): USA (NV) 20080228.0809\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA: (NV), aler... 20080228.0802\n2002\n----\nHepatitis C, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) (02) 20021120.5857\nHepatitis C virus, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) 20021017.5579\n.................................mpp/cp/msp/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The health district is recommending that\npatients who had procedures requiring injected anesthesia at the\nclinic between March 2004 and 11 Jan 2008 contact their primary care\nphysicians or health care providers to get tested for hepatitis C as\nwell as hepatitis B and HIV.\n\nThe health district received notification of 3 acute cases of\nhepatitis C in January 2008 and has identified a total of 6 cases to\ndate; 5 of the cases had procedures requiring injected anesthesia\non the same day. Following a joint investigation with the Nevada\nState Bureau of Licensure and Certification (BLC) and with\nconsultation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the\nhealth district determined that unsafe injection practices related to\nthe administration of anesthesia medication might have exposed\npatients to the blood of other patients. The exposures did not result\nfrom the [other] medical procedures performed.\n\nThe cluster of illnesses came to the attention of the health district\nin January 2008. These cases were reported to the health district by\narea physicians. Nevada law requires that medical providers notify\npublic health officials when they identify a number of different\ndiseases, including hepatitis C. The common link between cases was\nidentified through the routine investigation of the cases reported by\nmedical providers, which includes an interview of the patient. Most\npeople infected with hepatitis C virus do not develop symptoms and do\nnot know that they have been infected. As a result, these infections\nwould not have been reported to the health district. An infection\nwith hepatitis C that results in the patient developing symptoms\n(acute disease) is rare, so it is an unusual occurrence that brought\nthis problem to the attention of the health district. On average, 2\ncases of acute hepatitis C are reported each year in Clark County;\n6 cases have been identified in relation to this investigation.\n\nA syringe (not a needle) that was used to administer medication to a\npatient was reused on the same patient to draw up additional\nmedication. The process of redrawing medication using the same\nsyringe could have contaminated the vial from which the medicine was\ndrawn with the blood of the patient. The vial, which was not labeled\nfor use on multiple patients, was then used for a 2nd patient (with a\nclean needle and syringe). If that vial was contaminated with the\nblood of the 1st patient, any subsequent patients given medication\nfrom that vial could have been exposed to bloodborne pathogens. [At\nthis point in the original text, the process of contamination is\nillustrated by downloadable diagram. - Mod.CP]\n\nOf the 6 known cases, 5 had procedures on the same day. Genetic\ntesting on 4 of the cases from that day has identified they likely\ncame from a common source. The patient that had a procedure on a\ndifferent day does not share a common source as the other 4. This\nindicates that the problem that allowed disease transmission to occur\nwas not a one-time event but had recurred over an extended period.\nInvestigation of the clinic practices identified common practices\nthat would allow disease to be transmitted in this manner.\n\nThe unsafe injection practices associated with these cases were\nidentified during the investigation conducted in mid-January 2008.\nThe injection practices that led to the exposure have been\ncorrected, so no new patient exposures should be occurring. As it can\ntake several months for the symptoms of hepatitis C to appear,\nadditional cases might be identified despite no ongoing transmission\nof disease. The investigation revealed practices that could have\nexposed patients to the blood of another patient.\n\nAlthough hepatitis C was the focus of the investigation, hepatitis B\nand HIV can be transmitted in the same manner. It is unknown how many\npeople were infected at the clinic. Hepatitis C, B and HIV are\nroutinely found in the population. A significant number of people\nmight have been infected prior to their procedure. Although testing\ncan determine whether a person is infected, it cannot determine the\nsource of the infection.\n\nHepatitis C, B or HIV can result in a range of disease severity and\ncan eventually result in death. It is important that patients speak\nwith a physician or health care provider if they have one of these\ndiseases. A physician will be able to address specific risks for\nserious illness and develop a plan to monitor patients' health.\n\nOn average, 2 cases of acute hepatitis C are identified each year in\nClark County. Most people who become infected with hepatitis C\ninitially have mild or no symptoms and do not know that they have\nbeen infected unless they are tested by a doctor. Only a small\npercentage of people infected with hepatitis C develop acute disease\nand have any outward signs of infection.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Health District is responsible for investigating\nreports of illness in our community in order to take steps to protect\nthe health and well-being of the public. Once notified of a\nreportable disease, the health district begins an investigation and\nworks with the appropriate agencies to address any issues identified\nand make recommendations to help prevent this type of situation from\noccurring again.\n\nWhen proper injection practices are followed, medical procedures,\nincluding colonoscopies or similar procedures, are generally safe.\nAll health care professionals and medical facilities should follow\nsafe injection practices and infection control procedures. Patients\ncan and should ask their medical providers about the practices used\nin their facility.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKatharine Briller, RN\nHarborview Medical Center\nSeattle, WA\nNICU\n<brillerkate@hotmail.com>\n\n[This comprehensive statement answers the questions posed previously.\nReaders should download the diagram from the original text to obtain\na graphic illustration of the deficient procedure. So far, the number\nof patients developing hepatitis C disease has been small, but the\nconsequences of infection with hepatitis B virus and HIV may not be\napparent for many years and are a cause for concern. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA: (NV), alert, RFI 20080228.0802\n2007\n----\nHepatitis C, fibrinogen-transmitted - Japan: RFI 20071217.4063\nHepatitis C, physician-associated cluster - USA (NY) (04) 20071211.3988\nHepatitis C, hemodialysis unit - Spain (Barcelona) 20071209.3969\nHepatitis C, physician-associated cluster - USA (NY) (03) 20071207.3951\nHepatitis C, physician-associated cluster - USA (NY) (02) 20070628.2080\nHepatitis C, physician-associated cluster - USA (NY) 20070616.1965\nHepatitis C, single source outbreak, 1998 - Spain (02) 20070227.0705\n2005\n----\nHepatitis C, isotope contamination suspected - USA (MD) 20050105.0019\n2003\n----\nHepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel (03) 20030816.2038\nHepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel (02) 20030814.2025\nHepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel 20030813.2016\n2002\n----\nHepatitis C, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) (02) 20021120.5857\nHepatitis C virus, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) 20021017.5579\n..............................................................cp/msp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

They said around 650 people\nworking at barbershops in the capital visited the DHS laboratories\nduring the last 3 years and that of them, 10 were positive for\nHIV/AIDS and 52 for different types of hepatitis. They said the\nremaining barbers did not carry any diseases. Officials said the DHS\ninspectors visited 195 salons in 2006 and fined owners of 55 salons\nbecause their workers were not tested for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.\nUnder the laws, DHS gives 7 days to owners of unsanitary salons to\ncarry out these tests on their employees. In case the instructions go\nunheeded, fines are handed down to salon owners.\nBut as the fines are generally found to be very low, barbers ignore\nthese notices and carry on their businesses in a manner that poses\nserious threats to the health of their customers. A salon worker said\nthat going to DHS laboratories for AIDS and hepatitis tests consumed\na lot of time, as they were located far away. \"This affects the\nbusiness, and, therefore, barbers prefer to pay small fines,\" he\nsaid. He proposed the DHS arrange mobile tests for barbers. DHS\ncharges Rs 240 [USD 6] for these tests as compared with Rs 1000 [USD\n25] being charged by private laboratories.

The 2 most recent victims, aged 3 and 4, were diagnosed with\nHIV in the Sairam district and the city of Turkestan respectively,\nsaid regional health department spokeswoman Ayzhan Umarova.\nThe Kazakhstan nation has been shocked after scores of children and\n13 mothers contracted HIV through injections or blood transfusions at\nhospitals in the city of Shymkent, some 1000 miles south of the\ncapital, Astana; 8 children who contracted AIDS in [this incident have died].\nThe Kazakh medical authorities have been testing thousands of mothers\nand children feared to be at risk of contracting HIV. Nationwide\ninspections have revealed numerous cases of incompetence and\ncorruption among doctors and nurses; 21 doctors and health officials\naccused of causing the outbreak went on trial in Shymkent in January 2007.\nSince the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, HIV/AIDS has swept\nacross the former Communist countries. According to the United\nNations, there were 1.6 million people living with HIV in Eastern\nEurope and Central Asia in 2005, a more than 20-fold increase in less\nthan a decade.\nMost of the people with HIV in the region are in Russia and Ukraine,\nbut the situation has also worsened in Central Asia. According to the\nWorld Bank, the number of HIV/AIDS patients in Kazakhstan has been\ndoubling annually since 2000, and UNICEF estimates that the true\nnumber of people with HIV is 3 times higher than what it says is the\nofficial figure of about 7000.\n--\nBrent Barrett\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[The number of confirmed cases of HIV-infection of Kazakh children\nwas reported to be 55 on 20 Sep 2006, 72 in early October 2006, and\nmost recently 91 on 14 Feb 2007.

The person wrote \"negative\"\ninstead of \"positive\" after reading the automatically generated\nprint-out report of the results of laboratory analyses, including\nblood testing for HIV. The organ donor was a woman in her forties who\ndied at home of a brain hemorrhage but had no clinical history of any\ndiseases. After her death, the family had assented to organ and\ntissue donation not knowing that she had been HIV-positive. Three\norgans (2 kidneys and a liver) were transplanted to 3 distinct recipients.\nFurther blood tests routinely performed in 2 other laboratories that\ncollect and analyze blood samples for tissue storing in tissue banks\nshowed that these organs were taken from an HIV-infected donor. One\nof the laboratories carried out further analysis of the donor's blood\non the same day the 3 transplants were performed. The tests included\nthe nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT) to detect hepatitis C\nand B virus (HCV and HBV) and HIV. The results obtained 2 days later\nwere sent on the morning of the following day (a Saturday) by fax\nonly (and not communicated by phone as they should be) to the\nlaboratory of the hospital where the organs had been taken for\ntransplant. As a result, the director of this laboratory only\nreceived the message the following Monday morning, 5 days after the\noperations had taken place. He immediately alerted the regional\ntransplant organization. The delay in communicating this event was\ndeclared by the Italian transplant network to be a violation of the\nnational and regional guidelines that demand the prompt alert of the\nentire system.\nThe 3 organ recipients were informed of the possibility of being\ninfected with HIV on the same day that the donor's HIV status was\nrevealed to the transplant organization network. An international\ntask force comprised of leading experts in infectious diseases has\nsince taken responsibility for the treatment of the 3 patients. While\nawaiting the results of the genotyping, the patients received HAART\n(Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy), taking into account the\nexisting risk of organ rejection. All 3 have since tested positive\nfor HIV, but the public health authorities stated that it would take\nabout one year to be able to make a general commentary on their\nhealth condition.\nThe accident, unprecedented in Italy's 40-year history of organ\ntransplantation, was concluded to be entirely due to human error and\nnegligence of procedures and guidelines [1].\nThe Italian Ministry of Health, the National Transplant Centre and\nthe regional authorities appointed a commission of experts to\nevaluate the accident, reassess the procedures and propose possible\nprecautionary measures.\nThe authorities of the region involved in the event proposed the\nintroduction of the following precautionary measures when testing\ndonors' blood for viruses (HIV, HCV, HBV):\n(1) Cross-checking the virology analysis reports to ensure that the\ntranscription of test results is confirmed by double signature;\n(2) Using computerized procedures for the transfer of test results\nfrom the laboratory equipment to the laboratory data-processing\nmanagement system (for example, medical records), eliminating the\nmanual transcription of data;\n(3) Using clearly visible computerized graphic symbols to underline\nthe organ donor suitability;\n(4) Including the number of antibodies and the related positivity\nthreshold besides the viral negative/positive result;\n(5) Activating dedicated laboratory structures and accreditation or\ncertification paths in order to improve quality standards.\n[By E.

The number of HIV-infected children in the\nSouthern Kazakhstan region has risen to 91 [up from 72 in early\nOctober 2006 - Mod.CP]. The children are former patients of local\nhospitals, in the age range one to 5 years old. Eight of them have\nalready died. Thirteen of their mothers who were also treated in\nlocal hospitals have also become infected [up from 7 in October 2006\n- Mod.CP].\nIt is presumed that this extensive transmission of HIV infection was\na consequence of transfusion of contaminated blood. An alternative\nexplanation is that disposable instruments and syringes were reused\nby medical staff without adequate sterilization. The most recent 2\ncases of HIV infection of children were detected literally days after\nscreening of adults who had been in contact with infected patients.\nCurrently, the entire population of the district (oblast) is being\nscreened to detect cases of HIV infection. In the regional centre,\nthe city of Shymkent, since the middle of January [2007], a legal\nprocess has been underway to investigate the possible criminal\nnegligence of medical staff. In total, 21 employees of local medical\nestablishments are being prosecuted.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It is to be hoped that the legal process underway in Shymkent will\nestablish the source of this distressing incident and the precise\nmode of transmission of HIV and that adequate compensation will be\nforthcoming.\nA map of Kazakhstan showing the location of Shymkent in the extreme\nsouth of the country can be viewed at\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kazakhstan_pol01.jpg>.\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2006\n----\nHIV, nosocomial transmission - Kazakhstan 20060920.2689\nHIV, nosocomial transmission - Kazakhstan (02) 20061007.2884\n.........................np/cp/msp/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Statistics have\nshown that around 40 million people worldwide are living with\nHIV/AIDS.\nAlthough monkeys in Africa infected with simian immunodeficiency\nvirus (SIV) are said to be the source of 2 of the 3 strains of the\nvirus [HIV] in humans the source of the 3rd has been unknown, until\nnow. Martine Peeters, a virologist at the University of Montpellier\nin France said, \"It is the first time that someone has done a survey\namong wild gorillas to see whether they were infected with an SIV.\"\nShe added: \"We showed they were infected and moreover they are\ninfected with a virus that is closely related to HIV-1 and a\nparticular variant O.\"\nHumans are believed to have become infected with HIV when they\nslaughtered infected chimpanzees for food. Around 25 million people\nhave died of HIV/AIDS since the virus was identified a quarter of a\ncentury ago. Three strains or groups of HIV -- M, N and O have been\nidentified. Group M is the most common strain and has spread around\nthe globe. Strain N is linked to a few cases in Cameroon and group O\nrepresents about one percent of HIV/AIDS cases in Cameroon and\nsurrounding countries. \"It is only there that we find it,\" Peeters\nexplained, referring to the O strain.\nShe and her colleagues have collected and analyzed hundreds of\ndroppings from wild gorillas and chimpanzees living in remote forest\nareas in Cameroon. The animals are hunted for food and medicines even\ntoday. An analysis of the samples showed the gorillas were infected\nwith a strain of SIV related to the O group. The infected gorillas\nlived nearly 400 kilometres (250 miles) apart so the scientists\nbelieve it is likely SIV infection is endemic in the animals.\nPeeters, who reported the findings in the journal Nature, said, \"We\nhave discovered it in gorillas but we think the primary reservoir is\nstill chimpanzees. We think chimpanzees transmitted it to gorillas\nbut we don't know who transmitted it to humans -- the gorilla or the\nchimp.\"\nHow the gorillas became infected in the first place is still a\nmystery because gorillas are vegetarians and encounters with\nchimpanzees are thought to be rare.\n--\nMary Marshall\n<tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>\n[The HIV-1 group O virus is responsible for about one percent of\ncurrent human HIV cases in Cameroon. Until the investigation reported\nabove, group O had not been found in nonhuman primates. Peeters and\nher colleagues says it is still too early to say whether western\nlowland gorillas are a reservoir species or merely a carrier of the\nvirus.\nA map of West Central Africa showing the location of countries around\nCameroon can be accessed via\n<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>.\nThe paper referred to in the above report is published in the 9 Nov\n2006 issue of the journal Nature (Nature. 2006 Nov 9;444(7116):164.\n<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=Display&DB=pubmed>).\nThe paper is entitled: Human immunodeficiency viruses: SIV infection\nin wild gorillas; and is authored by Van Heuverswyn F, Li Y, Neel C,\nBailes E, Keele BF, Liu W, Loul S, Butel C, Liegeois F, Bienvenue Y,\nNgolle EM, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Delaporte E, Hahn BH, Peeters M.; at\nUMR145, Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement and Department of\nInternational Health, University of Montpellier 1, 34394 Montpellier\nCedex 5, France.\nThe Abstract reads as follows: \"Chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes\ntroglodytes_) from west central Africa are recognized as the\nreservoir of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpzPtt) that have\ncrossed at least twice to humans: this resulted in the AIDS pandemic\n(from human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 group M) in one instance and\ninfection of just a few individuals in Cameroon (by HIV-1 group N) in\nanother.

Govind\nSarda's company had used genuine blood-test kits as a decoy to\nhoodwink the government into handing it the supply contract, health\nofficials and police say.\n\"The samples they sent for testing were cleared by the expert\ncommittee as there was nothing wrong with them. But kits in the final\nconsignments were past their use-by dates,\" a police officer said.\nFears have been expressed that thousands of units of contaminated\nblood could have been given to recipients as the faulty kits might\nhave failed to detect infections.\nA member of the Sarda family who called up The Telegraph denied the\nallegations, but revealed Monozyme India had bagged the contract by\nquoting Rs 20 [USD 0.45] for a kit against its rivals' Rs 60-70 [USD\n1.35-1.57]. Monozyme had won the contract in December 2004 after the\nWest Bengal State AIDS Control and Prevention Society (WBSACPS)\nfloated the tenders. Since then, the company has supplied lakhs [one\nlakh is equal to 100 000. - Mod.CP] of kits meant for detecting\ninfections -- such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B\nvirus or hepatitis C virus -- in collected blood. Up to August 2006,\nit had supplied the government over 140 000 kits for testing for\nhepatitis B and C virus infections, health officials said.\nThe Sarda family member, however, claimed that Monozyme got the\ncontract only in November 2005 and had supplied only about 1000 kits.\n\"We started supplying in Bengal in January 2006. The order was\nrenewed a few months later. We have supplied around 1000 kits to\nWBSACPS, none of which had passed the expiry date,\" said the caller\non condition of anonymity.\n\"We got the licence for the kits in mid-2005, and the first\nconsignment was imported about 18 months ago. These kits have a shelf\nlife of 2 years; so the question of supplying kits past their use-by\ndate doesn't arise.\" But investigating officers said they had seized\nnearly 100 000 kits supplied by Monozyme that had passed their expiry\ndates. \"Some of the kits were supplied way back in 2005,\" an officer said.\nThe police have revealed that the cartons in which the kits came\nmention 2007 as the expiry date, but the boxes inside simply state\n\"005.\" The use-by date on the test pouches inside the boxes is either\nmissing or smudged. Investigators are probing how the faulty kits\ncleared screenings at the Central Blood Bank in Maniktala and the 6\nother centres from where blood is distributed. \"Since the WBSACPS had\ncleared the kits, we used them in good faith,\" an official at a\ndistribution centre said. Health department officials, however, said\nchecking the use-by date is standard practice.\n[Byline: Sanjay Mandal and Imran Ahmed Siddiqui]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 25 Oct 2006\nFrom: T Jacob John <vlr_tjjohn@sancharnet.in>\nSource: The Telegraph, Calcutta, Wed 25 Oct 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061025/asp/frontpage/story_6913612.asp>\n\nAs he read today about Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's clean chit to the\nhealth department in the blood-test kit scam, a lab technician would\nhave been reminded of the feeling he had 17 months ago. \"This can't\nbe true,\" he had then thought, giving the blood test report in his\nhand one more perplexed scan at NRS Medical College. It said the\nsample had tested negative for hepatitis B and C viruses. Yet the\ndark yellow blood serum had clearly pointed to hepatitis. The A and E\nforms had already been ruled out and B and C were the remaining\npossibilities. But the blood tests, done with a kit supplied by\nGovind Sarda's Monozyme India, were negative for both.\nCertain that there was something wrong with the kit, the technician\nhad reported the matter to his senior, who got in touch with the West\nBengal State Aids Prevention and Control Society [WBSAPCS], which had\napproved the kits. This was in May 2005, 16 months before the police\nrecorded the first complaint about the kits, past their expiry dates.\nOver the next few months, complaints poured in from other government\nhospitals too, sources said. Apart from the WBSAPCS, there were calls\nto the state health department and state drug controller.\n\"An impression has been created as if the health department knew\nabout the matter and wanted to keep it under wraps,\" Bhattacharjee\nhad said yesterday. \"This is totally false.\"\nFor over a year before the police got on the case, \"we had been\nreceiving complaints from blood banks in city government hospitals,\"\nadmitted a health official.\nThe complaints were the same. \"We told the health department there\nwas something amiss with the kits,\" a doctor at SSKM hospital said.\n\"But they didn't react.\" Things got moving only on 1 Sep 2006, when 2\nMonozyme employees spilled the beans. Why did the health authorities\nnot react? Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: \"Our department\nwas the first to lodge a complaint with the police about the\ndefective kits.\" The chief minister had echoed this. But the drug\ncontroller lodged the complaint with the police only on 27 Sep 2006,\nwhen the probe was already on.\n[Byline: Sanjay Mandal and Imran Ahmed Siddiqui]\n******\n[3]\nDate: Fri 27 Oct 2006\nFrom: T Jacob John <vlr_tjjohn@sancharnet.in>\nSource: The Telegraph, Calcutta, Fri 27 Oct 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061027/asp/frontpage/story_6922552.asp>\n\nPolice detectives today surprised Ghanshyam Sarda, brother of kit\nscam accused Govind Sarda, at the airport, arresting him as he tried\nto catch an early morning flight out of town. The police said\nGhanshyam had been managing director of Monozyme India between June\n2005 and July 2006 when the faulty blood-test kits were supplied, and\nhad full knowledge of the company's day-to-day functioning. The\n45-year-old had been on the run since elder brother Govind's arrest,\nsneaking in and out of the city on short trips from Delhi.\nPlainclothes detectives, lying in wait for him, spotted a smartly\ndressed Ghanshyam about to walk into the security zone around 5:40\nam, boarding pass in hand for a Jet Airways flight to Delhi.\nGhanshyam, too, spotted and recognised one of the officers and\nquickly made a U-turn, heading briskly towards the exit. But seeing\nthe detectives still coming after him, he gave up.\nThe businessman had turned up early at the airport and bought an\neconomy-class ticket using his credit card and giving his name as \"G.\nShyam,\" the police said. \"That he bought the ticket in a different\nname reveals his culpability. He should be able to throw some light\non the pricing of the kits and how they were branded and later\ndistributed,\" a senior officer said. Ghanshyam has been charged with\ncheating, forgery, activity leading to an epidemic and violating the\nDrug and Cosmetics Act. The police said 4 more arrests were likely,\nincluding that of the youngest Sarda brother, Jagdish, also in hiding.\nMonozyme's kits, supplied past their expiry date, are feared to have\nfailed to detect HIV, hepatitis B virus infection or hepatitis C\nvirus infection in blood-bank samples, possibly infecting thousands\nin Bengal. \"As a key functionary of the company, Ghanshyam was aware\nof everything (including) the decisions regarding kit distribution,\"\nsaid city detective chief Gyanwant Singh. The use-by dates on the\ncartons and the kit boxes inside did not match; and dates were either\nabsent or smudged on the pouches.

A large number\nof kits were seized today from 3 private diagnostic centres in\nKrishnagar, Malda and Cooch Behar, confirming fears that private\nclinics, too, had bought faulty kits from Monozyme.\n******\n[4]\nDate: Wed 8 Nov 2006\nFrom: T Jacob John <vlr_tjjohn@sancharnet.in>\nSource: The Pioneer online, Wed 8 Nov 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.dailypioneer.com/displayit1.asp?pathit=/archives2/oct1506/states/state1.txt>\n\nThe Health Department has been struggling to minimise the impact of\nthe biggest health scam to have struck the State [West Bengal] in\npast several decades. The scam is already threatening to extract a\nheavy price as far as the health of the citizens is concerned.\nAlthough Health Minister Suryakanto Mishra continued to keep his lips\nsewed, reports from his Secretariat said the Government is now trying\nto determine the extent of damage that may have been caused due to\ntransfusion of lakhs [100 000s] of infected units of blood that was\nchecked for purity with faulty kits over the last one year.\nThough Government sources refused to speak on official terms,\nunsubstantiated estimates suggested several thousand patients who\nhave received blood transfusions from elite Government hospitals\nincluding the 4 medical colleges in the city [Kolkata (Calcutta)] and\none postgraduate college as well as the central blood bank, could\nhave contacted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,\nhepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection or even\nvenereal diseases.\nIn a startling development the State police over the past fortnight\nmade repeated raids at the Government health facilities to recover\nhundreds of faulty 'detection kits' supplied by a well heeled\nbusinessman Govinda Sarda. The imported kits had either passed their\nuse-by dates or their expiry dates were tampered with, the police\nlater said adding the kits might well have found their ways into\nprivate health clinics or even smaller towns. The \"well connected\"\nbusinessman has been arrested.\nThough officials in the Health Department refused to specify,\nunconfirmed reports say already more than 200 cases of contamination\nhave been reported. Among them a good 10 per cent is HIV infected,\nsources said, hoping the number remains confined to a few hundred only.\nMeanwhile, the officials on Saturday said circulars have been issued\nto all the Government facilities not to use kits that have been\nsupplied to them since late in 2005. \"We are trying to detect the\nGovernment servants involved in the racket,\" was all that a senior\nhealth official had to say. At another level the CPM mandarins on\nSaturday denied the fact that the Minister's complacency and his poor\nrecord had played a hand in triggering the disaster.\n[Byline: Saugar Sengupta]\n--\nT Jacob John\n<vlr_tjjohn@sancharnet.in>\n[ProMED-mail is indebted to Professor T.

Letters have been sent to 1185 people treated in the West\nMidlands and Southampton over the last 6 years. A NHS spokeswoman\nsaid it was \"highly unusual\" to have a health worker contract both\ninfections. No patient who has had contact with the worker has been\ndiagnosed with the infections, but there is a \"small risk\" of\ntransmission, the spokeswoman said.\nNearly all the patients contacted were treated in the West Midlands,\nwith 24 people in the Southampton area also being notified. The\nrecalled patients are being asked to call confidential help lines and\nto attend clinics for blood tests. The worker in question worked in\northopedics at Redditch's Alexandra Hospital, Kidderminster Hospital,\nthe Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham, and Evesham Community\nHospital. A spokeswoman for the West Midlands Strategic Health\nAuthority said the worker had no symptoms and was unaware of the\ninfections. The symptoms were picked up by a recent occupational\nhealth assessment. Since that time, the worker has not been involved\nin any work that may place patients at risk.\nRegional public health director Dr. Rashmi Shukla said: \"This is a\nhighly unusual, if not unique, set of circumstances, in that the\nhealthcare worker is infected with both HIV and hepatitis B virus.\nHospitals have sent letters directly to all the patients who may be\naffected. There is no recorded case of transmission of HIV from an\ninfected health care worker to a patient in the UK, and the chance of\nan infected health care worker passing hepatitis B virus to a patient\nis low. However, there is a chance of infection, and I would\nrecommend patients to take the tests if they have received a\nnotification letter.\"\nDr. Sue Ibbotson of the Health Protection Agency said that, following\nnational guidelines, the worker would have been screened for\nhepatitis B virus infection when employed by the NHS [National Health\nService]. But she said no such guidelines existed for HIV screening.\nNew staff are asked whether they fall into a high risk category for\nthe virus. If they do, they are tested, but this test is a one-off,\nand is not repeated regularly during their employment, she added.\n--\nBrent Barrett\nIndianapolis, IN\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[The risk of transmission is remote in view of the specialty of the\nhealthcare worker involved and the absence of transmission of HIV\ninfection in a healthcare setting in the UK previously.

The government is seizing kits\nacross the country and has ordered a probe into the possible fraud,\nafter 2 brothers appeared in a Kolkata court on Mon [30 Oct 2006]\naccused of selling hundreds of thousands of blood-testing kits long\npast their expiration dates. Govind and Ghansyam Sharma, whose\ncompany Monozyme India has several contracts to supply the kits to\nthe government, deny charges of malpractice and forgery. Both are\nstill in police custody after being denied bail.\n\"The Kolkata police findings have a strong nationwide connection, and\nwe have ordered seizures of kits from every other state,\" said P K\nHota, who retired on Wednesday [1 Nov 2006] as India's Health\nSecretary. \"We will ... find out how many people have been infected\nby HIV or hepatitis and rectify the mistakes,\" he added.\nThe news follows a report published by Britain's Royal Society of\nMedicine that said that India dangerously underestimated the number\nof its estimated 5.7 million HIV-infected people who caught the virus\nthrough reused needles in hospitals and similar hygiene lapses. U.S.\nresearchers, writing in the society's International Journal of STD\n(sexually transmitted disease) and AIDS, said India is placing too\nmuch emphasis on preventing the sexual transmission of the virus.\nIndia says more than 80 percent of HIV-infected people caught the\nvirus while having sex, much of the time with prostitutes. The report\nsays these figures are inflated and are blinding India to preventing\nother routes of transmission.\nA tip-off from an employee at Monozyme resulted in police in the\neastern state of West Bengal, of which Kolkata is the capital,\nfinding more than 100 000 obsolete blood-test kits in blood banks\nacross the state. Monozyme India had supplied the kits, which are\nused to screen potential blood donors, to at least 9 other Indian\nstates, police in Kolkata said. Two other medical supply companies\nare now also under investigation suspected of similar fraud. There\nare already reports of people [contracting] HIV after receiving blood\nfrom donors who were wrongly given the all-clear.\nSailen Ghosh, secretary of the Thalassaemia (a blood disorder) and\nAIDS Prevention Society in Kolkata, told Reuters he knew of at least\n6 people who [had contracted] HIV in the last year after receiving\nroutine blood transfusions. Police said the number of people infected\nwith HIV and hepatitis after receiving badly screened blood could run\ninto thousands.\n[Byline: Bappa Majumdar]\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[A map of India showing the location of the state of West Bengal and\nKolkata (Calcutta) can be accessed at\n<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.gif>.\nTransmission of virus infection via blood transfusion is an\never-present risk that is usually a consequence of lack of\nunderstanding of the properties of the infectious agent. Only rarely\nis it due to criminal negligence. In the present case, it is unclear\nto what extent the Monozyme HIV and hepatitis (B, C or both?) test\nkits used to screen blood donations had exceeded their shelf-life.\nFrom the tone of the Reuters report, it seems likely that the test\nkits may have retained some activity and that there were other\ndeficiencies in the screening of donated blood for use in transfusion.\nProMED-mail would welcome information from a local source on the\noutcome of the prosecution proceedings, and the final apportioning of\nblame, in due course. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nCJD (new var.) - Netherlands: 2nd case 20060623.1741\n2005\n----\nCJD (new var.) update 2005 (06) 20050607.1584\nCJD (new var.) update 2005 (05) 20050505.1243\nCJD (new var.) - Netherlands: 1st case 20050422.1118\n2004\n----\nHepatitis C virus, blood supply - South Korea (02) 20040402.0900\n2003\n----\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan (02) 20031003.2492\nHepatitis B virus, blood transfusion, 2003 - Japan 20030914.2326\nHepatitis B virus, blood transfusion, 2000 - Japan (03) 20030826.2149\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan (02) 20030821.2098\nWest Nile virus update 2003 - Canada (12) 20030803.1900\nWest Nile virus update 2003 - USA (16) 20030718.1759\nWest Nile virus update 2003 - USA (15) 20030711.1706\n2002\n----\nDengue virus, transfusion transmission - China (HK) 20021011.5526\n1998\n----\nRift Valley fever - Uganda 19980222.0348\n.......................cp/msp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Only about a dozen cases\nhave been described in medical literature since the 1st one was\nfound, in London in 2003. But AIDS specialists in Brazil, India,\nAfrica, the Caribbean and elsewhere are reporting that some patients\non life-saving antiretroviral drugs are developing painful facial\nulcers or losing feeling in their fingers and toes. And in the\ndeveloping world, where 300 000 new cases of leprosy were discovered\nin 2005 and where 38 million are infected with the AIDS virus, the\nproblem will inevitably get worse, experts say.\n\"This is just the peak of the iceberg,\" said Dr. William Levis, who\ntreats leprosy patients at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. \"It's\nearly in the game. Most physicians don't even think about leprosy, so\nthere's probably much more around than we know.\"\nDr. Gilla Kaplan, a professor at the University of Medicine and\nDentistry of New Jersey and one of the 1st to study connections\nbetween AIDS and leprosy, agreed. Antiretroviral treatment, she said,\n\"is going to flush out the silent leprosy by making it symptomatic.\"\nBecause leprosy, a bacterial disease, can be treated with specialized\nantibiotics that are supplied free by the Novartis pharmaceutical\ncompany, there is little prospect of a worldwide epidemic or large\nnumbers of deaths. \"It's a matter of concern for the individual\npatients,\" said Dr. Denis Daumerie, who leads the efforts by WHO to\neliminate leprosy. \"It's not a matter of concern for public health.\"\nIn the mid-1980s, as it became clear that AIDS was not primarily a\ndisease of gay American men but was killing millions of people --\nmen, women and children in poor countries -- many public health\ndoctors prophesied that it would be a double disaster for those with\nleprosy. It seemed a logical assumption, since leprosy is caused by a\ngerm from the same family of waxy-walled bacteria as those that cause\ntuberculosis and _Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare_, 2 major\nkillers of AIDS patients. But it proved a false alarm.\n\"People expected a big surge in leprosy, but it didn't happen,\" said\nDr. Diana N. Lockwood, a leprosy expert at the London School of\nHygiene and Tropical Medicine. When the predictions did not come\ntrue, she said, \"we assumed that co-infected people just died before\ntheir leprosy became manifest.\" The incubation period for the most\neasily diagnosed form of leprosy is 8 to 13 years, while the\nincubation period for AIDS is 8 to 10.\nBut leprosy in people known to have been already infected did not\nseem to worsen when those patients developed AIDS too, showing that\nthe 2 diseases can apparently coexist without reinforcing each other.\nSo it came as a shock to doctors when AIDS treatment caused hidden\ncases of leprosy to appear.\nThe 1st such patient described in a medical journal was Dr.\nLockwood's, a Ugandan exile in London who was being treated for both\ntuberculosis and AIDS, and suddenly developed a swollen lesion on his\nface. \"It took us a while to realize it was leprosy,\" Dr. Lockwood\nsaid. \"Since then, we've seen more cases in people from Brazil and India.\"\nDepending on symptoms, leprosy is often initially misdiagnosed as\narthritis or lupus. Painful facial lesions, which are less common,\ncan have many causes; in the Ugandan man's case, doctors said, his\nimmune system probably formed nodules around bacteria next to a facial nerve.\nDr. Michael S. Glickman, a bacteriologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering\nCancer Center who treated the only co-infected case known in New\nYork, said he too had some difficulty diagnosing his patient's leprosy.\nDr. Glickman's patient, a man from Burkina Faso, was suffering from\nadvanced AIDS when he 1st saw Dr. Glickman 6 years ago, with a CD4\ncell count below 10 (normal is 500 or more). As the patient recovered\non antiretroviral therapy to a CD4 count of 600, he developed a\nlighter-colored patch of skin. Dr. Glickman noticed that it was\nslightly numb to the touch. Fortunately, he had once visited Dr.\nLevis's clinic at Bellevue, and made the connection. \"It was so\nunremarkable that, if I hadn't seen leprosy patients, I wouldn't have\nknown what it was,\" he said.\nTreatment in cities like New York and London is relatively easy, but\nthe real crisis, experts said, will evolve in poor countries with\ndual epidemics. In French Guiana, for example, Dr. Pierre Couppie,\nchief of dermatology at the Central Hospital in Cayenne, said he\nbelieved that about one in every 500 AIDS patients would develop\nleprosy lesions soon after starting treatment.\nBrazil has the world's highest per-capita leprosy rate and also one\nof the most effective AIDS treatment programs in the developing\nworld, and 7 Brazilian cases have been mentioned in medical\nliterature. No countrywide study has been done, but Dr. Patricia D.\nDeps, a leprosy expert at the Federal University of Espirito Santo in\nBrazil, said it was \"becoming more and more common.\"\n\"We don't have good numbers, but we think about 2 percent of the\nleprosy cases in Brazil are co-infected with HIV,\" Dr. Deps said. The\ncountry that most worries experts is India. Not long ago, it had 70\npercent of the world's leprosy cases. Its official caseload is a bit\nof a mystery now. After an aggressive 20 year campaign to find and\ntreat new cases, India officially declared leprosy \"eliminated as a\npublic health issue\" in 2005. However, that statement was carefully\ncrafted: it means there is a national average of lower than one case\nper 10 000 citizens, which could be as many as 100 000 new cases a year.\nAt the same time, with about 5.2 million people infected with the\nAIDS virus, India is poised to outstrip South Africa as the country\nwith the most AIDS victims. But its epidemic began much later than\nSouth Africa's or Brazil's, and it has been slow to roll out AIDS\ntreatment. As treatment grows, leprosy may surge along with it. Other\ncountries with high numbers of leprosy victims are Myanmar,\nMadagascar, Nepal and Mozambique.\nDoctors have long known that dormant diseases can surge as a weak\nimmune system recovers. The recovering immune system regains its\nability to create fevers, flood infected tissue with white blood\ncells, break bacteria down into toxic waste products and build\nnodules around bacteria it cannot kill.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[What the posting describes -- a paradoxical exacerbation of disease,\nwhen, due to antiviral therapy, an HIV-infected patient's CD4 cell\ncount rises -- is usually referred to as an immune reconstitution\ninflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or immune reconstitution reaction. IRIS\nis not necessarily related to ongoing infection per se but can be due\nto an immune system that has \"woken up\" and is now reacting, for\nexample, to residual bacterial (such as _M. avium-intracellulare_),\nviral (such as cytomegalovirus) or fungal (such as _Cryptococcus\nneoformans_) antigens.\nWhether these reactions described in the posting as occurring after\nthe initiation of antiviral therapy represent an IRIS is not entirely\nclear. As summarized by Diana Lockwood's group in a review in Lancet\nInfectious Diseases (1), some individuals (they review 9 such cases)\ndevelop post-HAART reactions as described in the posting, which are\nsimilar in most cases to the so called Type 1 \"reversal\" reactions\nthat are associated with activation of T-cell reactivity to _M.\nleprae_ antigens, CD4 cell migration into the lesions and production\nof Th1-type cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, IL-2 and IL-12.\nThese type 1 reversal reactions can occur after the institution of\ntherapy for _M. leprae_.\nIt is important to note, however, that these reactions have now been\ndescribed in _M. leprae_/HIV co-infected individuals who have not\nbeen treated with antiviral medications. In an in-press manuscript\n(2) from Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2 such cases are reported that cannot be\nclassified as IRIS in origin. These reactions, in a setting of very\nlow CD4 cell population, underscore the real paradox previously\nrecognized and now discussed by Lockwood's group.\nThe paradox relates to the observation that, despite dramatic effects\nof HIV/AIDS infection on the clinical manifestations and\nhistopathological findings of _M. tuberculosis_ infection, there is\nno such effect with _M. leprae_. Even in individuals with profoundly\nlow CD4 levels who are HIV/_M. leprae_ coinfected, there are\ngranulomas formed in tuberculoid leprosy and the number of CD4 cells\nin the granuloma were no different than in cases without HIV (3). The\nunderlying mechanism for this dramatic difference is discussed at\nlength in the Ustianowski paper (1) and may be related to differences\nin the mechanism of granuloma formation in the 2 mycobacterial\ninfections, or compartmentalization of the cellular immune response,\nbut still has to be clearly established.\n1.

Previously 83 blood\nsamples had undergone additional testing there: 72 were confirmed positive\nand 8 only were negative.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[On 20 Sep 2006 ProMED-mail reported that 55 children had been diagnosed\nHIV-positive (see: HIV, nosocomial transmission - Kazakhstan\n20060920.2689). According to the latest information supplied by the Kazakh\nNews Agency \"Gazeta.kz\" <http://www.gazeta.kz/art.asp?aid=81607>, the\nnumber of infected children in the south Kazakhstan region has risen to 75\nas of Thu 5 Oct 2006.\nYerbolat Dosaev, the Minister of Health of Kazakhstan, has confirmed that\nthe large number of pediatric cases in the South Kazakhstan Region was a\nconsequence of poor standards of hygiene during blood transfusion, the\nre-use of disposable equipment, and shortcomings in the system for\nregistering blood donors.\nThe precise circumstances of this escalating epidemic of HIV infection in\nchildren in the South Kazakhstan Region are not fully identified in this\nand the preceding report, apart from general deficiencies in health care in\nSouth Kazakhstan and an association with blood transfusion and injections.\nIt may be that the practice of transfusing red blood cells to sick children\nin order to combat anaemia may have continued locally in South\nKazakhstan. If blood is transfused without adequate testing for\nblood-borne pathogens, there is a risk of transmission of HIV and other\nagents. Likewise the re-use of inadequately sterilised needles and\nsyringes could contribute to the spread of blood-borne infections.\nA map of Kazakhstan, a country of 15 million people extending from the\nplains of western Siberia to the deserts of Central Asia, can be accessed\nvia <http://www.blythe.org/afghan-maps/kazakhstan_map.jpg>. - Mods.NP/MPP/CP]\nSee Also\nHIV, nosocomial transmission - Kazakhstan 20060920.2689\n2005\n----\nHIV/AIDS: United Nations Report 20050603.1544\nAnnouncements 2005 (02): Free HIV training from ISID 20050325.0865\n2004\n----\nHIV/AIDS, global epidemic escalates 20040706.1814\n2003\n----\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan (02) 20031003.2492\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan 20031002.2475\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan (02) 20030821.2098\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan 20030730.1871\nHIV-1: origin & history 20030614.146\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n----\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\n.........................np/cp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

NBCA [News\nBriefing Central Asia] analysts say the scandal undermines public\nconfidence in the medical services. The existence of an HIV outbreak\nin South Kazakhstan has been public knowledge for 3 months, and the\nmedia have covered it in some detail. But news that the figure had\nclimbed to 55 came in an announcement by Kazakh health minister\nYerbolat Dosaev on Mon 18 Sep 2006. Health experts say this figure\ncomes close to epidemic proportions.\nThe minister indicated that the mass infections were caused by poor\nhygiene standards during blood transfusions, the re-use of disposable\nequipment, and shortcomings in the system for registering blood\ndonors. The Kazakh authorities have launched a criminal case under a\nprovision making it illegal to infect others with HIV. Checks are\nbeing run on hospital staff, and Nursulu Tasmagambetova, the head of\nthe South Kazakhstan region's health department, has stepped down.\nNone of these actions have so far helped identify those responsible\nfor allowing the HIV infection, or to find out what the source of the\noutbreak is, and more cases are continuing to be diagnosed. The\ndiagnosis of so many children as HIV-positive has made this a hugely\npolitical case, and some members of Kazakhstan's parliament are\nalready calling for the health minister's resignation.\nSome NBCA [News Briefing Central Asia] analysts believe the case\nshould serve as a wake-up call for a profoundly flawed healthcare\nsystem. For instance, they assert that corruption flourishes from top\nmanagement down to the lowliest medical staff selling off syringes\nand medicines on the side. And as long as healthcare employees remain\namong the worst paid workers in the country, negligence is going to\nbe a problem. Even the government's hasty allocation of more than 53\nmillion US dollars for an HIV/AIDS program running from 2006 to 2010\nmay not be enough to redress matters, say the analysts. One of the\ngravest consequences of this scandal, say NBCA analysts, is that\npeople's trust in state healthcare provision will be left badly shaken.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 20 Sep 2006\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Moscow Times [edited]\n<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/09/21/017.html>\n\nKazakh Health Minister Fired for HIV Infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nKazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Wednesday [20 Sep 2006]\nsacked the country's health minister and the governor of a southern\nregion after 55 toddlers were infected with HIV while receiving\nmedical treatment.\nNazarbayev fired Health Minister Erbolat Dosayev and South Kazakhstan\nregion Governor Bolat Zhylkyshiyev for \"serious shortcomings in their\nwork,\" deputy Security Council chief Nurlan Abdirov said.\nAbdirov said the dismissals were linked to 55 young children\ncontracting HIV while receiving treatment, including blood\ntransfusions and injections, at the regional children's hospital in\nthe city of Shymkent.\nThe 1st cases of HIV among children less than 3 years old in the city\nwere reported this summer.\nNearly 5000 children under 3 who were treated at the hospital and had\ncontact with the infected children have been tested. More than 4000\nothers are to be examined.\nOfficials said prosecutors were investigating and that any medical\nstaff found to be responsible for the infections would face criminal charges.\nAbdirov said Wednesday [20 Sep 2006] that Nazarbayev would personally\nsupervise the investigation.\nAuthorities are looking for 17 donors who are suspected of carrying\nthe virus that causes AIDS, and whose blood had been used at the\nhospital, according to the Health Ministry.\nThe ministry has said the infected children would be provided with\ntreatment free of charge and that their families would receive financial aid.\nAccording to health officials, Kazakhstan recorded 828 new HIV\ncarriers and 70 AIDS patients in the 1st 6 months of this year\n[2006], a 70 percent increase in new cases over 2005.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The precise circumstances of the escalating epidemic of HIV\ninfection in children are not fully discussed in the reports above,\napart from general deficiencies of the health care system in South\nKazakhstan. Such apparent outbreaks of HIV in children elsewhere have\nbeen associated with the abandonment of children by their parents and\ntheir subsequent upbringing in poorly resourced institutions.\nThe newswires seem to suggest there may be an association with blood\ntransfusions and injections. A common practice in the not too\ndistant past was to transfuse red blood cells to ill children to\nimprove upon anemia that may have been secondary to other causes such\nas malaria in malaria zones and malnutrition. If blood is transfused\nwithout adequate testing for blood borne pathogens, the risk of\ntransmission of HIV and hepatitis (B and C) is there. The mention\nthat this may have been associated with injections alone is further\ndisturbing as it suggests that syringes and needles were being reused\nwithout adequate sterilization.\nA map of Kazakhstan, a country of 15 million people extending from\nthe plains of western Siberia to the deserts of Central Asia, can be\naccessed via\n<http://www.blythe.org/afghan-maps/kazakhstan_map.jpg>. - Mods.CP/MPP]\nSee Also\n2005\n----\nHIV/AIDS: United Nations Report 20050603.1544\nAnnouncements 2005 (02): Free HIV training from ISID 20050325.0865\n2004\n----\nHIV/AIDS, global epidemic escalates 20040706.1814\n2003\n----\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan (02) 20031003.2492\nHIV, contaminated blood - Japan 20031002.2475\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan (02) 20030821.2098\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan 20030730.1871\nHIV-1: origin & history 20030614.146\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n----\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\n..............................mpp/cp/msp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The man (i.e., the index\npatient) had no history of antiretroviral treatment and reported\nhaving sex with multiple named and anonymous male partners, using\ncrystal methamphetamine, and engaging in unprotected insertive and\nreceptive anal intercourse. He had rapid progression to acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after experiencing signs and\nsymptoms of acute HIV infection. The case was reported to the New\nYork City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOH) in late\nJanuary 2005 and has been described previously (1).\nThis report describes the public health investigation of the index\npatient's reported contacts and a review of viral genetic sequencing\n(genotype) results from other HIV-infected patients in the NYC region\nto estimate the prevalence of this strain of HIV. The investigation,\nconducted by NYCDOH, Connecticut Department of Public Health, Aaron\nDiamond AIDS Research Center, New York State Department of Health,\nand CDC, identified 3 other patients with similar risk factors who\nengaged in high-risk sexual activity at the same time and in the same\nvenues as the index patient and who were infected with a\ngenotypically homologous strain of HIV. The findings demonstrate the\nusefulness of population-based reporting of HIV genotyping data to\nidentify exact matches of new HIV mutations associated with drug\nresistance and to determine their characteristics and public health\nimportance. The findings also demonstrate the continued risk for HIV\ntransmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) through high-risk\nbehaviors and the need to find effective methods to prevent HIV\ntransmission in this population.\nCase Report\n---------\nThe index patient had tested negative for HIV infection in May 2003\nand reported no history of treatment with antiretroviral drugs\n(ARVs). In early November 2004, he experienced onset of persistent\nfever, fatigue, and pharyngitis. In mid-December 2004, he tested\npositive for HIV-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and\nWestern blot. The patient's HIV infection progressed rapidly to AIDS\nduring a period of 4 to 20 months (1); his exact date of infection\nwas unknown. His CD4 T lymphocyte count decreased from 80 cells/uL on\n29 Dec 2004, to 28 cells/uL on 19 Jan 2005. His plasma HIV RNA levels\nranged from 100 000 to 650 000 copies/mL during January 2005 (2).\nGenotypic analysis of the viral polymerase (pol) gene predicted that\nthe patient's virus was resistant to most agents in 3 classes of\nARVs: nucleoside or nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and\nprotease inhibitors. Phenotypic drug-resistance testing indicated\nthat the strain was susceptible to enfuvirtide and efavirenz. The\nvirus was subtype B; the viral population was relatively homogeneous,\nwith an average intrasample diversity for the p17 and V3 regions\nranging from 0.4 percent to 1.7 percent. The virus was dual tropic\nand had replication capacity 36 percent greater than wild-type HIV\nstrains. The patient tested negative for all known genetic\nhost-susceptibility factors associated with rapid AIDS progression\n(e.g., presence of D32 homo- or heterozygosity, HLA A-B-C\nhomozygosity, or specific Class I and Class II alleles) (2,3).\nContact Investigation\n-----------------\nAfter the case was reported to NYCDOH, the index patient provided the\nnames and contact information for 14 sex partners during a standard,\nvoluntary, confidential interview. The named partners were contacted\nby NYCDOH in February 2005 and were offered HIV testing. Ten of the\n14 named partners had been reported previously to the NYCDOH HIV/AIDS\nregistry as seropositive. Eight of these 10 partners either had a\nrecent blood test for HIV genotype (i.e., within one year of the\nindex diagnosis) or consented to a new blood draw for genotyping.\nChart review indicated that all 10 named partners were clinically\nstable, and none had a genotype matching that of the index patient.\nOf the 4 partners who had not been previously reported to NYCDOH, one\ncould not be reached despite multiple attempts; the 3 others all\neither reported a recent negative HIV test or refused testing.\nLaboratory Reporting\n----------------\nIn response to this case, on 11 Feb 2005, NYCDOH requested that all\nphysicians and laboratories in NYC report patients with newly\ndiagnosed MDR HIV-1 and rapidly progressive disease. Laboratories\nconducting genotypic drug-resistance testing were asked to report all\ngenotypes identified during the period 1 Jun 2005 to 3 Jun 2005 that\nexhibited resistance to 4 or more nucleoside/nucleotide analogue\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors, one or more non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors, or 4 or more protease inhibitors. In\nresponse, laboratories reported 189 MDR genotypes, representing 134\npersons, of whom 121 had medical records available for review in NYC.\nAn attempt to match each person to those in the HIV/AIDS registry\nconfirmed that 116 persons had diagnoses of HIV infection before 1\nJan 2000; 5 had infections diagnosed during 2000-2004. Two of these\npatients (with infections diagnosed in 2001 and 2003, respectively)\nhad no record of ARV therapy in their charts; 2 others were on ARV\ntherapy before the MDR HIV-1 genotype was identified in the index\npatient in December 2004.\nDuring the period 11 Feb to 30 Jun 2005, health-care providers were\nencouraged to perform genotyping on all patients who tested newly HIV\npositive and to report by telephone any patients with newly diagnosed\nMDR HIV-1 infection who had never been treated with ARVs.\nIn the period February-March 2005, the 28 laboratories conducting HIV\ngenotyping on NYC residents were asked to match the pol genotype of\nthe index patient against the nucleotide sequences in their sequence\ndatabases. The index patient's pol genotype also was matched against\nsequence libraries at CDC, the New York State Department of Health\nWadsworth Center, 3 large commercial laboratories in the United\nStates, 2 laboratories in Canada, and one in Europe. Three male\npatients, one in Connecticut and 2 in NYC, had nucleotide sequences\nwith >95 percent homology to the index patient's pol sequence. The 3\npatients with matching genotypes were interviewed either by their\nprimary-care providers or by NYCDOH. Information from the interviews\nindicated a strong likelihood that the index patient and Connecticut\npatient had been sex partners. Although none of the 3 patients with\nmatching genotypes identified each other or the index patient by\nname, all reported engaging in sexual activity at the same events or\nvenues or at similar events attended by the index patient during the\npreceding 2 years. Both the Connecticut patient and the index patient\ndescribed a sex partner attending at least one of these events who\nresembled the other in terms of general appearance, occupation, and\nserostatus (self-reported). All 3 men with genotypes that matched the\nindex patient's genotype were clinically stable on ARV regimens at\nthe time of their interviews. Sufficient data were not available to\ndetermine the rate of disease progression before diagnosis of HIV\ninfection or initiation of ARV therapy in any of the 3 patients with\nmatching genotypes.\nSequencing\n--------\nConfirmatory sequencing of pol and additional portions of the genome\nwas conducted by 3 independent laboratories on new blood samples from\nthe index patient and the 3 patients with matching genotypes. This\ntesting confirmed the pol homology of the viruses and homology of\nother genomic regions. However, because of the incomplete\nepidemiologic information, a definite chain of transmission among\nthese 4 genotypically related cases could not be established.\n(Reported by: LV Torian, PhD, S Blank, MD, SE Kellerman, MD, TR\nFrieden, MD, New York City Dept of Health and Mental Hygiene; DD Ho,\nMD, M Markowitz, MD, D Boden, MD, PhD, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research\nCenter, New York City; MM Parker, PhD, S Philpott, PhD, New York\nState Dept of Health.

MT McKenna, MD, T Folks, PhD, W Heneine, PhD, Div of HIV/AIDS\nPrevention, National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STDs, and\nTuberculosis Prevention (proposed), CDC.)\nMMWR Editorial Note\n-------------------\nThis report describes the public health investigation surrounding a\npreviously reported case of MDR HIV-1 infection (1). The\ninvestigation was conducted to identify contacts of the index\npatient, to offer HIV testing and partner notification, and to search\nfor other persons with diagnosed HIV infection who shared the index\npatient's HIV genotype. Data obtained from interviews, laboratory\nmatching, and supplemental laboratory testing identified only 3\npersons as infected with strains of HIV similar to that of the index\npatient. As of 21 Jul 2006, the index patient and 2 of the patients\nwith matching genotypes were clinically stable and responding to\nARVs. The 3rd patient with a matching genotype was clinically stable\nand responding to ARVs through April 2005 but has since been lost to\nfollow-up; he had not been matched to the New York City Death\nRegistry as of 30 Jun 2006.\nInvestigators were not able to determine exactly when or how, during\nthe period May 2003 to December 2004, the index patient was infected,\nwhether transmission of the HIV strain to the index patient was\ndirect from one of the 3 patients with matching genotypes or indirect\n(i.e., passed through an unknown intermediate person), or whether the\nindex patient's viral genotype was from a single viral infection or\nfrom recombination or superinfection. The index patient had multiple\npartners, many anonymous, during the period in which he became\ninfected. The cluster of 3 patients with matching genotypes\nrepresents only cases detected through laboratory matching and only\nthrough 30 Jun 2005. At least 6400 HIV-infected MSM in NYC have never\nbeen tested for HIV, and many other persons with diagnosed HIV\ninfection have never had genotyping. Therefore, the actual prevalence\nof this or a similar MDR HIV genotype in NYC is unknown.\nThe index patient's HIV infection progressed to AIDS in <20 months;\nthe median period for transition to AIDS without treatment is 8 to 10\nyears (4). Available laboratory and medical records data were not\nsufficient to establish whether this viral genotype was associated\nwith rapid progression to AIDS. Accelerated progression to AIDS and\ntransmission of MDR HIV-1 have been reported previously, although not\nwith this combination of high-level resistance and rapid progression\n(5,6). Newly diagnosed MDR HIV in a sexually active MSM who had never\nreceived ARV treatment raises several public health concerns.\nApproximately 70 percent of the named partners of the index patient\nhad HIV infection, and the majority had other recent sexually\ntransmitted disease infections, indicating substantial potential for\ntransmission of HIV and possibly also MDR HIV. The findings in this\nreport, along with increasing syphilis rates, continuing gonorrhea\ntransmission, and the emergence of lymphogranuloma venereum in\nHIV-positive MSM, reflect a resurgence of unsafe sex among MSM. This\nbehavior also has been associated with increasing use of methamphetamine (7).\nThe genotype data collected by NYCDOH indicated a low prevalence of\nMDR genotypes among persons who had not been treated with ARVs and\nwho had HIV infections diagnosed during the period 1 Jun 2004 to 30\nJun 2005. Drug-resistant HIV compromises the effectiveness of\nstandard ARV regimens and can limit the treatment options available\nto persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection (6). Therefore, CDC has\nprovided funding to 4 city and 17 state health departments to conduct\ndrug-resistance surveillance on remnant sera obtained from all\npatients with newly diagnosed HIV infection (8). Provisional data\nfrom these areas indicate that as many as 15 percent of these\npatients are infected with an HIV strain that has mutations\nassociated with resistance to ARVs, and 3.2 percent have mutations\nassociated with resistance to 2 or more classes of such medications.\nCase reports such as the one described here and results from\nsurveillance of newly diagnosed, drug-resistant HIV infections\ncontributed to recent changes in HIV-1 treatment guidelines issued by\nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (9). These\nguidelines now recommend performing drug-resistance testing before\ninitiation of therapy in patients who have never received ARV\ntreatment. To reduce HIV-associated morbidity and mortality in the\nUnited States, public health officials should intensify measures to\nimprove early diagnosis, partner notification, and prevention\ncounseling for persons (particularly MSM) who are HIV positive and\nshould conduct population-based genotype surveillance to monitor the\nemergence of unusual strains of HIV, particularly those with\nmutations associated with ARV resistance (8,10).\nReferences\n-----\n(1) Markowitz M, Mohri H, Mehandru S, et al.

Either this individual had the misfortune to\nbe infected with a rare spontaneous HIV mutant resistant to all 3\nclasses of anti-retroviral drugs or the extensive use of\nanti-retroviral drugs in the community may have generated this\nunwelcome triple drug-resistant variant. It was feared that an\noutbreak of HIV infection and AIDS not amenable to treatment with\ncurrently available drugs might be in the offing.\nThe MMWR report describes the outcome of an exhaustive program of\ncontact tracing and HIV genotyping to explore the question of the\norigin and transmissibility of this multiple drug resistant strain of\nHIV. Data obtained from interviews, laboratory matching, and\nsupplemental laboratory testing identified only 3 persons in the New\nYork area as infected with strains of HIV similar to that of the\nindex patient. These 3 were putative contacts of the index case. As\nof 21 Jul 2006, the index patient and 2 of the patients with matching\ngenotypes were clinically stable and responding to ARVs.\nThese data do not elucidate the origin of the triple drug-resistant\nstrain, nor whether the index patient's viral genotype was from a\nsingle viral infection or a consequence of recombination or\nsuperinfection. They do indicate, however, that this HIV variant does\nnot appear to be endowed with enhanced transmissibility.\nNonetheless, ongoing surveys of a wider section of sexually active\nmales indicate that as many as 15 percent of patients are infected\nwith an HIV strain that has mutations associated with resistance to\nanti-retroviral drugs and that 3.2 percent have mutations associated\nwith resistance to 2 or more classes of such agents. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2005\n----\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City)(02) 20050216.0522\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (03) 20050222.0568\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (04) 20050225.0604\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) (05) 20050326.0876\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City)(06) 20050727.2177\n.........................mpp/cp/msp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Public-health\nofficials in New York City issued a warning because the patient apparently\nhad developed a virulent form of HIV --- the [virus] that causes AIDS --\nthat was resistant to virtually all drugs and caused a rapid destruction of\nthe man's immune system.\nThe original source of the infection is a patient in Connecticut who\ninfected the New York man during anonymous rectal intercourse at a sex club\nin the city on 22 Oct 2004. Within 3 months, the New York man was\ndiagnosed with HIV, and his CD4 blood-cell count --- a marker of the\nhealth of his immune system --- had been reduced to double digits. A CD4\ncount above 500 is considered normal for healthy individuals. Dr. Gary\nBlick, a private-practice physician in Norwalk, Conn., reported that his\npatient, identified as CT01, is the so-called \"Patient Zero\" --- the source\nof the New York man's infection.\nThe new HIV strain appeared to be multi-drug resistant, but Blick said the\nalarm may have been overblown, because his patient now has a stable\ninfection that is being controlled by 2 drugs. \"We want to emphasize that\nour patient is not rapidly progressing. Nor is that patient's life partner,\nwho is also infected with a similarly highly resistant strain, rapidly\nprogressing,\" Blick told United Press International at the 3rd\nInternational AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment.\nEven though New York health authorities said the strain was unknown, Blick\nsaid he knew the source was his patient just a few days later. He said he\nhad received an urgent call shortly after the alarm was sounded from\nQuest/Nichols laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. Their HIV database\nhad produced a 99.5 percent match between the New York man and one of\nBlick's patients, CT01. Blick later received another call from the lab that\nthere was a 98.5 percent match with CT01's partner, CT02. \"When an HIV\nstrain is only about 1 percent different from another, they are usually\nalmost identical,\" he said. HIV mutates so rapidly that 100 percent\nidentical strains are uncommon if the patients are tested at different times.\nThrough interviews with his patients and New York authorities, Blick put\ntogether the following scenario: On 20 Oct 2004, CT01 provided blood\nsamples that indicated a detectable viral load. The patient told Blick he\nhad missed a few doses of Fuzeon, an injected drug known generically as\nenfuvirtide. Fuzeon, which prevents entry of HIV into cells, is one of 2\ndrugs the 52-year-old man -- who has a long history of HIV infection -- can\nstill take because his viral strain is resistant to all other medications.\nThe only other drug that keeps the virus at bay is efavirenz (Sustiva), a\nnon-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, which prevents the virus\nfrom replicating. \"The only 2 drugs that are effective in the New York man\nare also Fuzeon and Sustiva,\" Blick said.\n2 days after visiting the doctor, CT01 and CT02 traveled to New York to\nengage in sex at a club. \"They thought all the people at the club were\nHIV-positive,\" Blick said. \"My patient is devastated that he infected the\nNew York man, whom he thought was already HIV-positive.\" At the club, CT01\nhad insertive anal intercourse with ejaculation into the New York man.\nCT02, a 41-year-old man who has lived with CT01 for 12 years, had insertive\nanal intercourse without ejaculation with the same man. 3 months later, the\nNew York man showed symptoms of recent infection and was seen at the Aaron\nDiamond AIDS Research Center. When his CD4 count was measured at 88 cells,\nthe alarm was sounded.\nBlick said, however, the New York man's use of crystal methamphetamine and\nhighly promiscuous lifestyle may be more of a factor in his low CD4 count\nthan the strain of virus. Marc Wainberg, professor of medicine at McGill\nUniversity in Montreal, said he thinks Blick is correct in identifying his\npatients as the source of the highly-publicized New York case. \"The\nevidence is very convincing that he has identified the patient who is the\nsource of this strain of disease,\" Wainberg told meeting attendees. He also\nagreed the New York man probably developed a rapidly progressing form of\nthe disease due to his frequent use of crystal meth, along with his\npromiscuity. \"Who knows what damage that drug does to a person's immune\nsystem,\" he said.\nThe New York man had sex with at least 10 other partners before he\ndiscovered he was infected. Blick said it is possible other infections with\nthat strain may show up later when those men are tested -- if they became\ninfected.\n[Byline: Ed Susman]\n--\nTorey Haydon\n<Teal414@aol.com>\n[Despite the multiple drug-resistance of this novel strain of HIV, there is\nno evidence so far to suggest that it has properties that endow it with\ngreater transmissibility than other strains of HIV, or that it is spreading\nwidely in the community. The initial rapid progression of the disease in\nthe New York patient appears to have been contained by treatment and was\nnot a direct consequence of the multiple drug resistance of this strain of\nHIV. Identification of the source of the infection of the index patient who\nsparked this concern will facilitate analysis of the relevance of multiple\ndrug resistance in the epidemiology of HIV.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report. \"In\nshort, AIDS is an exceptional problem which demands an exceptional\nresponse.\" More than 120 delegates are scheduled to address the all-day\nmeeting, many of them ministers or their deputies, to assess progress since\na 2001 special U.N. General Assembly session on HIV/AIDS.\nPrograms have succeeded in Brazil, which has the most successful AIDS\nprogram among developing nations. Cambodia and Thailand have shown\nsubstantial progress and several African nations as well as the Bahamas\nhave slowed the rate of infection, says the report Annan submitted to\ndelegates.\nBut only 12 percent of those who need treatment are receiving it. Effective\nprevention programs, counseling and testing services are the exception to\nthe rule and drugs still cost too much, the report said. And despite the\nmany programs and money spent, the epidemic has not been reversed. The 4.9\nmillion infections and 3.1 million AIDS deaths in 2004 were the highest to\ndate, Annan said. Some of the worst predictions have come to pass. Nearly\nhalf of the estimated 39.4 million people living with HIV, the virus that\ncauses AIDS, are women and girls, whether married or single, promiscuous or\nfaithful.\n\"The trend is that more young women are being infected than young men,\"\nThoraya Obeid, the head of the U.N. Population Fund, told a news conference\non Wed 1 Jun 2006. \"If they are married, they can't abstain. They are\nfaithful but the husband is not faithful,\" Obeid said. Women, she said,\nneed information, including how to use a female condom to protect themselves.\nMen and women between 15 and 24 years old are the hardest hit by the\npandemic. Obeid released a survey done by young people in a dozen\ncountries, most of whom said they had no voice in their nation's AIDS\npolicies. Others said programs needed to be comprehensive -- abstinence and\nsex education, young people talking to other adolescents as well as to\nintravenous drug users.\nThe world's largest donor for fighting AIDS is the United States, which\nspent $2.4 billion last year. But it is being pressured by conservative\nreligious groups toward abstinence-only programs and away from vulnerable\ngroups like prostitutes, homosexuals and drug addicts. Included in the U.S.\ncontribution is some $450 million, or 1/3 of the budget of the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria -- a powerful independent\norganization of governments, business and private groups, first proposed by\nAnnan 4 years ago. The new head of the group's policy and strategy\ncommittee is Randall Tobias, who runs the Bush administration's AIDS\nprogram. Some officials are worried that the fund will adopt U.S.\npositions, but others say such fears are groundless.\nWorldwide, the U.N. report says, some $8 billion will be available in 2005\nto implement programs in 135 low- and middle-income countries, a dramatic\n23 percent increase over the previous year. Of this amount, rich countries\nhave contributed some $6.7 billion, 6 times greater than the world spent in\n2001\n[Byline: Evelyn Leopold]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail does not normally post reports on HIV and AIDS, nonetheless\noccasionally it is necessary to put events and emerging diseases into\nperspective.

The report, compiled by MRC's Burden of\nDisease Research Unit, shows that mortality rates and causes of death\ndiffer in the country's 9 provinces but that HIV/AIDS was the leading cause\nof death overall. HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death in every province\nexcept the Western Cape.\nDebbie Bradshaw, co-author of the report and director of the disease unit,\nsaid the study employed several data-collection methods, including death\nnotification forms and census and household surveys.\nThe report says that the country is dealing with a \"quadruple burden of\ndisease,\" with communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries\nand HIV/AIDS playing large roles in mortality, according to the Star newspaper.\nAccording to official statistics, South Africa has the highest number of\nHIV-positive residents of any country worldwide. UN AIDS figures released\nin July 2004 showed that about 5.3 million HIV-positive people live in\nSouth Africa, with a possible range of between 4.5 million and 6.2 million.\nRecommendations\n---------------\n\"The high death rate due to HIV/AIDS highlights the urgency to accelerate\nthe implementation of a comprehensive plan for the treatment and prevention\nof HIV and AIDS,\" the report says. The authors recommend that provinces\nimprove access to health care services; promote active, healthy lifestyles;\nand ensure \"basic needs\" such as access to clean water and sanitation are\nmet, according to the Star. The report, which is the first to provide\nspecific causes of death for each province, also says the mortality\ninformation can help individual provinces respond to their particular\nhealth needs. Bradshaw said the report could serve as \"an important\nbenchmark\" against which to monitor progress and encouraged local officials\nto identify issues that need to be addressed in their areas.\nReaction\n--------\nSouth Africa's National Association of People Living with HIV/AIDS said it\n\"was not surprised at the high HIV/AIDS mortality rate,\" according to the\nStar newspaper. HIV/AIDS is a \"multifaceted problem\" that requires\nassistance from the government and business community to fight poverty and\nprovide antiretroviral drugs, according to NAPWA spokesperson Thanduxolo Doro.\nMark Heywood, a spokesperson for the South African HIV/AIDS treatment\nadvocacy group Treatment Action Campaign, said, \"These figures are just\ngoing to get worse and worse,\" adding, \"The deaths in 2000 were at the\nbeginning of a period of rapid HIV infection. More people have been\ninfected since then, and more people are going to be dying.\"\nHowever, Letitia Rispel, director of the health department in Gauteng\nprovince, said programs implemented since 2000 might have improved the\nsituation. \"These include the prevention of mother-to-child treatment,\nwellness programs and the antiretroviral rollout program,\" she said,\nadding, \"Only once we have taken these into account will we get a clear\npicture.\" South Africa's Department of Health said it would comment once it\nhad reviewed the report.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 21 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: UN Integrated Regional Information Networks (UIRIN, News, Wed 18\nMay 2005 [edited]\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/printable/200505180752.html>\n\nSouth Africa: Government Declines to Comment On New AIDS Report\n-------------------------------------------------\nThe South African health department has declined to comment on a startling\nnew HIV/AIDS report, arguing that the document has not yet been\n\"officially\" released.\nAccording to the Medical Research Council report on cause-specific death\nrates for each of the country's 9 provinces, AIDS was the number-one cause\nof death, except in the Western Cape, which has the lowest HIV prevalence\nfigures.

On Thursday, Mlambo-Ngcuka said mining companies had made\ncommitments to introduce measures on preventing and monitoring HIV/AIDS as\nwell as treatment programmes. The plans were expected to be introduced in\nthe 2nd quarter of 2005, she said.\nSouth Africa has the world's highest AIDS caseload, with 5.3 million\npeople, or an estimated one out of 5 adults living with HIV and AIDS,\naccording to United Nations figures. President Thabo Mbeki's government\nbegan rolling out free antiretrovirals in November 2003, under pressure\nfrom AIDS activists who went to court to win an order against the\ngovernment. At least 42 000 South Africans are receiving free\nantiretrovirals under the government's rollout program, but the key AIDS\nlobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign, is urging the government to\nspeed up the ARV rollout to make them available to 200 000 people by 2006.\n******\n[4]\nDate: Sat 21 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Xinhua News Agency, Tue 17 May 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.rednova.com/news/health/150586/aids_becomes_leading_killer_in_south_africa/>\n\nAIDS Becomes Leading Killer in South Africa\n-------------------------------------------\nSouth Africa's biggest killer is HIV/AIDS, which causes 1 in 3 deaths, the\nMedical Research Council (MRC) said in a report on cause-specific death\nrates for each of the 9 provinces issued here on Tue 17 May 2005. Estimates\nof HIV/AIDS mortality in Gauteng province, the economic center in the\ncountry, accounted for 33 percent of all deaths in 2000 -- one in 3 --\ncompared with 30 percent of all deaths nationwide, according to the report.\nCompiled by the MRC's Burden of Disease Research Unit, the report shows\nthat overall mortality rates and causes of death differ in the provinces,\nbut that HIV/AIDS is the leading killer across the board. \"These figures\nare just going to get worse and worse,\" Mark Heywood, spokesperson for the\nTreatment Action Campaign, said on Mon 16 May 2005.\nThe findings relating to HIV/AIDS deaths were consistent with other\navailable reports. The deaths in 2000 were at the beginning of a period of\nrapid HIV infection. More people have been infected since then and more\npeople are going to be dying.\nBut Dr. Letitia Rispel, head of department for the Gauteng Health\nDepartment, said it would be difficult to say what the situation would be\nnow without taking programs implemented since 2000 into account. \"These\ninclude the prevention of mother-to-child treatment [transmission?],\nwellness programs and the antiretroviral rollout program. Only once we have\ntaken these into account will we get a clear picture, \" he added.\nThe MRC report, which also looks at other causes of deaths in the various\nprovinces, shows that these varied from province to province. For women in\nGauteng, the main causes of death, excluding HIV/AIDS, are stroke, lower\nrespiratory tract infections, homicide, ischaemic heart disease, road\naccidents, TB, hypertensive heart disease, diarrhoeal diseases, septicemia\nand diabetes mellitus. For men, the 10 leading causes of death, excluding\nHIV/AIDS, are homicide and road traffic accidents, ischaemic heart disease,\nTB, lower respiratory infections, stroke, suicide, diarrhoeal diseases,\ndiabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThis differs from the 10 leading causes of death for Western Cape men. For\nthose, the 10 leading causes of death are homicide, HIV/AIDS, traffic\naccidents, TB, heart disease and stroke, cancer of the upper respiratory\ntract or lungs, suicide, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower\nrespiratory infections. For women in the Western Cape the main causes of\ndeath are HIV/ AIDS, TB, heart disease, stroke, traffic accidents,\nhomicide, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, breast cancer and lower\nrespiratory infections. And according to the report, Western Cape residents\nhave the highest life expectancy in the country, probably due to a\nrelatively low HIV infection rate.\n******\n[5]\nDate: Sat 21 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Statistics South Africa, 2002, Sat 21 May 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.mrc.ac.za/researchreports/statssa.htm>\n\n[The MRC Report discussed in the preceding reports is contained in the\ndocument referred to below.

A Task Team including the Departments\nof Health, Social Development, Home Affairs and the Medical Research\nCouncil provided technical support in the planning and implementation of\nthe study.\nIn 2004 the MRC released a report in which it was estimated that about 25\npercent of all deaths were due to HIV/AIDS. The Statistics South Africa\nstudy finds a lower percentage (9 percent) of deaths recorded as being due\nto HIV. A major reason for this difference is that these studies measure\ndifferent things.\nThe Statistics South Africa data reflect the information recorded on the\ndeath certificates. In the absence of HIV status of all deceased, death\ncertificates will tend to reflect immediate cause of deaths or, in the case\nof AIDS, the indicator conditions. The MRC approach, however, was to assess\nthe impact of HIV/AIDS as an underlying cause of death, based on the\nobserved excess mortality among young adults.\nThe MRC research team considers that the number of deaths attributable to\nHIV is the leading cause of death and plans to undertake further analysis\nof these valuable data as well as other data to refine the estimates of the\nactual impact.\nDr Debbie Bradshaw (DPhil)\nMRC Burden of Disease Research Unit\n22 Nov 2002\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail does not normally post reports on HIV/AIDS, but the magnitude\nof the problem in South Africa and the continuing reticence of the South\nAfrican Government require that the South African Medical Research Council\nReport be given wider exposure.

Earlier he had\ntested negative for HIV-1 antibodies on several occasions between\nSeptember 2000 and May 2003.\nHis illness progressed to AIDS within 20 months -- and perhaps as\nlittle as 4 months -- of infection. The case was first publicised at\na press conference in New York in February 2005 because of the\npossible public health implications of a rapidly progressing strain\nof HIV with multiple drug resistance, and then discussed at the 12th\nRetroviral Conference in Boston (see: BMJ 2005;330:498, 5 Mar).\nDetailed analysis of the virus showed that it was resistant to 3 of\nthe 4 major classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors, and protease inhibitors. Viruses usually become less\nvirulent when they acquire drug resistance. However, the replication\ncapacity of the patient's HIV-1 was 136 percent in comparison with a\nmedian of 100 percent derived from a large number of wild-type\nviruses. This indicated that, despite its multidrug resistance, the\nvirus replicated as well as most wild-type, drug-susceptible viruses.\nRapid progression to AIDS after acute HIV-1 infection has been\ndescribed previously, as has the transmission of multidrug-resistant\nviruses. However, Martin Markowitz, of the Aaron Diamond AIDS\nResearch Center at Rockefeller University, New York, and one of the\nauthors of the case report, said: \"The unique feature in this case is\nthe convergence of 2 uncommon factors: the transmission of a\nmultidrug resistant HIV-1 variant and the extremely rapid clinical\ncourse to AIDS.\" He said that the case was in the top 0.5 percent in\nterms of rapidity of disease if 12 months was assumed as the duration\nof his infection.\nViral sequence analysis indicated that the patient's virus was\nsubtype B, and the relative homogeneity of the viral population was\nconsistent with early HIV-1 infection. Phylogenetic analysis of a\nnucleotide sequence from the viral pol gene and from 30 newly\ninfected individuals and 5 reference HIV-1 strains showed that the\nviral sequence of the new case was unique. No match was found in the\ncenter's sequence database.\n\"Because of its unique features, this pol sequence is now being\ncompared with those in the database at the Los Alamos National\nLaboratory and in various commercial laboratories with the hope of\nfinding a closely related HIV-1 that might provide an epidemiological\nlink to this case,\" the report said. \"The rapid clinical course of\nthe patient's illness could be explained by the properties of his\nunique HIV-1 variant,\" Dr Makowitz said, adding that genetic studies\non the case were still under way.\nTreatment options for the patient are limited: enfuvirtide and\nefavirenz are the only 2 antiretroviral drugs that can provide full\nactivity against his virus. He has been started on a multidrug\nregimen, including enfuvirtide and efavirenz. Tracing of his sexual\ncontacts has also begun.\nAn accompanying editorial warned: \"This case serves as a reminder\nthat HIV remains a frighteningly versatile foe, one that can mutate\nto escape immune attack or to acquire drug resistance with surprising\nspeed. One lesson to be drawn from this case, therefore, is that\ndespite all the advances that have been made in understanding this\nvirus and all the progress that has been made in developing new\ndrugs, prevention remains the most effective strategy to combat HIV,\nespecially prevention efforts that target high-risk groups, such as\nmen who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, and sex workers\nand their clients.\"\n[Byline: Susan Mayor]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Despite the progress in characterization of the virus isolated from\nthe rapid onset/multidrug-resistant patient in New York City, the\nepidemiologic significance of this virus is still uncertain.\nPhylogenetic analyses have indicated that it is a unique virus, but\nthe lack of isolates from the patient's contacts does not allow any\nconclusion to be drawn about the potential of this virus to promote\nrapid progression to AIDS.

The individual was infected within the previous 20 months,\nsuggesting that the resistant virus had been transmitted relatively\nrecently. The virus strain has reduced susceptibility to drugs in 3 of the\n4 available classes currently available. In addition, there appears to have\nbeen a very short time interval between HIV infection and the onset of\nAIDS. No other cases of this particular strain of transmitted virus have\nbeen documented in New York. There is, however, very limited surveillance\nof this type currently undertaken in New York City.\nThis case is noteworthy for 2 reasons (2). Firstly, transmission of HIV-1\nresistant to drugs within 3 of the 4 available classes of anti-retroviral\ndrugs occurred recently, and secondly, disease progression was rapid.\nAlthough each of these occurrences is rare, they are both previously\ndocumented in the literature, and may be independent of each other.\nThe prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in the United Kingdom\n(UK) and the rest of Europe is assessed by surveillance of resistance in\ndrug-naive individuals, and also in those individuals with recent\ninfection, which is more comparable to the case described above. The UK HIV\nResistance Database recorded a prevalence of any form of transmitted\nresistance of 18 per cent within 2410 drug-naive individuals studied\nbetween 1996 and 2003, with 3 per cent infected with 3-class resistant\nvirus in 2002 (3). A similar data set from the Europe-wide CATCH study\nreported 10 per cent (of a population of 1633) with any form of resistance\nbetween 1998 and 2002 (4).\nThe largest data set from individuals with recent infection (thus allowing\nmore accurate estimation of time trends for transmitted resistance) comes\nfrom the Concerted Action on Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in Europe\n(CASCADE), a large collaboration of seroconverter cohort data. Of 453 such\nindividuals known to have been infected from 1987 to 2003, 12 per cent had\nany form of resistance at diagnosis, with a peak of 19 per cent in 1999.\nOnly 0.5 per cent were infected with 3-class resistant HIV (5). Since such\ncohorts allow follow-up of recruited individuals with a known time of\ninfection, it is possible to explore the impact of transmitted resistance\nin the absence of therapy on CD4 decline, as a surrogate for disease\nprogression. Such analysis of the UK Register of HIV Seroconverters over a\n5 year follow-up period showed no difference in disease progression between\nthose infected with resistant virus and those without (6). This suggests\nthat the rapid progression in the recent New York case was not necessarily\ndue to the resistance pattern of the infecting virus strain.\nTaken together, these data sets show that transmission of drug resistance\nis evident in the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe as a whole. Although\ninfection with such strains will compromise response to first line\nanti-retroviral therapy, there is little evidence to date, that such\ntransmission is itself associated with increased pathogenicity or faster\ndisease progression. Nevertheless, there exists a myriad of forms of HIV\nresistance. The possibility that particular resistant variants, currently\nat low frequency in the population, are more transmissible than others, or\nare more damaging cannot be excluded. In view of the ongoing transmission\nof HIV within Europe, such a possibility must be considered (7).\nIt is important to maintain large-scale population-based surveillance of\ntransmitted resistant viruses. In particular, linking such data to clinical\ncohort follow-up will be essential for the early detection of viruses that\nrespond poorly to anti-retroviral therapy and/or cause rapid disease\nprogression.\n(This article was adapted from reference 2 below.)\nReferences\n----------\n1.

More than a week later, it has not abated.\nOne group of scientists not involved in the research was quick to dismiss\nthe news as isolated to one man and unworthy of alarm. Other scientists\nsaid not enough research had been done to warrant a public health\nannouncement, and accused Dr Frieden of excessive haste. Gay activists\nworried that Dr Frieden's use of the announcement to emphasize safe-sex\npractices would set up gay men as culprits, reviving a concern as old as\nthe disease. Long-standing rivalries among top AIDS researchers resurfaced,\nand one of the researchers who discovered the possible strain was accused\nof using a test developed by a company to which he had close ties.\nTo those who expect government officials to keep diseases at bay, it might\nseem surprising that a public health announcement about a deadly virus\nwould be attacked, but AIDS is not like tuberculosis or polio. From the\nmoment that HIV was discovered, it caused political chasms and profound\ndisagreements among experts, and in recent weeks the virus seemed to be\nproving that it could still be treacherous and surprising, both as a deadly\ndisease and a political fuse.\n\"The old jealousies, rivalries and big egos,\" said Kevin Robert Frost, vice\npresident of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, when asked why the\nresponse was so furious. \"Scientists in general react negatively to news by\npress conference.\" At one level, the reaction illustrates the intense\ncompetition among scientists and their institutions to communicate new\nfindings and get credit, crucial in obtaining money to expand their\nresearch. Many experts have been involved in the field for years, and in\nsome cases their professional disagreements have developed into the\nanimosities and outright personal hatreds that are common in academia.\nNonetheless, scientists, skeptics by nature and training, have a\nfundamentally different role than public health officials, who often have\nto take emergency measures to stop the spread of disease.\nAs a result, some research scientists said the appearance of a possible\ndrug-resistant and virulent strain of the virus in one 46 year old man\nmeant little. The man's immune system might have been compromised by the\ncrystal methamphetamine he had taken, they said, or the virus could have\nrapidly led to full-blown AIDS for other reasons that needed additional\ninvestigation before the public was alerted. \"This is a non-story,\" Dr Paul\nVolberding, director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, said in an interview, noting that the pace of\nchange from HIV to AIDS depended not only on the virus but also the\npatient. \"There have been many cases of rapid progression. The New York\ncase is only that, a case report.\"\nBut public health officials said that with the battle against AIDS possibly\non the verge of a new phase, where drug-resistant strains become harder to\ntreat, Dr Frieden was right to go public. Dr Alfred Sommer, dean of the\nBloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, said\nhealth officials often did not have the luxury of waiting for full\nscientific information before acting. \"For most things we do, we do not\nhave ironclad proof one way or the other,\" he said.\nDr Frieden said that his initial announcement clearly contained cautions\nand unknowns, but that his actions were necessary given the potential\npublic health effects. \"We had enough clinical and scientific information\nto warrant making the announcement because of the immediate implications\nfor the community, and for doctors practicing in New York City,\" he said.\n\"We run the risk of either being a dollar short and a day late, or shouting\nfire in a crowded theater,\" said Dr Michael T Osterholm, director of for\nthe Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of\nMinnesota. \"The question is,\" he said of Dr Frieden, \"is he a prophet today\nor is he a prophet 10 years from now?\"\nThe debate is likely to grow louder beginning tomorrow in Boston when 3800\nof the world's top AIDS experts are to meet in a conference to discuss an\narray of new scientific findings. Long after the deadline for submissions\nof reports had passed, the doctors who handled the New York City case, Dr\nDavid D Ho and Dr Martin Markowitz, asked for a waiver to discuss the\nfindings about the possible strain they had made at the Aaron Diamond AIDS\nResearch Center in Manhattan. After much wrangling, the organizers of the\nmeeting agreed to hold an unusual special session for the disagreement\nabout the city's announcement.\nBut scientists were not the only ones upset about the city's actions. Some\ngay activists asserted that Dr Frieden was using the possible new strain as\na scare tactic to get gay men to practice safe sex, an accusation he\ndenied. Charles King, the president of Housing Works, an AIDS support\ngroup, said the announcement could be used to demonize the gay lifestyle\nand accused Dr Frieden of having wanted to change regulations regarding HIV\ntesting for a long time.\nThe Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project, based in New York, said the\nlink between the spread of the possible new strain and the use of crystal\nmethamphetamine was unproven, and suggested that the city had ignored the\n\"underlying issues\" behind the spread of the virus, like discrimination,\npoor housing and unemployment. \"Rather than increasing awareness of the\nrisks of unsafe sex and crystal use, the Health Department risks\nstigmatizing gay men as crazed drug addicts carelessly or wantonly\nspreading a killer bug,\" Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project said in a\nstatement. \"In this case, the Health Department seems to offer little to\nthe understanding of the root causes and potential solutions to drug use\napart from the discredited strategy of Nancy Reagan, 'Just say no.'\"\nMartin Delaney, the founding director of Project Inform, a nonprofit AIDS\nfoundation, said the city had been needlessly alarmist. \"By pushing this\nout early, the public health department set off panic nationwide, before\nthe scientific community had a chance to see the scientific data,\" Mr\nDelaney said.\nSeveral gay activists said Dr Frieden was motivated, in part, by a close\nrelationship with the Aaron Diamond Center, a charge that city officials\ndismissed as ridiculous. The center was created in 1988 to study the basic\nscience of AIDS as a joint venture of the city's Health Department, the New\nYork University School of Medicine, and the Aaron Diamond Foundation, a\nphilanthropic organization. Upon becoming commissioner in 2002, Dr. Frieden\njoined the center's board, as had all his predecessors since the founding\nof the institution. Health Department officials say he has no financial\ninterest in the center.\nDr Ho, then a relatively unknown 37 year old researcher fresh from Harvard\nand UCLA, was hired to run the center in 1989 and immediately attracted\nattention. With more money at his disposal than most other research\ninstitutions, Dr Ho became the object of envy as top-flight scientists\nlined up to join his center. Within a few years, Dr Ho's team won\ninternational publicity, challenging long-held theories about AIDS and\nreporting new evidence about the way the AIDS virus works in the body.\nHowever, Dr Ho has been criticized for trumpeting findings that other\nscientists say later proved wrong. For instance, Dr Ho and colleagues\nstrongly suggested, without explicitly stating it as fact, that a treatment\nwith drug cocktails could cure AIDS by eradicating the virus from a\npatient's blood. Since then, it has become clear that the virus lurks in\nhidden sanctuaries in the body, making it all but impossible to eradicate\nHIV with currently licensed drugs.\nCritics have also charged that ViroLogic, the lab that did some of the\ntesting for the Diamond Center and the Health Department in the most recent\ncase, is using the case to promote its services. The Monday after Dr.\nFrieden's Friday news conference, ViroLogic issued a news release calling\nattention to its work performing the test for drug resistance. Dr. Ho, who\nwas quoted in the release, serves on the scientific advisory board of\nViroLogic. His brother, Sidney Ho, does marketing work for the company and\nonce was the head of its communications department. William D Young, the\nchairman and chief executive of ViroLogic, said there was no effort by Dr\nHo to promote ViroLogic through this case. He said the company's scientific\nadvisers \"are very aware of their scientific reputations and that's\nparamount to them. At some times I prefer them to be promotional but they\nare not.\" Mr Young said ViroLogic issued the news release to make the\npublic aware of its role in the testing and its extensive nature. Dr Ho\nsaid that he has disclosed all of his ties to the company and that any\nsuggestion of impropriety was false.\nAfter Dr Frieden disclosed the case, reports of similar cases quickly\nemerged, some of which had been published earlier. For example, Dr Julio\nMontaner, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia in\nVancouver, reported in 2003 in the scientific journal AIDS that 2 men with\na highly drug-resistant strain of HIV might have progressed rapidly to\nAIDS. [See also comment below. - Mod.CP]. Dr Ho did not contact Dr Montaner\nabout the case until 3 days after Dr Frieden's news conference. Dr Ho said\nhe had searched standard databases for similar cases but did not find Dr\nMontaner's report. After being made aware of the cases and looking into\nthem, he said there were similarities but also significant differences.\n\"Our case was much more dramatic in the history of progression and\nresistance,\" Dr Ho said. Dr Ho, for his part, said, he was accustomed to\ncriticism, but insisted, \"We did the right thing in this case.\"\n[byline: Marc Santora and Lawrence K Altman: Andrew Pollack in Los Angeles\nand Carol Pogash in San Francisco contributed reporting for this article]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The question unresolved is whether the 2 phenomena -- triple drug\nresistance and accelerated progression to AIDS -- are related. It may be\nthat the patient has been infected by a rare HIV variant that transmits\npoorly and is present at such low frequency that it has not been detected\npreviously. Similarly, it is possible that the rapid progression to AIDS\nmay be a feature of the patient's genetic make-up rather than a property of\nthe virus. It was reported earlier (but not mentioned in the above report)\nthat the patient had not been treated with anti-retroviral drugs; if this\nis the case, selection of multiple drug-resistant variants in the index\npatient is unlikely.\nThe work of Dr Julio Montaner's group at the St Paul's Hospital and the\nUniversity of British Columbia has been referred to previously in\nProMED-mail (see: HIV, multi-drug resistant - Canada (British Columbia)\n20010810.1892). Research workers at St Paul's documented about a half-dozen\ncases in 2001 of newly infected people whose strain of the virus is\nresistant to all 3 classes of anti-HIV drugs. It is common for AIDS\npatients to develop a resistance to some of the drugs they are taking, and\n5 to 10 per cent of new infections in the US involve a form of HIV\nresistant to some types of drugs used in treatment of AIDS. But there had\nbeen only a handful of reported cases in the world in which a person was\nnewly infected with a type of HIV resistant to all 3 drug classes. In most\nof those cases, it was concluded at the time that in becoming triple\ndrug-resistant, the virus had mutated in a way that made it less effective\nand less dangerous. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City)(02) 20050216.0522\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476\n2004\n---\nHIV/AIDS, global epidemic escalates 20040706.1814\n2003\n---\nHIV-1: origin & history 20030614.1463\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n---\nHIV recombinants, global spread 20020520.4283\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\n2001\n---\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - Canada (British Columbia) 20010810.1892\n......................cp/pg/sh\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Many more tests need to be conducted to\ndetermine whether the strains from the 3 people are the same, said\nthe scientist, Dr. David Ho. He directs the Aaron Diamond AIDS\nResearch Center in Manhattan, which is conducting some of the studies\nin collaboration with the New York City health department. While some\nfindings may be available in a week, others will take longer, Dr. Ho\nsaid in an interview.\nEven if the strains prove to be the same, that would not necessarily\nmean that a \"supervirus\" is on the loose, since there could be\ngenetic factors in the 1st man that would make his infection progress\nfaster. \"What we can't prove is that this is a \"supervirus\" and that\nit caused the rapid progression from infection to AIDS in the New\nYork City man, Dr. Ho said. Laboratory tests in Dr. Ho's laboratory\nand elsewhere have shown that the strain from the man, whose case\nstarted the investigation, is resistant to 19 of the 20 licensed\nanti-retroviral drugs. AIDS experts said that the strain might have\nled to the rapid onset of AIDS in the man or that his immune defenses\nmight have been weakened by drug use or genetics [he was a crystal meth\nuser. - Mod.JW].\nMolecular tests of the man's HIV show that it has changes that appear to\ndiffer significantly from the typical strains [circulating] in New York City,\nand precisely what those changes mean remains to be determined, Dr. Ho said.\nHis laboratory has begun testing a virus that was isolated from a man who was\nknown to be HIV-infected before he became a sex partner of the New York City\nman. That partner probably had sex with the New York City man in October\n2004, a few weeks before the New York City man became ill with what his\ndoctors believe was [an] acute retroviral syndrome. It occurs in the earliest\nstages of HIV infection. The partner is \"a potential source for this man's\ncase,\" Dr. Ho said. \"But he may not be.\"\nThe 2nd virus is from an unidentified patient in San Diego who was\napparently infected before the New York City man. It was found by\nscouring the records of a commercial laboratory, ViroLogic Inc. of\nSouth San Francisco, and portions of its genetic makeup closely\nresemble the molecular pattern of the New York City man's virus, Dr.\nHo said. Dr. Ho's team sent the partner's virus to ViroLogic for\ntesting. Doctors from around the country also send thousands of HIV\nspecimens to the company for testing.\nAn additional man who was a sex partner of the New York City man has\ndeclined to participate in the epidemiologic investigation, Dr. Ho\nsaid. It is not known whether he is HIV-infected. The 2 male contacts\nin New York City, only one of whom is cooperating with the\ninvestigation, are among hundreds of men with whom the New York City\nman told health officials he has had sex in recent weeks while using\ncrystal methamphetamine. The New York man who sparked the\ninvestigation is cooperating with city health officials but\napparently does not know the names of all his partners. The health\ndepartment is trying to trace as many of his sex contacts as can be\nascertained. To protect his privacy, health officials have identified\nhim only as in his mid-40's.\nSo far, city health workers have reached \"about a dozen\" of the man's\ncontacts, said Sandra Mullin, director of communications for the\nhealth department. She said she did not know how many contacts have\nagreed to donate specimens for testing and, if so, what the findings\nare. Officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a\nfederal agency in Atlanta, said that they have notified health\ndepartments elsewhere. While the agency is aiding in the\ninvestigation, the city is taking the lead, said Dr. Ronald O.\nValdiserri, the director of HIV/AIDS prevention at the agency.\nOn Fri 11 Feb 2005, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the commissioner of the\nNew York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the man's\ncase was the 1st in which a strain of HIV had been found that showed\nboth resistance to multiple classes of drugs and apparently led to a\nrapid progression from infection to AIDS. Each component has been\nreported earlier. Dr. Frieden and other AIDS experts said they\nconsidered it prudent to investigate what they knew was only one case\nand to issue an alert to doctors and hospitals to seek other cases.\nDr. Frieden was joined by other AIDS experts at a news conference\nthat he said was intended to issue a wake-up call to the public and\nhealth professionals about the seriousness of unsafe sex and the\napparent increase in drug-resistant HIV strains. While the experts\nsaid that they could not rule out the possibility that they were\ndealing with an extraordinary confluence of 2 rare events, they also\nsaid they were concerned about the possibility of the man passing it\nto his hundreds of sexual contacts. The health department asked\ndoctors and hospitals for their help, because the city, like most\nother areas of the country, has no system to monitor the occurrence\nof HIV drug resistance among recently infected people. So, Dr.\nFrieden said, the city has no easy way to determine whether such a\nstrain was an isolated event or whether it was infecting a cluster of\npeople, small or large. Dr. Frieden and other experts said that,\nlogically, there had to be at least one other individual with the\nrare strain who gave it to the New York City man.\nSome scientists criticized the health department for causing\nunnecessary alarm by disclosing information about just one case, and\nfor calling a news conference when it had to say the scientific\npremise for its announcement was weak. Dr. Frieden defended his\ndepartment's decision to issue a warning on Friday [11 Feb 2005].\n\"Everyone who hears this, their 1st thought is either it can't be\ntrue, or, if it is, it can't be that significant,\" Dr. Frieden said\nin an interview. \"But the more you hear about it, the more concerned\nyou become.\" He said that the decision to go public was not easy and\nwas not taken lightly, but that, given the evidence he had available,\nhe had no doubt they did the right thing.\nAs he cautioned on Friday [11 Feb 2005], several things remain\nunknown. They do not know how widespread this strain is or how\nwidespread it will become. They also do not know how this patient\nwill fare. But they do know several troubling things beyond a doubt,\nhe said. \"There is not a question that drug resistance is on the\nincrease,\" he said. In addition, he said, there is no good system in\nplace to track patient adherence to drug treatment. That, paired with\nthe fact that there is far too much risky sex taking place in which\nmethamphetamine use plays a role, is enough to give anyone pause.\n\"One of our really core values is that we take a great deal of care and pride\nin what we say,\" Dr. Frieden said. \"We don't go out and say things unless we\nhave reasonable certainty that what we say is correct.\" He said that anyone\nwho suggests that the department issued the warning simply to scare the\npublic into behaving more responsibly was absolutely wrong. Dr. Ho\nacknowledged that it was extraordinary for the health department to issue an\nalert before the full scientific information was available or made public.\nBut Dr. Ho said he and other scientists were doing the very tests that\ncritics said had not been performed. \"A lot of people are asking for data\nthat we either have not disclosed or we are working on,\" Dr. Ho said. \"It\ncould be that the man is genetically prone to have a rapid progression,\" Dr.\nHo said.\n[Byline: Lawrence K. Altman, with assistance from Marc Santora]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The HIV strain recovered from this patient has been designated 3-DCR HIV and\nappears to be unique, although a virus with some similar genetic features is\nbeing studied in a San Francisco laboratory. The uniqueness of this case is\nthe combination of multiple drug resistance (resistance to 3 of the 4\ncommonest classes of anti-retroviral drugs) and an unusually rapid\nprogression to AIDS (20 months, in contrast to an average of 10 years). It\nhas still to be established, however, that the 2 phenomena are related. It\nmay be that the patient has been infected by a rare HIV variant that\ntransmits poorly and is present at such low frequency that it has not been\ndetected previously. Similarly, it is possible that the rapid progression to\nAIDS may be a feature of the patient's genetic make-up rather than a property\nof the virus. It was reported earlier (but not mentioned in the above report)\nthat the patient had not been treated with anti-retroviral drugs, therefore\nselection of multiple drug-resistant variants in the index patient is\nunlikely. Another unknown factor is the frequent use of the drug crystal\nmethamphetamine, a stimulant taken by the patient to reduce sexual\ninhibitions. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476\n2004\n----\nHIV/AIDS, global epidemic escalates 20040706.1814\n2003\n----\nHIV-1: origin & history 20030614.1463\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n----\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\nHIV recombinants, global spread 20020520.4283\n2001\n----\nHIV, multi-drug resistant - Canada (British Columbia) 20010810.1892\n...........................cp/msp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

He was first diagnosed with HIV in\nDecember 2004 and appears to have been recently infected. The\ndiagnosis of 3-DCR HIV was made shortly thereafter at the Aaron\nDiamond AIDS Research Center. Since then, the patient has developed\nAIDS. DOHMH is counseling and offering HIV testing to those contacts\nof the patient who have been identified.\nWhile drug resistance is increasingly common among patients who have\nbeen treated for HIV, cases of 3-DCR HIV in newly-diagnosed,\npreviously untreated patients are extremely rare, and the combination\nof this pattern of drug resistance and rapid progression to AIDS may\nnot have been diagnosed previously. Strains of 3-DCR HIV are\nresistant to 3 of the 4 available types of antiviral drugs that are\nmost commonly prescribed: nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and\nprotease inhibitors. This strain also caused a rapid onset of AIDS,\nwhich usually occurs more than 10 years after initial infection with\nHIV. In this patient's case, onset of AIDS appears to have occurred\nwithin 2 to 3 months, and at most 20 months, after HIV infection.\nHealth Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden, MD, MPH said, \"This case is a\nwake-up call.1st, it's a wake up call to men who have sex with men,\nparticularly those who may use crystal methamphetamine. Not only are\nwe seeing syphilis and a rare sexually transmitted disease --\nlymphogranuloma venereum -- among these men, now we've identified\nthis strain of HIV that is difficult or impossible to treat and which\nappears to progress rapidly to AIDS. This community successfully\nreduced its risk of HIV in the 1980s, and it must do so again to stop\nthe devastation of HIV/AIDS and the spread of drug-resistant strains.\n2nd, doctors in New York City must increase HIV prevention\ncounseling, increase HIV testing, obtain drug susceptibility testing\nfor patients testing HIV-positive who have not yet been treated,\nimprove adherence to anti-retroviral treatment, and improve\nnotification of partners of HIV-infected patients. 3rd, the public\nhealth community has to improve our monitoring of both HIV treatment\nand of HIV drug resistance, and we have to implement prevention\nstrategies that work.\"\nThe Health Department recently issued a Health Alert to physicians,\nhospitals and other medical providers asking them to test all\npreviously untreated patients newly diagnosed cases for anti-HIV drug\nsusceptibility. The Department is monitoring laboratories for\nadditional cases of 3-DCR HIV in newly diagnosed persons. DOHMH is\nalso working with New York State to establish a long-term system for\nmonitoring drug resistance in HIV-positive patients who have not yet\nundergone treatment. Dr. Frieden added, \"Patients who are on\ntreatment for HIV/AIDS and are doing well do not need susceptibility\ntesting unless advised to by their physician.\"\nDr. David Ho, CEO and Director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research\nCenter, said \"This patient's infection with an HIV-1 strain that is\nnot amenable to standard anti-retroviral therapy, along with his\nrapid clinical and immunological deterioration, is alarming. While\nthis remains a single case, it is prudent to closely watch for any\nadditional possible cases while continuing to emphasize the\nimportance of reducing HIV risk behavior.\"\n\"The rapidly growing crystal meth epidemic in New York city continues\nto play a significant role in facilitating the transmission of HIV.\nIn light of the emergence of this virulent new strain, health care\nproviders must be especially vigilant in not only recognizing and\ndiagnosing HIV infection, but also in recognizing the signs and\nsymptoms of crystal methamphetamine use in their patients,\" said Dr.\nAntonio Urbina, Medical Director of HIV education and training, at\nSt. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center.\n\"Callen-Lorde is deeply concerned about this newly identified case of\nmultiple drug resistant HIV,\" said Jay Laudato, Executive Director of\nthe Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. \"We urge all persons, both\nHIV-negative and -positive, to only engage in safer sex practices in\norder to prevent new infections or re-infection. For those persons\nwho don't know their status, we urge HIV testing and obtaining the\ninformation and support necessary to reduce their risk for HIV\ninfection. We also ask all gay and bisexual men to become\nknowledgeable about the dangers of crystal methamphetamine and in\nparticular its relationship to sexual risk taking.\"\nDr. James Braun, President of the Physicians Research Network, said\n\"We believe that the transmission of treatment-resistant HIV was a\ndisaster waiting to happen, particularly in communities where safer\nsex is not practiced regularly and in light of people using drugs\nlike crystal meth. All primary care providers in acute care settings\nneed to know how to diagnose HIV in its earliest stages and where to\nrefer people so that new infections are properly worked up and\ntreated.\"\n\"HIV prevention is an ongoing process,\" said Ana Oliveira, Executive\nDirector of Gay Men's Health Crisis. \"We have to double our efforts\nand resources to maintain treatment and prevention education for\npeople who are infected as well as for those who are not. New Yorkers\nmust be vigilant and know that infection with resistant strains of\nHIV can be avoided. People living with HIV can live healthy and\nsatisfying lives by protecting themselves and their partners,\nregardless of HIV status.\"\nTokes M. Osubu, Executive Director of Gay Men of African Descent,\nsaid, \"This is the news we have all been fearing. While the recent\nadvances in HIV treatment have led to the improvement of countless\nlives, we have always known that many people respond poorly to these\ntherapies and for many others, the side effects are devastating.\nContinued education about staying safe and avoiding HIV remains our\nmost potent weapon.\"\nDr. Jay Dobkin, Director of the AIDS Program at Columbia University\nMedical Center, said, \"This case is a striking reminder that the risk\nof getting infected with HIV has not gone away. In fact, risky\nbehavior may be even more dangerous now since there is a chance of\ninfection with a virus we may not be able to treat.\"\n\"This case should drive home the point that substance use can lead to\nunsafe sex, and unsafe sex can lead to infection with a highly\ndrug-resistant strain of HIV that can be extraordinarily difficult to\ntreat and may cause rapid progression to AIDS,\" said Roy M. Gulick,\nMD, Associate Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College\nin Manhattan.\nDr. Jack DeHovitz, Professor at SUNY-Downstate Medical Center said,\n\"This finding supports the need for enhanced availability of HIV\ntesting, as well as preventive interventions, which are effective in\nreducing subsequent HIV transmission.\"\nThere is an epidemic of HIV and AIDS in New York City: more than 88\n000 New Yorkers are known to be living with HIV/AIDS, and an\nestimated 20 000 more are believed to be living with HIV/AIDS and\ndon't know it. Free and fully confidential STD exams and treatment,\nas well as confidential or anonymous HIV testing, are available at\nHealth Department clinics throughout New York City.

Either this patient has had the\nmisfortune to be infected with a spontaneous HIV mutant resistant to\nall 3 classes of anti-retroviral drugs, or the extensive use of\nanti-retroviral drugs in the community may have selected this\nunwelcome triple drug-resistant variant, and an outbreak of HIV\ninfection and AIDS not amenable to treatment with currently available\ndrugs is in the offing.

Some 400 000 people in the developing world have\naccess to the drugs out of 6 million who need them, UN experts here said.\nAccording to the report, the most global epidemic in history is also\nbecoming increasingly feminine. Now, nearly half of all people infected\nbetween the ages of 15 and 49 are women. In Africa, the proportion is\nalmost 60 per cent.\nThe report comes at a time when the world has significantly boosted its\ncommitment and resources to HIV/AIDS, but the need is still far greater,\naccording to the fourth global report by the Joint United Nations Program\non HIV/AIDS released in advance of Sunday's 15th International AIDS\nConference here. \"Over 20 years of AIDS provides us with compelling\nevidence that unless we act now we will be paying later -- a trenchant\nmessage for the countries of Asia and the Pacific,\" said Peter Piot, the\nprogram's executive director, in the report.\nIn Asia, with 60 per cent of the world's population, 7.4 million people are\nliving with HIV. One of every 4 newly-infected people is Asian. The\nepidemic is fueled by drug use, sex work, and sex between men, but it is\nfast moving into the general population, UN experts said. China and India\nhave severe epidemics in a number of provinces, territories, and states. In\nIndonesia and Vietnam, infections among injecting drug users have soared.\n\"There's a . . . window of opportunity to get prevention programs up to\nscale in Asia,\" said Kathleen Cravero, the program's deputy executive\ndirector at a press conference here. \"If we miss it, we will see an\nepidemic the likes of which we never imagined despite what has happened in\nAfrica.\"\nFar from leveling off, in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa infection\nrates are on the rise. In that region alone last year, 3 million people\nbecame sick with HIV. Seven countries in southern Africa report prevalence\nrates -- the percentage of people who have HIV -- of more than 15 per cent.\nThey are Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, and\nZambia.

A highly sensitive screening test likely failed to\ndetect tainted blood used in transfusions to a man who has since tested\npositive for HIV, the Health Ministry said. If officials confirm the man\ncontracted HIV from tainted blood, it will be the first such case since the\nintroduction in 1999 of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) to screen\ndonated blood.\nThe man, whose name and age were withheld, underwent the transfusions as an\ninpatient at a hospital in the Kanto region between March and July [2003]\nto treat anemia caused by kidney trouble, Ministry officials said. Blood\ndonated by 8 people was used in the transfusions. He received red blood\ncells under the treatment. The man was found to be HIV-positive in\nSeptember, after transferring to another hospital, the officials said. The\nman's doctors said the possibility he caught HIV, the virus that causes\nAIDS, through sexual intercourse is very low.\nThe Ministry reported the case on Wed 1 Oct 2003 to a panel on blood supply\nservices that oversees emergencies. The Ministry is investigating the cause\nof infection and trying to ascertain whether any of the 8 blood donors are\nHIV-positive, officials said. Stored blood samples from the 8 donors have\nbeen re-tested using a screening system even more sensitive than the\nordinary NAT, according to the Japanese Red Cross Society, which oversees\nthe nation's blood donation programs.\nNone of the samples tested positive for HIV, Red Cross officials said. But\nit is possible the virus went undetected because the viral load was too low\nat the time of donation, maybe because the donor had only recently\ncontracted HIV, officials said. Blood plasma from 3 of the 8 donors has\nalready been used on 3 other patients, one of whom later died of an\nunrelated illness. The other 2 patients are being tested for infection.\nBlood plasma from the remaining 5 donors has not yet been used.\n--\nVladimir Trofimov\nHead of Treatment Section\nOblast AIDS Centre\nPskov, Russia\n<caids@ellink.ru>\n[It still seems far from conclusive that the patient did in fact contract\nHIV via transfusion of contaminated blood.

That is\nwhy certain countries have introduced PCR [testing] for hepatitis C virus,\nand possibly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Even with PCR, protection\ncannot be 100 percent [certain] [1]. Pathogen inactivation of cellular blood\nproducts is under development. Products used for pathogen inactivation\ninterfere with nucleic acids of the pathogen and might also interfere with\nnucleic acids in the blood recipient, thus possibly becoming mutagenic and\ncarcinogenic. As residual infectivity of cellular blood products in developed\ncountries is very low, the net benefit of pathogen-inactivated blood products\nis difficult to prove.\nIt is highly unlikely that 6400 blood donors in Japan donated whole blood\nduring the early phase of infection. It is more likely that the plasma of\nsome infectious donations entered a plasma pool from which 6400 plasma\nderivatives (e.g., albumin, coagulation factors, and immunoglobulins) were\nproduced [or that plasma from 6400 donors was pooled to produce those\nderivatives. - Mod.JW]. Production processes of plasma derivatives normally\ncontain highly efficacious virus inactivation procedures. I am not aware of\nbreak-through infections of hepatitis C virus or HIV through virus-\ninactivated plasma derivatives during the last 8 years, and I would be very\ninterested to learn further details.\n[1] Schuttler GC, Caspari G, Jursch CA, Willems WR, Gerlich WH, Schaefer S\n(2000) Hepatitis C virus transmission by a blood donation negative in\nnucleic acid amplification tests for viral RNA.

The prevailing theory of how the\nfirst human got AIDS is that about 75 years ago, someone in central Africa\ncut himself while butchering a chimpanzee for food. The animal was infected\nwith simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which after a few adaptive\nmutations evolved into human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in its new host.\nThis is known in AIDS research circles as the \"cut-hunter hypothesis.\"\nA team of European and American scientists offered in today's issue of\nScience [Bailes et al., Hybrid Origin of SIV in Chimpanzees, Science 2003\n300: 1713] what might be called the \"cut-chimpanzee hypothesis\" of how that\nspecies acquired SIV, the genetic \"father\" of HIV. Sometime deep in\nprehistory, they say, a chimpanzee killed and consumed two monkeys -- a\nred-capped mangabey and a greater spot-nosed monkey -- each infected with\nits own particular strain of SIV. Both viruses got into the chimp's\nbloodstream, probably through an open wound. This scenario is based on the\nresearchers' discovery that the virus chimpanzees now carry is a combination\nof the mangabey and spot-nosed monkey strains of SIV. For the two strains to\nmix and fuse, a chimp would have to be simultaneously infected by both --\nand that is likely to happen only through the bloody activity of predation.\nThe research and its conclusions \"emphasize the parallels with the origin of\nHIV infection in humans,\" said Paul Sharp, an evolutionary geneticist at the\nUniversity of Nottingham in England. About 30 different African primates\nharbor SIV, often with no ill effects, and each species' strain is\ndifferent. Genetic analysis shows that chimpanzee SIV -- the closest\nrelative to the human virus -- had some genes that are similar to the\nred-capped mangabey's SIV and others that are like the greater spot-nosed\nmonkey's SIV. Sharp and his collaborators in France and the United States\nattempted to nail down the relationship between the strains. They looked at\n4 genes from 8 different species of primate and constructed dozens of\nhypothetical family trees for the virus strains. The ones that made the most\nsense had the chimpanzee SIV as the product of the fusion of virus strains\nfrom red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys.\nThis made geographical sense. One of the 3 subspecies of chimpanzees\nthat carry SIV occupies the same region of west central Africa near Cameroon\nand Gabon as the two other animals. And although they were once thought to\nbe gentle vegetarians, it is now known that chimps hunt the monkeys for\nfood. The hybrid scenario requires that at some point an individual chimp\nwas infected with SIV from both species and that the viruses underwent a\n\"recombination event,\" which mixed their genes inside a cell. The new\nresearch adds to the AIDS virus' biography by filling in the story of its\nancestors. Sharp says there is also a lesson of more immediate importance.\nIt is remotely possible that chimpanzee populations -- which are rare,\nscattered and hard to study -- harbor other SIVs capable of infecting human\nbeings. He and other researchers are looking for them. And they still might\nacquire other similar viruses in the future. \"It could happen tomorrow,\"\nSharp said. Human beings appear to have obtained the AIDS virus from African\nprimates twice. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) -- which accounts\nfor virtually all the cases of AIDS around the world -- came from\nchimpanzees. HIV-2, a slightly different strain that is the cause of a very\nsmall number of AIDS cases in west Africa, came from sooty mangabeys.\n--\nProMED-mail\nSee Also\nHIV-2: origin and history 20030514.1201\n2002\n----\nHIV/AIDS, origin and evolution 20020119.3310\nHIV recombinants, global spread 20020520.4283\n1998\n----\nHIV, new strain - Cameroon 19980901.1755\nHIV/AIDS origin 19980212.0278\nHIV/AIDS origin (02) 19980216.0304\n.......................cp/jw\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Dr Martine Peeters, of the Laboratoire Retrovirus in\nMontpellier, France, and colleagues characterized the genome sequences of\nisolates from an individual in Senegal and one in Mali. As they report in\nthe Journal of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes for 15 Apr 2002 [J\nAcquir Immune Defic Syndr 2002; 29: 522-30], the 2 isolates matched 2\nothers described in patients from Burkina Faso and Mali. All 4 isolates\ncomprised a mosaic genome structure that included fragments from HIV\nsubtypes A, G, K, and J. They matched isolates previously described in\npatients from Burkina Faso, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria. On the basis of\nnewly proposed nomenclature, the strains are designated CRF06-cpx. The\nstrains have also been isolated from patients in France and Australia,\nindicating global spread. Dr Peeters' group notes the importance of seeking\nbiological differences among subtypes and circulating recombinant forms and\ntracking their molecular epidemiology; \"because recombination may introduce\ngenetic and biological consequences that are far greater than those\nresulting from the steady accumulation of single mutations.\" It remains to\nbe seen how viral recombination will affect viral properties, such as host\nviral loads and drug resistance, the researchers suggest.\nIn another report in the same issue of the journal [J Acquir Immune Defic\nSyndr 2002; 29: 536-43], Dr Rafael Njera of the Instituto de Salud Carlos\nIII in Madrid, Spain, and colleagues detail the characterization of the\nfirst reported recombinant to originate in western Europe. Its genome is\nmade up primarily of subtype G, with the extracellular portion subtype B's\nenv. They propose the designation CRF14_BG. The researchers also note that\na parental non-recombinant subtype strain has been isolated in the same\narea, implying that the recombinant virus was most likely generated locally\nin northwestern Spain or in Portugal. They postulate that sources of the\nG-subtype viruses are fishermen infected by contact with prostitutes in\nsub-Saharan Africa or immigrants from former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past ProMED-mail has not posted information on HIV or AIDS, and\nwill continue to exclude reports relating to the prevalence, treatment, and\nprevention of AIDS. We do, however, post a few reports on the epidemiology\nof HIV that impinge on the spread and evolution of HIV and HIV-associated\ndisease. Currently HIV-1 is classified into 3 major groups: M, N, and O.\nGroup M, which encompass the global spread of HIV-1 and comprise several\nsubtypes or clades designated A to H that have appeared in different\ngeographic settings.

It is common for\nAIDS patients to develop a resistance to some of the drugs they are taking,\nand 5 to 10 percent of new infections in the United States involve a form\nof HIV resistant to some types of drugs used in treatment of AIDS (acquired\nimmune deficiency syndrome). But there have been only a handful of reported\ncases in the world where a person was newly infected with a type of HIV\n(human immunodeficiency virus) resistant to all 3 drug classes. In most of\nthose cases, it appeared that in becoming drug-resistant, the virus that\ncauses AIDS had mutated in a way that made it less effective and less\ndangerous.\nIn an interview on Wed 8 Aug 2001, Montaner said researchers at St. Paul's\nhave recently treated 2 patients with multi-drug resistant HIV whose virus\nspread faster than normal. In both cases, Montaner said, the patients (who\nare still alive) contracted the virus from their partners. Montaner stated\nthat it is possible similar viruses are already spreading in Vancouver --\nraising fears of a new epidemic of [multi-drug resistant] AIDS.\nDrug cocktail therapies usually involve taking 2 of the 3 classes of AIDS\ndrugs at once. So someone who becomes resistant to one class of drug still\nhas \"a backup,\" Montaner said. But someone who is resistant to 2 or 3 drug\nclasses has far fewer options. The spread of drug-resistant HIV has led\nsome researchers, including those at St. Paul's, to develop so-called\n\"salvage therapies\" that involve bombarding patients with dozens [this\nseems unlikely - Man. Ed. DS] of different types of drugs to try to\nsuppress the HIV in their system and then move them to more stable\ntherapies. Montaner argues that urgent measures need to be taken now to\navoid something similar happening with AIDS, which could begin to erase the\ngains against the disease made over the past 7 years. \"If we are not able\nto come up with a strategy that avoids [drug-resistant HIV perpetuating]\nitself . . . we may be creating a scenario that you can currently see with\nmulti-drug resistant tuberculosis,\" Montaner said.\nIn an editorial in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine\n[entitled \"Antiretroviral therapy for previously treated patients,\" NEJM\n345(6):452-2], Montaner, along with Dr. John Mellors of the University of\nPittsburgh, argues that regulators and pharmaceutical companies need to be\nmore flexible in allowing experimental drugs to be used on patients with\ndrug-resistant HIV. At present, new drugs are usually tested on patients\nonly along with existing, approved drugs. This is done to measure the\neffectiveness of a single new medicine properly and to ensure patients\naren't put at risk by being put on several unproven drugs at once. People\nwith drug-resistant HIV often do become healthier when treated with new\ndrugs, Montaner said. \"But the benefit is transient\" -- with the virus\nusually returning in time. To have any hope of tackling drug-resistant HIV\nin the long-term, Montaner said, drug-resistant patients need to be treated\nwith several new experimental drugs at once to suppress the virus. Such a\nchange in approach requires the cooperation of drug companies and\ngovernment regulators, Montaner said, to strike a balance between rigorous\nscientific testing and getting new drugs to desperate patients. \"There has\nto be a recognition that the single most important challenge we're facing\ntoday is people that have a drug-resistant virus,\" Montaner said. \"What\nwe're trying to do is ring a bit of an alarm\".\n[Byline: Chad Skelton]\n--\nAkira GOTO\n<m1774@geocities.co.jp>\n[ProMED-mail does not routinely cover HIV and AIDS, but the emergence of\nmulti-drug resistant HIV in newly diagnosed patients presents a new\nchallenge.

One important consequence of this is that HIV-infected women have\nbeen found to respond poorly to the standard regimen of antenatal\nsufadoxine/pyrimethamine admininitration (2 doses) and may only respond if\nit is administered monthly. The effect of HIV-1 on malaria parasitemia is\nmore pronounced in multigravidae than in primigravidae (3,4). In studies in\nMangochi and in Chikwawa (both in Malawi) the prevalence of placental\nparasitemia in primigravidae at delivery was slightly decreased by HIV. In\nboth studies, in contrast, the prevalence of placental parasitemia was\ntwice as high in HIV-infected multigravidae as in HIV-negative multigravidae.\nMalaria may also have an effect on HIV infections in nonpregnant adults.\nRecently, a Malawian study has demonstrated that malaria-infected adults\nhave 7-fold higher HIV viral loads than malaria-free adults (1). Whether a\nsimilar change in viral loads occurs in pregnant women (which could affect\nmother-to-child transmission) remains to be seen.\n1. Hoffman, I. F., Jere, C. S., Taylor, T.

For many years The fact that _L.tropica_ was producing cutaneous\nleishmaniasis in man but in other species would cause muco-cutaneous disease\n(e.g. psamomys) was interpreted as due to different types of cellular\nimmune reactions of different species. _L.donovani_ is not producing the\nsame reaction in man and this is the explanation for its hematological\nspread, thus producing the visceral form of the disease. Now this\nassociation raises, in my mind, the possibility that we may not be dealing\nwith _L.donovani_ but maybe with _L.tropica_ that infects a host with a\nmodified cellular reaction as the result of the effect of the HIV infection.\nTherefore it would be very\ninteresting to know if in those cases of visceral leishmaniasis that are\nreported in association with HIV infection, the serological type of the\nleishmania was definitely established.

The main modes of transmission for adults\nliving with HIV/AIDS were sexual transmission among men who have sex\nwith men and through injecting drug use.\nLeishmania/HIV co-infection in south-western Europe Leishmania/HIV\nco-infection has emerged in southwestern Europe as a result of the\nincreasing overlap between visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and AIDS, which\nis due to the spread of the AIDS pandemic in rural areas and that of VL\nin suburban areas. This has important clinical, diagnostic,\nchemotherapeutic and epidemiological implications. Although cases of\nco-infection have so far been reported in 28 countries worldwide, most\nof the cases have been notified in south-western Europe (France, Italy,\nPortugal and Spain). The cases reported in these countries between\nJanuary 1996 and June 1998 represent 49.8% of the total number of cases\n(1 440) they have reported since 1990.\nWhile Leishmania/HIV co-infection is increasing in eastern Africa and\nthe Indian subcontinent, owing to the simultaneous spread and\ngeographical overlap of both diseases as well as periodic epidemics of\nVL, cases of co-infection are expected to diminish in south-western\nEurope due to the new combinations of anti-HIV drugs. The number\nreported to WHO continues to rise however, due to increased awareness\nand better case definition...\nPopulation at risk\n------------------------\nThere is a clear predominance (71.1%) among intravenous drug users\n(IVDU), who are clearly identified as the main population at risk.\nRegarding the proportion of IVDU compared to other risk groups, there is\nno significant difference from one country to the other. Globally, the\nproportion of homosexuals is almost the same (11.1%) as that of\nheterosexuals (11.4%), but at country level there are significant\ndifferences...\nImmunological status/opportunistic diseases\n------------------------------------------------\nAIDS increases the risk of VL by 100-1 000 times in endemic areas.\nMoreover, a person with HIV infection whose immune system is suppressed,\nand who is bitten by a sandfly infected with _Leishmania_, will develop\nsevere leishmaniasis. VL, once developed in the HIV-infected person,\naccelerates HIV replication and impairs the patient\u0092s condition by\nfurther immunosuppression. As a consequence, most of the patients\n(91.5%) have less than 200 CD4/mm3. The subject quickly becomes an AIDS\npatient with opportunistic diseases such as tuberculosis, candidiasis,\npneumonia due to _Pneumocystis carinii_ or toxoplasmosis.\nConclusion\n---------------\nIn the future the risk of co-infected patients, as carriers of\n_Leishmania_ in the blood, should be carefully taken into consideration as\na source of infection for the sandfly during the blood meal and also, in\nthe case of intravenous drug users, as a new way of transmission owing\nto the sharing of needles with contaminated blood.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Note that ProMED-mail excludes items on HIV/AIDS.

Pollack <pollackmp@mindspring.com>\n& Lizz K <ekopecny@mail.usyd.edu.au>\nSource: NY Times 25 Aug 1999 [edited]\n\nPrivacy Issues Raised in Syphilis Cases Linked to San Francisco Chat Room\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn what health officials believe is the first time a disease cluster has\nbeen traced to cyberspace, the department of public health here has tracked\nan outbreak of syphilis cases to an America Online chat room.\nOfficials from the San Francisco Department of Public Health said 6 men who\nhad contracted syphilis in the last 3 months have traced their last sexual\nencounters to partners they met through a chat room created by an America\nOnline member, San Francisco Men 4 Men (SFM4M).\nThe case is a new development for public health officials who traditionally\ndefine an affected group by the members' physical proximity or relation and\nposes a question for the electronic age: when does the right to online\nprivacy yield to public health issues?\nSome of the men who were infected with syphilis know their multiple partners\nonly by their computer nicknames, or \"handles.\" While such anonymity could\nbe an obstacle to public health officials in other cases, say among people\nwho met in a bar, in this case, America Online knows the participants' real\nnames but would not divulge them.\nSo the only way to contact the scores of sex partners the syphilis-infected\nmen met online has been through e-mail and postings in the chat room itself.\nAlthough the number of men known to be infected so far is small and their\ninfections were identified early and are fully treatable, they represent a\nsizable number of the 17 syphilis cases reported in San Francisco this year,\nand the cluster has provided a frightening glimpse of a potentially larger\npublic health risk, as more and more people use computers to find sex\npartners, officials said.\nBesides the 6 men who met partners through the America Online chat room,\nwhich is open only to its subscribers, a seventh local man who contracted\nsyphilis since June said he met his sex partners through an Internet relay\nchat room, known as an I.R.C. Together, the seven men have identified 99 sex\npartners in the last 3 months -- one man had 47 partners -- and 5 of the 7\nmen have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, health\nofficials said.\nAt a time when both syphilis and AIDS cases are at an all-time low in San\nFrancisco, as in the rest of the country, officials are now worried that\nthese 7 syphilis cases may indicate a new venue has been created for unsafe\nsex. The core group of individuals using cyberspace to meet multiple,\nanonymous sex partners is the same as that which would use bathhouses or\nhighway rest stops or other pick-up venues to engage in\nunsafe, potentially dangerous sex, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, the director\nof the sexually transmitted disease unit at the public health department.\nNot only did 5 of the infected men expose numerous partners to HIV, but\nbecause syphilis causes open sores that increase the vulnerability to HIV,\ntheir partners are at greater risk of contracting the virus, Dr. Klausner\nsaid.\nOnce the health department traced the cluster of syphilis cases to the chat\nroom, Dr. Klausner said he called America Online to find out how the\ndepartment could contact all the exposed sex partners, as well as those men\nwho might have contact with the exposed men.\nAmerica Online does not give out the names of subscribers as a matter of\npolicy, unless presented with a court order or in the event of special cases\nlike a physical threat, said Rich Damato, a spokesman. Asked whether the\nsyphilis cluster constituted a physical threat, he said, \"I would not want\nin this case to speculate what would constitute a physical threat.\"\nDr. Klausner said that the health department considered trying to subpoena\nthe names of the chat room subscribers, but \"there wasn't a large enough\npublic health risk to warrant that.\"\nInstead, in a move applauded by Internet privacy advocates, America Online\nput the health department in touch with Planet Out, a worldwide online\nservice in San Francisco for homosexuals.\nTom Rielly, chairman of Planet Out said that the service used e-mails,\nvolunteers and its own Web site ( www.planetout.com) to get the word out in\nthe last 2 weeks to the chat room users who would be more likely to read\nmail from the service than from other sources.\n\"What we did first was send a letter out to the chat room names the health\ndepartment obtained from the men who were infected,\" Rielly said. Then, he\nsaid, Planet Out posted instant messages to people who were in the chat\nrooms. It also trained 60 volunteers to visit the chat rooms and talk to\npeople there, and posted information on its Web site.\nOf the 99 men who were directly exposed to syphilis, 33 have been tested.\nDr. Klausner estimated that perhaps another third had contacted their own\ndoctors, while the remaining still do not know that they were exposed.\nDeirdre Mulligan, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology,\na policy organization in Washington that advocates protecting privacy rights\nin the cyber age, commended the health department and Planet Out for how\nthey handled the situation. By contacting people online, the agency has a\nchance to reach not just infected participants, but also those who may be at\nrisk, she said. \"They're saying, 'Look, be careful,' \" Ms. Mulligan said.\n\"They're potentially reaching a much broader audience.\"\nTim Westmoreland, a senior policy fellow and public health expert at\nGeorgetown University Law School, also applauded the effort. \"I've never\nheard of a case like this -- ever,\" he said. One sticking point, he said, is\nthat the health department cannot be certain that infected participants will\nreturn to the chat rooms. But on the whole, he said, warning people in chat\nrooms is an easier way of contacting people and more efficient than\ntraditional door-to-door methods. \"This is a new way of defining the\ncommunity,\" he said. \"It's not defined by physical geography, but by the use\nof cyberspace.\"\n(A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta\nsaid that she had never heard of another cluster traced to cyberspace, but\ncould not be certain that one exists but was not reported.)\nDr. Klausner of the health department said that since Planet Out began its\noutreach, the numbers of men seeking testing at the department's sex clinics\nhas nearly doubled.

A2; Weiss, Rick\nFrench researchers have discovered a rare, new HIV strain that can avoid\ndetection with standard screening tests. The strain was found in a\n40-year-old Cameroonian woman who died of AIDS complications in 1995. The\nstrain has only been found in three other cases, all in Cameroon.\nAccording to lead researchers Francois Simon and Francoise Brun-Vezinet of\nthe Bichat Hospital, the strain is related to both common HIV and SIV\nstrains. Following analysis of the woman's blood in Paris, researchers\nobserved that the virus belonged to neither group M -- the predominant\ngroup -- or group O.\nThey also noticed that the new strain had hallmarks of SIV. The scientists,\nwho report their findings in the September issue of Nature Medicine, then\ntested 700 other frozen blood samples from people in Cameroon, finding that\nthree other HIV samples matched the woman's.\nThe HIV variant does not appear to have any selective advantage that would\ncause it to spread at a different rate than the predominant strains.\nAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases, called the new strain an \"interesting curiosity\" and\nsaid it was unlikely that the new strain would pose a public health threat.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[We do not normally report HIV/AIDS, but we did report the appearance of\ngroup O, and we are reporting this one now in case Dr. Fauci turns out to\nbe wrong. - Mod.JW]\n.......................................jw/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

David D. Ho and Tuofu Zhu\nof the Aaron Diamond Research Center in New York and Andre J. Nahmias of\nEmory University reported the results at the Fifth Conference on\nRetroviruses and Opportunistic Infections as well as in this week's issue\nof the journal Nature. Molecular analysis of the sample, taken in a study\non malaria resistance by Arno Motulsky at the University of Washington,\nshows that the infected man probably contracted the disease approximately a\ndecade after the virus moved from non-human primates to human hosts. Ho and\nZhu note that comparisons between the newly discovered sample and current\nhuman immunodeficiency viruses show a \"common ancestor\" virus from the late\n1940s or early 1950s, placing the origin of the virus at an earlier date\nthan many scientists had believed. Nahmias began testing for HIV in 1,213\nof Motulsky's samples shortly after antibody tests became available in\n1985. After he narrowed down the samples to one--which tested positive for\nHIV through every available test at the time--Ho and Zhu assessed a portion\nof the sample using polymerase chain reaction to amplify DNA from the serum\nsample and test conclusively for the presence of HIV. Zhu and Ho, along\nwith collaborators at Los Alamos National Laboratory, used mutation rates\nto date the \"common ancestor\" virus. Although Ho said \"this [finding] is\nclearly not going to impact on how we take care of our patients today,\" he\nnoted the data may give researchers a better idea of HIV and other\n\"emerging infections\" function over time.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[We do not normally post items on HIV/AIDS, but in view of the importance\nof the issue, we thought you would be interested.
