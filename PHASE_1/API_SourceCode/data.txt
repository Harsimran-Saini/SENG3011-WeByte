Between September and December 2020, 6 people fell ill with infections from _E. coli_ O146:H28. Those sick live in 5 federal states. Two people needed hospital treatment. As yet, there is no indication as to the source of the outbreak, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). It is understood other countries in Europe have not reported related infections.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) has instructed AGES to investigate the outbreak with the relevant state authorities. Austrian food testing in 2018 found _E. coli_ O146 in 3 samples of fresh game meat and one sample of fermented sausage. In 2017, 4 isolates were typed as _E. coli_ O146 from 2 samples of raw meat from wild ruminants, fresh bovine meat and a fermented sausage.\n\nThe latest Zoonoses Report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows _E. coli_ O146 was the 5th most frequent serogroup reported in confirmed human infections in 2018.\n\nAnyone who has developed symptoms of EHEC infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Most patients recover within 5 to 7 days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAbout 5% to 10% of those diagnosed with EHEC infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.\n\nMany people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than 5 years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Shiga toxin-producing O146 is one of the non-O157 serotypes causing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ disease. The source of this zoonotic infection in Austria is not clear at this point. Potential vehicles for transmission include salads, unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked ground beef. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nAustria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/109]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nE. coli EHEC - Germany: (MV) O26, day care centers, RFI 20201204.7992377\nE. coli EHEC - Norway: hemolytic uremic syndrome, fatal 20200730.7625577\n2019\n----\nE. coli EHEC - Norway: hemolytic uremic syndrome, unusual strain, RFI 20190909.6665443\nE. coli EHEC - Denmark: hemolytic uremic syndrome, fatal 20190905.6659381\nE. coli EHEC - Iceland (03): O26, ice cream susp 20190717.6571885\nE. coli EHEC - Iceland (02) 20190715.6569675\nE. coli EHEC - Iceland: 20190705.6553835\nE. coli EHEC - France: O26, unpasteurized cheese 20190429.6448172\n2018\n----\nE. coli EHEC - France (03): O26, unpasteurized cheese, more cases 20181221.6219141\nE. coli EHEC - Europe: O80:H2, hybrid invasive pathogen, antimicrobial resistance 20181109.6134613\nE. coli EHEC - Sweden: RFI 20180816.5968531\nE. coli EHEC - Norway: O157, RFI 20180719.5915567\nE. coli EHEC - Ireland (02): increased numbers 20180704.5888313\nE. coli EHEC - France (02): O26, unpasteurized cheese, more cases 20180604.5837791\nE. coli EHEC - Ireland: (Ulster) childcare center 20180527.5820927\nE. coli EHEC - France: O26, unpasteurized cheese, alert, recall 20180511.5792857\nE. coli EHEC - Canada: cheese, 2013, 60 day rule 20180220.5639238\nE. coli EHEC - Denmark: O26 20181106.6129035\nE. coli EHEC - UK (02): (England) O157, raw pet food, fatal, 2017 20181019.6100174\nE. coli EHEC - UK: (England) fatal 20181005.6071314\nE. coli EHEC - Ireland (03): (GY) daycare 20180722.5915568\n.................................................ll/rd/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-03-14 00:00:00", "2017-03-14 00:00:00", "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "2020-03-14 00:00:00", "2019-03-14 00:00:00", "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2013-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Austria", "country": "Austria"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "England", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7444580", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Unknown nematode - Viet Nam: (YB) RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7444580", "date": "2020-06-10 15:02:50", "main_text": "UNKNOWN NEMATODE - VIET NAM: (YEN BAI) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n**************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 7 Jun 2020 09:43 ICT\nSource: Saigon Giai Phong (SGGP) [edited]\nhttps://sggpnews.org.vn/health/young-man-in-northern-region-infested-with-dracunculus-medinensis-87070.html\n\n\nThe National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi announced the admission in hospital of a young man in the Northern Province of Yen Bai who was infested with a rare worm.\n\nThe 23-year-old man was hospitalized when he was suffering abscesses on his legs and then the abscesses spread to his arms. Additionally, he had fatigue and pain for many days.\n\nSurgeons later have removed 5 rare intestinal worms with a length of 30-60 centimeters [12-24 in] from the abscesses in his hands.\n\nHead of the hospital's Surgery Ward Dr Tran Thuong Viet said the worm had never been discovered in Viet Nam before but is commonly found in rural areas of Africa with scientific name _Dracunculus medinensis_ -- a species of roundworm that causes Guinea worm disease.\n\nThere is no specific medication [for the disease caused by this worm], doctors have used the usual dose to remove the worms.\n\nThrough investigation, doctors found that the man usually eats living fish and crabs. As the worm is rare in the country, physicians said that it is necessary to study water sources where the man lives because the worm eggs are spread via a water source.\n\n[Byline: Nguyen Quoc; translation: Uyen Phuong]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is highly unlikely that this case is due to the Guinea worm _Dracunculus medinensis_. Guinea worm has never be described outside Africa. Transmission is by drinking water contaminated with small copepods or eating raw fish. Recently dogs have been identified as hosts as well (https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/dracunculiasis/index.html).\n\nIf this is indeed _D. medinensis_, it will be the 1st time the parasite has been reported outside of Africa. With an incubation time of up to 18 months this means contamination in the environment and probably more human cases.\n\nIt is strongly advised that the material removed from the patients is sent for molecular analysis. - Mod.EP\n\nA number of tissue nematodes and larva migrans syndromes, some associated with consuming aquatic animals, can be found in Southeast Asia. Histopathology and DNA analysis of the recovered worms will be key to determining whether this case is a unusual manifestation of a previously reported parasitic nematode, or in fact a novel parasitic infection. - Mod.LXL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map of Viet Nam: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/66860]\n\n.................................................sb/ep/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": [], "locations": [{"location": "Hanoi", "country": "Vietnam"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "Vietnam"}, {"location": "Saigon", "country": "Vietnam"}, {"location": "the Northern Province", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "Guinea", "country": "Guinea"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6744567", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Community-acq. pneumonia - USA: (WV) school-aged children, unknown etiology, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6744567", "date": "2019-10-24 18:00:21", "main_text": "COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA - USA: (WEST VIRGINIA) SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN, UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*******************************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 22 Oct 2019\nSource: The Intelligencer [edited]\nhttps://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2019/10/pneumonia-outbreak-reported-in-marshall-county-schools/\n\n\nApproximately 50 cases of pneumonia are being reported among children in Marshall County Schools, according to officials today [22 Oct 2019]. \"Cameron Elementary School and Hilltop Elementary School have a high percentage of reported cases,\" said Shelby Haines, superintendent of schools. The outbreak, though, isn't limited to those 2 schools.\n\n\"There are around 50 reported cases,\" said Thomas Cook, Marshall County Health Department administrator. The majority of cases are occurring \"in a couple of schools,\" he said, but added, this illness \"is not just confined to Marshall County.\n\nThere are other cases of this throughout the state,\" said Tony Wood, spokesman for Marshall County Schools.\n\nIt has yet to be determined whether the cases of pneumonia are caused by a virus or bacteria, Cook said. State epidemiologists are sending testing kits to the health department for distribution to rapid care facilities, Cook said. Swabs taken from patients will be sent to the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health for testing and diagnosis of the form of infection affecting local residents.\n\nTreating the symptoms is recommended for either form of pneumonia. Antibiotics, however, are prescribed only for bacterial pneumonia. Doctors \"are not going to give antibiotics unless you have a bacteria that you want to eradicate,\" Cook explained.\n\nExtensive cleaning is being done in school buildings to prevent additional cases. \"Last week [week of 14 Oct 2019], we began getting phone calls of reported cases of illness in a number of schools,\" Haines said. \"When those reports came, we began cleaning with an approved disinfectant to try to get a jump on it. We increased the custodial staff to clean with approved methods. \"The superintendent said the school district has bought its own ionizer, a machine that is being used for cleaning during after-school hours. \"In the evening, we run a cleaning device that sprays disinfectant on all surfaces, on top of regular cleaning. It sprays a mist and sticks to surfaces,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, school personnel and health educators are training children on the importance of hand washing, using facial tissues. and coughing into one's elbow. \"Hand washing is the key to everything,\" Cook said.\n\nThe health department has sent a sanitarian to Cameron and Hilltop schools to check the facilities. \"The county (school system) has really been pro-active in cleaning and education,\" the health administrator said.\n\nWhen the outbreak began, \"we started to receive calls from the parents, from the urgent care (centers) with people coming in with some difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever. Chest X-rays were showing congestion in lungs and classical signs of pneumonia,\" Cook said.\n\nThe health official predicted that pneumonia also will affect the adult population and younger children. Patients can go back to school or work when their fever subsides for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication, he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[We are told that about 50 cases of pneumonia are being reported among children, mainly in 2 elementary schools in the Wheeling, West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area, Marshall County, West Virginia, although additional cases are also being reported throughout the state. Patients are said to be school children with difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever, and chest X-rays findings consistent with pneumonia. No further details about this outbreak are given in the news report above. The microbial etiology is as yet unknown.\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and, less commonly, fungi. Viruses, such as influenza, can cause of outbreaks of CAP. Other viruses that cause CAP in school-aged children include adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus capable (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/5/681.full.pdf). Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus are more common in children under 5 years of age (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/15750086). Common bacterial causes of CAP in this age group include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia pneumoniae_. Outbreaks of CAP caused by _M. pneumoniae_ occur mostly in crowded environments, like households, schools, college dormitories, and military barracks, when coughing releases small droplets of respiratory secretions into the air that are inhaled by close contacts.\n\nFungi rarely cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy people, but outbreaks of CAP caused by environmental fungi that are characteristic of certain regions of the US, such as _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_, and _Blastomyces_, can occasionally occur, when soil harboring these fungi are disturbed. Although unlikely in elementary school children, the opioid epidemic in the US could also cause CAP as a result of aspiration of anaerobic bacterial mouth flora or as a result of injection drug use giving rise to hematogenous _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia.\n\nThe Wheeling Metropolitan Statistical Area, with a population of a 147 950 residents in 2010, consists of 2 counties in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia and one in eastern Ohio, anchored by the city of Wheeling, which is about 90 miles (about 145 km) southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia_metropolitan_area).

You're thinking of folks with maybe less than optimal eating habits, less than optimal sleep habits. Folks that maybe aren't practicing the best hand hygiene,\" Burick said. Those who smoke or have asthma also have an increased risk of contracting the flu or pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection that can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, and in severe cases can cause breathing difficulties.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 184 individuals ages 15 to 24 in the United States who died from influenza and pneumonia in 2015, which is a small fraction of the more than 57 000 people who died from influenza and pneumonia among all ages that year.\n\nAnd MedExpress locations in the area have already seen more pneumonia cases this year [2017] than in all of 2016. Symptoms can sometimes vary with pneumonia, and it can evolve from the flu due to a compromised immune system.\n\n\"When you're thinking of the classic symptoms, it's a cough that is persistent, and you're thinking of a fever. Typically a higher fever within that 100-point mark; most folks tend to have that fatigue, that malaise, just not feeling well sensation,\" Burick said. \"At the same point, it's not always isolation of symptoms. Some people are also coming in with those flu-like symptoms.\"\n\nThe most common form of pneumonia is bacterial, meaning it can be treated with antibiotics. But other forms can be viral or fungal, meaning the illness needs to run its course. The most important thing people should be aware of is prevention techniques, Burick said. \"Practicing great hand hygiene, being cautious not to share food or drinks,\" she said. \"It might sound silly, but making sure you're getting adequate sleep and paying attention to your diet.\"\n\n[Byline: Kate Malongowski]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that there has been 74 percent more cases of young adults with pneumonia between 2015 and 2016 than previously in a 9-county region that includes Beaver County in the US state of Pennsylvania, but fails to indicate what these counties are or to give the microbial causes for this increase.\n\nCenter Township, a suburban community approximately 25 mi (40 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, is located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Township,_Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania). Beaver County is on the border with the states of West Virginia and Ohio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania#Adjacent_counties) and is part of the Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Adjacent counties are Lawrence (north), Butler (east), Allegheny (southeast), Washington (south), Hancock, West Virginia (west) and Columbiana, Ohio (west).\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and, less commonly, fungi. Common bacterial causes of CAP in the United States are _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (also called pneumococcus), _Legionella pneumophila_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia pnueumoniae_. Outbreaks of CAP caused by M. pneumoniae occur mostly in crowded environments, like households, schools, college dormitories, and military barracks, when coughing releases small droplets of respiratory secretions into the air that are inhaled by close contacts. The opioid epidemic in the U.S. could also be causing an increase in cases of CAP as a result of aspiration of anaerobic bacterial mouth flora or as a result of injection drug use giving rise to hematogenous _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia.\n\nViruses, such as influenza, also can cause of outbreaks of CAP. Travel-associated pneumonia may be caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula or H5N1 or H7N9 strains of avian influenza indigenous to Asia. Fungi rarely cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy people, but outbreaks of CAP caused by environmental fungi that are characteristic of certain regions of the U.S., such as _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_ and _Blastomyces_, can occasionally occur, when soil harboring these fungi are disturbed.\n\nFurther information on the clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/240.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nPneumonia - Myanmar: (RA) fatal, children, elderly, RFI 20160114.3934329\nPneumonia - Pakistan: (PB) children, comment 20160103.3907955\n2015\n----\nPneumonia - Pakistan: (PB) children, RFI 20151214.3861544\nPneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea (06): (SO) WHO, update 20151120.3805799\nPneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea (05): (SO) vet students, comment 20151107. 3773797\nPneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea (04): (SO) vet students, comment 20151105.3769946\nPneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea (03): (SO) vet students 20151103.3762772\nPneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea (02): (SO) vet students 20151101.3758677\nPneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea: (SO) vet students, RFI 20151030.3756621\nPneumonia - New Zealand: increased incidence 2006-2015, RFI 20150616.3442295\nUndiagnosed illness - Russia: (NO) fatal, pneumonia, school-aged children, RFI 20150220.3180017\n2014\n----\nPneumonia - Pakistan: (Punjab) children, RFI 20141221.3046969\n2013\n----\nUndiagnosed viral pneumonia - China: (AH) medical staff, RFI 20130614.1773873\nFungal pneumonia - UK: (Scotland) bagpipe, alert 20130311.1581224\n2012\n----\nPneumonia - Nepal: (UD) children, RFI 20121205.1439452\n2011\n----\nPneumonia, children - India: (Chenai) 20110503.1375\nAtypical pneumonia - Mexico: (CH) RFI 20110324.0932\n2010\n----\nPneumonia, ovine - USA (13): (MT) bighorn sheep 20101111.4087\nNovel pneumonia-associated adenovirus, Titi monkey, human 20101023.3850\nUndiagnosed pneumonia - Ukraine: (KH) 20100712.2335\n.................................................sb/ml/ao/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "mers-cov"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2015-03-14 00:00:00", "2016-03-14 00:00:00", "2016-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2015-11-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Chlamydia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "South Korea"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Beaver County", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Mycoplasma", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Virginia", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pittsburgh", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Center Township", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Township,_Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ukraine", "country": "Ukraine"}, {"location": "Pneumonia", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hancock", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5312885", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Unknown gas poisoning - Germany: (Frankfurt) airport", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5312885", "date": "2017-09-13 07:33:55", "main_text": "UNKNOWN GAS POISONING - GERMANY: (FRANKFURT) AIRPORT\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Mon 11 Sep 2017 11:58 PM AEST\nSource: The Sun/News Corp Australia Network [edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/yblf3z92\n\n\nSix people have been injured after gas was released at Frankfurt Airport in Germany.\n\nEmergency services responded to the incident, which occurred inside terminal one at 11 am on Monday morning [11 Sep 2017] local time (7 pm AEST).\n\nThe Sun reported someone tear gassed passengers waiting at the check in counter, with breathing difficulties reported among the victims.

Preliminary results indicate a mixture of 2 synthetic opioids, with one of the drugs being consistent with a new fentanyl analogue.

There are some reports in the news of this drug being imported from East Asia (I believe it may have 1st surface in Ohio?). Carfentanil is 10 000 times more potent than morphine (100 times more potent than fentanyl). The DEA also released the following statement regarding a rise in carfentanil overdoses/exposures dating back to Sep 2016: https://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2016/hq092216.shtml\n\nIf this ultimately is what ends up being identified in the drug analysis, my best suggestion is to contact the local zoo veterinarian, as these drugs have long been used in zoos by veterinarians and intensive and detailed protocols have been written at all institutions using the drug to help guide those who may need to respond to a potential human exposure. The biggest risk in these exposures is re-narcotization, which might explain why the large doses of naloxone were needed.\nI look forward to hearing the results of the testing; please feel free to email with any questions.\n\n--\nKatherine Fogelberg\nUniversity of Tennessee health sciences center\n<Katherine.Fogelberg@unthsc.edu>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: Thu 8 Jun 2017\nFrom: Ken Waldrup, DVM\n[email address withheld by request]\n\nIn the northern states, they have been having problems with heroin laced with a carfentanil derivative. The legal carfentanil drug is approximately 700 times more potent than heroin so naloxone has a difficult time reversing such a potent opioid. In dealing with large ungulates immobilized with carfentanil, veterinarians learned that naloxone couldn't cut it 30 years ago. Naltrexone is the reversal agent of choice with veterinary use of carfentanil.\n\n--\nKen Waldrup DVM\n[email withheld on request]\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: Jun 9, 2017 2:33 PM\nFrom: \"Powell, Ryan\" <RPowell@rdn.bc.ca>\n\n\nRe: Drug Abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI\n\nThe article \"Drug Abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI\" resonated with me because of the fentanyl crisis occurring in British Columbia, Canada. The reaction to the drugs after use, and the necessity of naloxone for counteraction sounds very similar to the effects of fentanyl and it will be interesting to hear if that is what the substance is identified as.\n\nhttp://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/fentanyl-continues-to-drive-b-c-overdose-spike\n\n--\nRyan Powell\nLaboratory Technician\nGreater Nanaimo Pollution Control Centre\nRegional District of Nanaimo\n<rpowell@rdn.bc.ca>\n\n[A total of 2 individuals have mentioned carfentanil. Indeed, this drug does seem to more closely resemble the situation reported in the original release.\n\nOn the other hand, the lab believes it has found what is a fentanyl analogue. Carfentanil has a relationship to fentanyl and could be described as a fentanyl analogue, or perhaps the lab has not considered veterinary drugs, especially since carfentanil is not appropriate for human dosages. However, I would be skeptical that the lab is not aware of carfentanil.\n\nThe lab has mentioned the product is a fentanyl analogue so it seems unlikely that it would just be fentanyl as described in the article/video from Canada. Although, perhaps lab wanted to double check and used this as a way to buy some time. I would be surprised if that was the case, but knowing the need for laboratory correctness and the political sensitivity of this, it could be possible. - Mod.TG\n\n\n\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/213.]\nSee Also\nDrug abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI 20170608.5091370\n2016\n----\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA (02): (CA) 20160824.4437183\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA: (New York City) alert 20160718.4353090\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - UK 20160112.3929799\n2015\n----\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA (04): (NY) 20150507.3346435\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA (03): (LA) 20150501.3334873\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA (02): (AL) 20150427.3324558\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA: (NY) 20150419.3308552\n2014\n----\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - Russia: (KV, KM) 20140930.2819762\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA: (CO) 20140127.2233681\n2013\n----\nDrug abuse, synthetic drugs - USA: (CO) contamination 20130830.1914246\n.................................................tg/ec/mpp/ec/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2016-09-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ohio", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "GA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LA", "country": "Bolivia"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "British Columbia", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "KM", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Russia", "country": "Russia"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5091370", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Drug abuse - USA: (GA) pot. lethal unknown substance, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5091370", "date": "2017-06-08 11:08:57", "main_text": "DRUG ABUSE - USA: (GEORGIA) POTENTIALLY LETHAL UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*****************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 6 Jun 2017\nSource: Georgia Department of Public Health [edited]\nhttps://dph.georgia.gov/press-releases/2017-06-06/hospitalizations-and-deaths-possibly-tied-street-drugs-being-sold-georgia\n\n\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) has become aware of a dangerous, potentially lethal substance contained in street drugs surfacing in central and South Georgia.

Mod.AS, edited]\nhttp://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/Vet/Yechidot/mispo/pirsumim/2017/hodaa_pe_tlafaim.htm\n\n\nOn [Mon 6 Feb 2017], FMD was suspected in a dairy cattle operation in the Western Negev Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, located approximately 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] from the Gaza strip border]. FMD has been confirmed by the laboratory; the causative agent has not yet been serotyped.\n\nWe are also informed about clinical signs of FMD in a sheep flock within the Gaza strip. Plausibly, the Nir Yitzhak outbreak originated in the Gaza strip. Since the possibility that an exotic virus strain may be involved has been raised, extreme precaution is prescribed to avoid unnecessary contacts with animals. A 10 km [approx. 6.2 mi] outbreak zone around the affected farm has been implemented [the note includes a table specifying 24 settlements within the 10 km zone. - Mod.AS].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The described FMD event is exceptional in Israel for the following 2 aspects:\n\n1. Contrary to the disease in small ruminants and beef cattle, FMD has been for decades very rare in Israel's dairy cattle. This is mainly due to their robust immunity maintained throughout the years by a compulsory, methodically, State-applied periodical vaccination regime with polyvalent inactivated vaccines that include regionally circulating virus strains.\n\n2. All reported FMD outbreaks, since the establishment of the State of Israel, are considered to have been introduced from the north (Lebanon, Syria) and (less often) east (Jordan). The current outbreak seems to be the 1st one originating in the south-west. FMD was reported from the Gaza strip in 2012 (serotype SAT2) and 2013 (serotype A); in both cases suspected to have been introduced from Egypt. In both events, the virus did not enter Israel's territory.\n\nFor the location of Nir Yitzhak, which is situated in Israel's \"Hadarom\" (The South) district, see map at http://tinyurl.com/jd8mmq9.\n\nThe (inactivated, oil emulsion) FMD vaccines applied in Israel for the compulsory vaccination of cattle were composed, in 2015, of the following vaccine strains:\n\n1. Serotype O: O Manisa, O-3039, O-4625, O Israel 2007 (4 strains)\n2. Serotype A: A- 4165, A Iran 05 (2 strains)\n3. Serotype Asia 1: Asia1 Shamir (1 vaccine strain).\n\nIt would be interesting to note if the same composition was applied in 2016.\n\nInformation on the serotype and genotype of the causative virus strain involved, the number and age distribution of the affected cattle and the vaccination history of the Nir-Yitzhak dairy operation, is awaited. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29822.]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (03): (HZ) bovine, st O, spread 20151130.3829799\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (02): (HZ) porcine, OIE, st O 20151123.3812972\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel: (HZ) porcine, st. pending, RFI 20151122.3810601\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth: (WE) ovine, st O susp, RFI 20151116.3795215\n2014\n----\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (04): (HZ, HM) ovine, st O, genotyping 20140226.2301774\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (03): (HM) ovine, st O, OIE, RFI 20140208.2264193\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth: (WE) ovine, caprine, st O, RFI 20140124.2227362\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (02): (HM) ovine, caprine, RFI 20140116.2177975\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel: (HZ) ovine, caprine, st O 20140114.2170228\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel, PA: st O, genotyping 20140109.2161860\n2013\n----\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel, PA: st.

Between [19 and 29 Oct 2015], 3 people who work in the same facility developed symptoms of pneumonia. From [22 to 24 Oct 2015], they were admitted to hospital. On [27 Oct 2015], the hospital isolated the patients and alerted local health authorities, which then informed the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).\n\nAdditional information on the outbreak\n-------------------------------------------\nTo date, 84 cases with respiratory symptoms have been identified; 55 of them were diagnosed with pneumonia and 29 cases were mildly symptomatic. The 55 patients with pneumonia were isolated in 7 different hospitals while the 29 patients with mild symptoms were under home quarantine.\n\nAs of [11 Nov 2015], only 1 of the 55 patients with pneumonia was still hospitalized; the other 54 cases had all been discharged. Currently, none of the patients is in critical condition.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nIn response to the outbreak, KCDC and the government of the Republic of Korea have implemented a series of public health measures: issued daily press releases to the public; conducted contact tracing -- 1664 contacts have been monitored on a daily basis; established a hotline for reporting potentially-linked cases; requested hospitals to report pneumonia cases with potential links to the cluster; closed and disinfected the affected facility.\n\nSo far, all PCR tests carried out by the KCDC have been negative, including for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus (including MERS-CoV), as well as for _Mycoplasma_, _Chlamydia_, _Corynebacterium_, __Bordetella_, Brucella_, _Coxiella_, and _Legionella_.\n\nAt present, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

All cases have been hospitalized in isolation, but all apparently have mild illness. 96 per cent had fever (temperature above 37.5 C) (99 F), but we are not told the height of the fever. Only 32 per cent had a cough, and only 14 per cent had a cough productive of sputum. We are not told if any had difficulty breathing. Though we are told 8 per cent had \"chest aches\", we are not told if the chest pain was pleuritic in nature.\n\nThe 1st reports of the outbreak at Konkuk University said only graduate students in the veterinary school were affected, but now the affected individuals are only characterized as \"workers\" in the university's Animal Life Sciences Building; however, we are not told the nature of their work. The outbreak has involved workers on the 3rd-7th floors, but the attack rates were usually highest among workers on the 5th and 7th floors.\n\nThere are an additional 26 cases who were in the Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever, but apparently failed to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia. There has been no evidence of secondary spread among contacts of the patients.\n\nThe 1st case became symptomatic on 19 Oct 2015, and the outbreak intensified between 25 and 27 Oct 2015 (29 cases, 58 per cent of total cases). The Animal Life Sciences building was closed on 28 Oct 2015 and there have been no new cases in the past 2 days. So far, no etiologic agent has been identified.

Health authorities have placed all 21 in quarantine and closed off the school building. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015] said the victims started coming down with pneumonia last week, and a team of epidemiologists have been dispatched to the university.\n\nAccording to the KCDC, those infected are master's and doctoral candidates who used the school's lab from [19 to 28 Oct 2015]. They are being treated in isolation at state-run hospitals.\n\nThe 1st 4 graduate students who showed symptoms were hospitalized at Konkuk University Medical Center and then transferred to the National Medical Center on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015]. All of them visited a cattle fair in Gyeonggi Province last week as well as an animal farm owned by the university in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province.\n\nA university official said they may have contracted brucellosis, which infects cattle and can be transmitted to humans. But some experts suspect Q fever, caused by the _Coxiella burnetii_ bacteria found in the droppings of cattle, swine and sheep. It causes airborne infections among humans. Symptoms such as fever, headache and muscle aches appear after a 2-week gestation period. But Song Dae-sup at Korea University said, \"Brucellosis and Q fever are not commonly found in Korea and are rarely passed on to humans. We need to look at the possibility of pneumonia caused by germs or other toxic agents.\"\n\nLee Jae-gap at Hallym University Medical Center said since only the 4 visited the animal farm, the infection could be mycoplasma pneumonia or whooping cough, which sometimes occur in schools or communities.\n\nKonkuk University sealed off the veterinary school building and told the school's 850 staff and students to report any suspicious symptoms. The building was thoroughly disinfected on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015] morning as well, according to school officials.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This news report was also submitted by Dan Silver, ProMED-mail Rapporteur.]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 30 Oct 2015\nSource: The Chosun Ilbo [edited]\nhttp://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2015/10/30/2015103001031.html\n\n\n10 more graduate students have come down with a mysterious pneumonia attack at Konkuk University's Seoul campus on Thursday [29 Oct 2015], bringing the total to 31.\n\n21 people were diagnosed with the same symptoms earlier. But all have so far tested negative for a dozen well-known infectious diseases.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure out the cause,\" a spokesman for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] said Thursday.\n\nStudents look at instructions in front of a makeshift clinic at Konkuk University in Seoul on Thursday [29 Oct 2015]. The school said all patients are graduate students at the school of veterinary science and most have mild symptoms.\n\n23 are in isolation at state-run hospitals, while 8 with very mild symptoms are quarantined at home. All have tested negative for brucellosis, Q fever, and _Legionella_, which were among the prime suspects of the mysterious infection. They also tested negative for bacterial diseases like _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ and viruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] and flu.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that the SK Group conducted recruitment exams on the campus last Sunday [25 Oct 2015], when the outbreak was probably already underway. Authorities asked 500 people who took the exams to report to the KCDC if they have symptoms like high fever.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This news report was also submitted by Dan Silver, ProMED-mail Rapporteur.]\n\n[The fact that a large group of veterinary graduate students became ill with pneumonia over a short period of time suggests a point source outbreak, i.e., they were all exposed to the same source over a brief time. The development of additional cases over time and geographic areas will be very useful in determining whether the cases are related to a point source.\n\nWe are not told exactly the severity of the illness, but almost 75 percent of cases were ill enough to require hospitalization. The fact that the illness seems at the present time to be limited to graduate veterinary students suggests a zoonosis. Brucellosis, Q fever, MERS, and influenza, as well as legionellosis, chlamydiosis, and _Mycoplasma_ infection were said to have been ruled out, but the report does not mention SARS. I don't know how legionellosis was ruled out, but Pontiac fever, a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis, occurs as a point source outbreak with high attack rates following exposure to aerosolized _Legionella_. Pontiac fever is diagnosed serologically; culture and legionella urinary antigen are usually negative. However, the severity of the Pontiac fever is so mild that it usually does require hospitalization. Other etiologies to be considered should include psittacosis (again I am unsure how a chlamydial infection was ruled out), tularemia, pneumonic plague, and anthrax. Histoplasmosis, although very rare in South Korea, can also cause a point source outbreak of an acute respiratory illness. More information is obviously needed from knowledgeable sources to develop a list of potential etiologies.\n\nKonkuk University is a private university located in Seoul and Chungju.

The H5N8 strain was discovered early in 2014 in Korea and China, and reached Japan soon afterwards. \"From there the strain probably spread with migratory wild birds to India, Europe, Canada and later the United States of America,\" the OIE said in its statement.\n\nThe Paris-based organisation [OIE] urged its 180 member countries to better apply biosecurity measures in farms, live bird markets and in trade, and step up surveillance to curb the spread of the disease. The OIE data shows 28 countries were hit by outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5 and H7 [antigenic] types of bird flu since the start of 2015, up from 19 countries affected in 2014 and 14 countries in 2013.\n\nA global epizootic -- an epidemic outbreak in animals -- of H5N1 bird flu, which emerged in early 2004, led to several cases in humans, of which more than half proved fatal. It also led to the death of tens of million poultry, OIE said. Although a pandemic was averted, the H5N1 strain is still present. Several outbreaks have been confirmed in West African countries in recent months, and the epidemic continues in Egypt, in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\n[byline: reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; editing by Raissa Kasolowsky]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A subscriber who wishes to remain anonymous also points out, \"Other articles on this topic report that serological evidence of human infections with various H5N2 viruses have been detected in Taiwan (2012), South Africa (2011), and Japan (2005-2006).

Services [edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/other/confirmed-case-in-texas.htm\n\n\nThe CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) have completed the investigation of the recently reported 4th vCJD case in the United States. It confirmed that the case was in a US citizen born outside the Americas and indicated that the patient's exposure to the BSE/vCJD agent most likely occurred before he moved to the United States; the patient had resided in Kuwait, Russia and Lebanon.\n\nThe completed investigation did not support the patient's having had extended travel to European countries, including the United Kingdom, or travel to Saudi Arabia. The specific overseas country where this patient's infection [could have] occurred is less clear, largely because the investigation did not definitely link him to a country where other known vCJD cases likely had been infected.\n\nVariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), 1st described in 1996 in the United Kingdom, is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder in humans. It is believed to be caused by consumption of products from cows with the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease). Worldwide, more than 220 variant CJD patients have been reported, with a majority of them in the United Kingdom (177 cases) and France (27 cases).\n\nThis case is the 4th to be reported in the United States. In each of the 3 previous cases, infection likely occurred outside the United States, including the United Kingdom (2 cases) and Saudi Arabia (1 case). The history of this 4th patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States. CDC assisted the Texas Department of State Health Services' (DSHS) investigation of this case and has continued to establish the patient's history, including the potential source of infection.\n\nThe classic form of CJD, which is not caused by the BSE agent, occurs worldwide, including in the United States. Annually, for every one million people in the United States, 1-2 develop classic CJD.\n\nMore information about variant CJD, including how it differs from classic CJD, is available in the Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Fact Sheet (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/factsheet_nvcjd.htm).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nTerry S.

No further information relevant to the location of victim's site of exposure has become available, and there is still no evidence suggesting that exposure occurred in Texas or elsewhere in the USA. - Mod.CP]\n\n[But with such a rare condition, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence -- as has been shown by the sudden emergence of ebolavirus-Zaire in West Africa.

Genetic analysis has shown that all these individuals have all been infected with the same strain. Most of these cases are adults but the total number of cases has an age range of between 2 to 90. 27 males and 48 (64 percent) females have been affected. In addition, there have also been 10 secondary cases reported. These are people who have become unwell through contact with a primary case.\n\nFurther details are available on 82 of the total cases all of whom reported symptoms of diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea was reported by 58 people (71 percent) and 25 people have been hospitalized as a result of their illness. There have been no deaths or cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome which is a serious complication of an _E. coli_ infection which can result in kidney failure.\n\nPHE is working with Public Health Wales, Health Protection Scotland, Animal and Plant Health Agency and the Food Standards Agency to gather, share and analyse information. At present there is no clear indication as to what is causing the outbreak.\n\nDr Bob Adak, head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at PHE, said: \"Any infection with _E. coli_ can be very serious. We have carried out initial investigations which involved interviewing some of the affected people to look for connections that link individuals in terms of the foods that they had eaten and the places they had visited in the days before they became ill.

The Departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Moselle seem particularly concerned. \"The GDS [National Federation of Animal Health Protection Groups] and veterinary practitioners have developed a framework for investigations in cooperation with Prof Schelcher, Veterinary School, Toulouse.\n\nThe phenomenon has been observed since the beginning of the lambing season. On 14 Dec 2012, GDS Meurthe-et-Moselle identified agalactia in 15 out of a total of about 200 farms. Affected farms were visited, the attack rate of the lambing ewes was recorded as 50 to 100 percent. The reported cases appear scattered in the departments concerned, demonstrating absence of colostrum/milk during the 1st post-parturition days. This leads to the need to hand-feed the lambs. Lactation appears again (with or without therapeutic treatment) in the ewes 2-8 days post parturition.\n\nNo particular clinical symptoms have been seen in the ewes prior to the observed compromised lactation.\n\nThe established platform of investigation applies to veterinarians and farmers in other geographical regions to report similar observations to a given e-mail address (see source url).\n\n[Byline: Michel Jeanney]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is not a case of the infectious mycoplasma disease in sheep and goats called \"contagious agalactiae\", which, on top of its effect upon lactation, also causes ocular and joints (arthritic) changes.\n\nUpdated results of the surveillance and of the epidemiological investigation are anticipated with interest. It will be interesting to note if the puzzling lactation issue, appearing immediately after parturition and involving a high percentage of the lambing ewes in a non-negligible number of sheep flocks (breeds not specified) in Lorraine, is found to be related to any (subclinical?) infective agent or is rather of non-infectious nature (e.g., metabolic/nutritional). - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1oxc.]\n\n.................................................sb/arn/ejp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-01-23 00:00:00", "2012-12-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "France", "country": "France"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1304335", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rabies - China (03): ex India, human, exposure unknown", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1304335", "date": "2012-09-21 17:15:57", "main_text": "RABIES - CHINA (03): ex INDIA, HUMAN, EXPOSURE UNKNOWN\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 21 Sep 2012\nSource: Ynetnews.com Israel News [edited]\nhttp://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4284406,00.htm\n\n\nIsraeli dies of rabies in China\n-------------------------------\nA 34-year-old Israeli died at a hospital this week, apparently of rabies, Yedioth Ahronoth [The Times of Israel] reported on Friday [21 Sep 2012]. According to this report, the Israeli, who recently arrived in China after travelling [in] India, contacted an Israeli businessman a few days ago and told him he was feeling ill, was suffering from severe back pain, had difficulty drinking and was vomiting constantly.\n\nThe businessman rushed the Israeli to a local hospital where he underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure. While at the hospital the Israeli suffered from hallucinations during which he claimed the Chinese doctors were trying to harvest his organs.\n\nThe physicians initially thought the man was suffering from some sort of mental illness and tried to determine whether he used drugs. Some doctors suggested transferring the Israeli to a psychiatric hospital after he recuperated, but his condition quickly deteriorated. He slipped in and out of consciousness, and the doctors hooked him up to a ventilator.\n\nThe mystery was solved when an infectious disease specialist was rushed to the Israeli's room and determined that he had contracted rabies. It remains unclear whether the Israeli, who died on Wed 19 Sep 2012, [had been] bitten by a dog and if so when [and where].\n\nMore than 55 000 people dies of rabies each year, [many] in India.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[People contract rabies predominantly following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal. Dogs are the main host and transmitter of rabies in Asia. The initial symptoms of rabies are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. As the virus spreads through the central nervous system, progressive, fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. 2 forms of the disease can follow. People with furious rabies exhibit signs of hyperactivity, excited behaviour, hydrophobia and sometimes aerophobia. After a few days, death occurs by cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies accounts for about 30 percent of the total number of human cases.\n\nNo tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease, and unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, the clinical diagnosis may be difficult. Human rabies can be confirmed intra-vitam and post mortem by various diagnostic techniques aimed at detecting whole virus, viral antigens or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin, urine or saliva). [See: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/index.html].\n\nThe preceding press report does not identify the type of test used to establish the diagnosis. The incubation period for rabies virus infection in humans is typically 1-3 months, but may range from less than one week to more than one year, depending among other things on on the site and size of the initial wound. The report lacks information on the date of arrival of the patient in Beijing or the length of his stay India [or elsewhere]. Hence it cannot be determined whether he contracted infection prior to or after his arrival in Beijing. It is also possible that he may have been infected elsewhere (possibly even in Israel) prior to his arrival in India.

Their interests will be represented by the Kerch\nUnion of trade and fishing sailors.\n\nAccording to the representative of the Union, the situation on\n\"Roksolana\" is a repetition of the story on \"Odysk\". Moreover, the\nship has the same structure as the \"Odysk\", and in both ships the\nilluminators [windows] of the crewmembers open to the corridor and\nnot to the outside.\n\nThe preliminary information is that the gas came from the cargo section.\n\nThe sailors asked the Union to represent them as they consider that\nthe contract they signed does not provide fair compensation.\n\nLet's remember that after the previous incident with the ship \"Odysk\",\nthe sailors received USD 10 000 each and the families of the deceased\nreceived USD 50 000, twice the amount stated in the contracts.\n\nAccording to \"Noviy Region\" the ship \"Roksolana\" sailed under the\nflag of Belize with 11 crewmembers on board and carrying 1641 tons of\ngrain. On the morning of 16 Mar 2008, the captain of the ship asked\nfor help after he found a dead sailor and 4 others poisoned. After\nthe evacuation of the crew, the members of the group for radiation\nand chemical protection took samples of the air from the ship's\ninterior. The concentration of poisonous agents in the air was 200\ntimes higher than the safety limit. The specialists stated that it\nwas poisoning with phosphine. The ship had been treated with\n[fumigating agents] against insects and rats. It is the 3rd case of\nthe same kind on the Crimean coast.\n\n[Byline: Anna Marikhu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Correspondents ATS/VM\n\n[The reported case is the 3rd after a planned treatment of the ships\nwith fumigating agents. This kind of work needs careful safety\nprocedures and proper instruction. The ship owners have to provide\nspecial protective outerwear and respiratory equipment for\nanti-rodent treatment. - Corr.VM\n\nPhosphine gas is frequently used in the grain industry for fumigating\ngrain, especially grains that are held for any period of time. The\nfumigation decreases weevils and rodents preying on the grain.\n\nPhosphine gas is a colorless, inflammable gas with carbide or\nfish-like odor and some describe it as a garlic-like odor. It is most\nfrequently toxic by inhalation. The amount that is toxic is relative\nto the species inhaling it. The amount per cubic meter and the length\nof time of exposure govern the toxicity. The higher the amount means\nthe lower the time necessary to cause toxicity and conversely, the\nlower the amount per cubic meter the longer the time of exposure\nrequired to produce intoxication. The levels are not cumulative.\n\nPhosphine is most often sold in the form of aluminium phosphide,\ncalcium phosphide, or zinc phosphide pellets. Phosphine is released\nwhen it encounters moisture, such as atmospheric moisture or gastric\nacid in the stomach of rodents.\n\nIf the crew believed there were fish on board then they may not have\nthought a fishy odor to be odd. However, with the grain off-gassing\nin the ship's hold and no outside ventilation for the crew, this was\na set up for a deadly situation.\n\nPhosphine is a very toxic gas, and is also generated as a by-product\nduring the manufacturing of methamphetamine. - Mod.TG]\nSee Also\nPoisoning, agent unknown - Ukraine: (Yalta) 20080321.1081\n2007\n----\nPhosphine, fatal - Ukraine (Yalta) 20070114.0189\n........................................tg/mj/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Despite a great deal\nof research on the physiology, reproductive biology, and diet of\npandas in the wild and in captivity, there is little information on\nwild panda mortality. Here, we integrate previously unavailable data\non mortality of wild pandas. We report 3 recent phases of panda\nmortality: deaths due to bamboo flowering in the 1970s and 1980s;\nsurprisingly extensive poaching in the 1980s and 1990s; and the\ngrowing importance of a parasitic infection over the past few years.\nOur analyses suggest that the current most significant threat to wild\npanda survival is disease due to extra-intestinal migration (visceral\nlarva migrans) of an ascarid nematode. We demonstrate that the\nprobability of death of wild pandas being caused by this disease\nincreased significantly between 1971 and 2006 and discuss the\npossible factors leading to the emergence of this disease.\n\n[Jin-Shuo Zhang (1,2), Peter Daszak (3), Hua-Li Huang (4), Guang-You\nYang (5), A.

But if the bears live together in\nconfined spaces, contagious diseases can quickly spread.\n\nA delegate who asked not to be named said 10 pandas at the Wolong\nNature Reserve this year [2007] became infected with a rare\ncontagious disease from which 2 of them later died [Could the nature\nof the suspected \"rare\" disease be specified? Clinical signs,\nlaboratory tests etc. will be helpful. - Mod.AS].\n\nVets from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, where\nZhang is based, worked with staff from Wolong to treat the sick\npandas but failed to diagnose the ailment, he said.\n\nYang said that in an effort to prevent the spread of potentially\nfatal diseases, additional enclosures for the bears will be built at\nboth Chengdu and Wolong.\n\nThe State Forestry Administration recently gave Wolong 20 million\nyuan [USD 2.7 million] to build 40 new dens some 20 km from its\nexisting ones. The Chengdu base is currently considering possible\nsites for its new compounds, he said.\n\nYang also warned of the danger of bamboo flowering, which, since\n2005, has expanded to an area of 24 000 hectares in Sichuan, about\n1.4 percent of the edible bamboo in the province, he told China Daily.\n\nNine varieties of bamboo have been seen flowering, which account for\nabout 30 percent of the varieties eaten by pandas.\n\nIn the 1980s, in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, extensive\nblossoming of the arrow bamboo -- the pandas' favorite -- led to many\nbears dying of disease and starvation, Yang said.\n\nThis year [2007], to avoid a recurrence, the Sichuan provincial\nforestry bureau has developed an emergency response plan and asked\nlocal forestry bureaus to implement it in the event of extensive\nblossoming.\n\nYang said that if 15 percent of the total bamboo area or 100 percent\nof a single variety is found to be flowering, all bears in that area\nwill be inoculated and/or relocated to ensure their safety.\n\nOften referred to as living fossils, giant pandas are found mainly in\nSichuan, which is home to about 1200 of them, or 76 percent of the\ncountry's total.\n\nMore than 80 officials and experts from animal protection\norganizations in 8 countries attended this year's [2007] conference.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver\n\n[For Bill Karesh's commentary, see 20071114.3691. - Mod.AS]\nSee Also\nUnknown illness, giant pandas - China (02) 20071115.3709\nUnknown illness, giant pandas - China: RFI 20071114.3691\n.............................................arn/msp/lm\n\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Rappt.DS, edited]\n<http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2007-11-12/114512888303s.shtml>\n\n\nAt the opening of the 18th Annual Conference of the Chinese Committee\nof Breeding Techniques for Giant Pandas in Chengdu, Sichuan,\nresearcher Zhihe Zhang, director of the Committee, presented this\nyear's [2007] Committee work report to the conference.\n\nIt was stated at the conference that there has been an outbreak of an\nunknown infectious disease among pandas in some nature reserves and\nprotective units in China this year [2007]. The health and safety of\nthe captive and wild giant panda species has therefore become a key\nissue at this year's conference.\n\n\"Small scale outbreak[s] of disease this year [2007] in China alert\nus to the need to pay active attention to the safety of the [giant\npanda] population.\" Zhihe Zhang stated that population safety is one\nof the most important issues affecting the survival of the giant\npanda. To avoid the emergence of vicious infectious diseases similar\nto SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] or avian influenza in the\ngiant panda population, it is extremely important to immediately\nstrengthen monitoring, prevention, and treatment/research of canine\ndistemper virus and other known and unknown infectious diseases. It\nis also extremely urgent to organize response teams, equipment, and\nemergency systems.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver\n\n[ProMED-mail has heard little regarding disease in giant pandas and\nhas referred this story to William Karesh of the Wildlife\nConservation Society for further comment. - Ed.LM]\n\n[Unfortunately, the news report provides little for interpretation.\nIf indeed the problems being mentioned are due to an infectious\ndisease, there are quite a few that have been reported over the years\nthat can infect giant pandas. Serological evidence of exposure to\ncanine viruses such as morbillivirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, and\ncoronavirus has been reported. Of course, test validation for pandas\nis unlikely and the possibility of cross-reaction to related viruses\nis quite possible. Bacterial septicemias due to _E. coli_ have been\nreported in captive pandas also.\n\nGiven the behavioral ecology (mostly solitary animals except during\nan extremely brief breeding season and living at low densities)\ncontact rates among wild pandas would be very low. Though not\nimpossible, it would seem unlikely that that same infectious agent\nwas spreading among pandas unless it had an extremely long incubation\nand/or period of shedding and not rapidly fatal. More likely is that\nthey are being exposed to organisms from other species, including\ndomestic animals that may be contaminating the limited remaining\npanda habitat, which may lead to cross-species transmission of the\nagents. Non-infectious causes such as environmental contaminants\nshould not be completely discounted either.\n\nPossibly, the more valuable piece of information in this news report\nis the official recognition for the need for better surveillance and\nresponse teams to investigate morbidity and mortality. If coordinated\nwith local domestic animal health monitoring or reporting systems\naround protected areas, it may shed light on prevalence of a number\nof diseases and sources of infection.\n\nWilliam B.

There have now been 10 cases reported in 2007,\nwhich is more than a quarter of the average yearly total.\n\"Here in SA, we get around 30 to 40 cases of all strains of _E. coli_\neach year,\" he said. \"These cases are usually quite sporadic and\noccur throughout the year. \"When we get a lot of cases occurring at\nonce and they seem to be linked in some way, then I guess we call\nthis an outbreak,\" Dr. Buckett said.\nHe said the fact that the infected people lived in different areas --\nincluding one in regional SA -- and were aged between 2 and 81 years\nof age, made identifying common links difficult.\nFlinders University gastroenterologist Professor Graeme Young said\nfinding the cause of the outbreak would involve a degree of\n\"detective work\". \"I think that if there isn't a common factor\nbetween the people, it makes it very hard to understand why this is\nhappening,\" Professor Young said.\n[Byline: Jessica Leo]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nSee Also\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia (SA)(02) 20070128.0366\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia (SA) 20070125.0328\nE. coli O157, lettuce - USA (multistate): 2006 20070112.0158\n2006\n----\nE. coli O157, fast food - USA (multistate) (05): lettuce 20061214.3516\nE. coli O157, fast food - USA (IA,MN): lettuce 20061214.3515\nE. coli O157, fast food - USA (multistate): green onions 20061206.3441\nE. coli O157 - USA (NJ, NY) 20061205.3425\nE. coli O157 - USA (NJ) 20061203.3415\nE. coli O157, spinach - USA (multistate)(20) 20061027.3067\nE. coli O157, spinach - USA (multistate): alert 20060915.2608\nE. coli O157, day care - USA (TN) 20060701.1823\nE. coli O157 - USA (multistate): unknown source 20060410.1068\nE. coli O157, unpasteurized milk - USA (OR,WA)(04) 20060121.0199\n2005\n----\nHemolytic uremic syndrome, petting zoo - USA (FL)(08) 20050408.1021\nE. coli O157, unpasteurized milk - USA (OR,WA) 20051216.3622\nE. coli O157 - USA (HI): alert 20050830.2564\nE. coli O157, lake swimming - USA (MN) 20050712.1983\nE. coli O157, ground beef - USA (multistate): recall 20050610.1612\nE. coli O157, religious camp - USA (OR)(02) 20050602.1540\nE. coli O157, religious camp - USA (OR) 20050531.1504\n1999\n----\nE. coli, hemolytic uremic syndrome - USA (Connecticut) 19990807.1368\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Argentina 19990405.0556\n1998\n----\nE. coli, hemolytic uremic syndrome - USA (Georgia)(04) 19980820.1667\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia (02) 19980430.0839\nHemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia 19980429.0827\n1996\n----\nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome (2) 19960221.0334\nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome 19960220.0327\n................................ll/mj/lm\n\n--\nLarry Madoff, M.D.\nEditor, ProMED-mail\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The animals' numbers have further dwindled\ndue to poaching, open wells that act as death traps and human\nencroachment on lion habitat.\nLions are killed for their pelts and claws, both of which command a\nhuge price in the illegal wildlife trade.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Is the progeny suffering from a lethal genetic disease or from a\ngenetic susceptibility to a prevailing infectious disease?\nMore information on the outcome of this, clearly unsuccessful\nbreeding project, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]\n.............lm/mpp/arn/msp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There is no link to a\nspecific product, but illnesses from this pathogen can be associated\nwith consumption of raw or undercooked ground beef. Illnesses have\nbeen found in California, Iowa, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Rhode\nIsland and Wisconsin. These illnesses occurred over a 6-month period,\nbeginning in September 2005 through March 2006, and FSIS is working\nclosely with State and local health officials to determine the\nexposure that led to illness.\nTherefore, FSIS wants to remind all consumers of the proper handling\nand cooking of meat products. Safe steps in food handling, cooking,\nand storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. Consumers\nshould follow the 4 guidelines to keep food safe:\n1. Clean: Wash hands and surfaces often. Wash your hands with warm,\nsoapy water for 20 seconds before and after handling food. Wash your\ncutting boards, dishes, etc. with hot, soapy water after preparing\neach food item. Wash fruits and vegetables with cold water before\nusing. There is no need to wash or rinse meat or poultry.\n2. Separate: Don't cross-contaminate. Separate raw, cooked, and\nready-to-eat foods while shopping, preparing, or storing. Never place\ncooked food on a plate which previously held raw meat, poultry, or\nseafood.\n3. Cook: Cook food to proper temperatures. To be sure bacteria and\npathogens are destroyed, cook ground beef products to 160 F. Use a\nfood thermometer to be sure!\n4. Chill: Refrigerate promptly. Refrigerate or freeze perishables,\nprepared foods, and leftovers within 2 hours or sooner.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Matching microbiological profiles (presumably genetic matches)\noccurring over 6 months and scattered across the USA suggest a common\nreservoir that is nonperishable, such as frozen ground beef rather\nthan unpasteurized milk or produce.

Local media quoted prosecutors as saying the gas was methyl\nmercaptan, a compound added to domestic gas to give it its odor,\nwhich is poisonous in large quantities.\n\"[Suspicious] containers with pipes were found in 2 other shops; they\nare being defused,\" said Andrei Alyabyev, spokesman for the\nEmergencies Ministry.

[CDC's]MMWR\nreported 93 cases in 2003 and 82 cases in 2004. The disease is not\nreportable in all states, so there may be a few more.\n\nIt is hard to understand why 7 to 10 days are needed to confirm the\ndiagnosis. While the disease is often misdiagnosed, once it is\nsuspected, a competent dermatopathologist should be able to confirm\nthe diagnosis.\n\nIsolation is generally not used for patients with Hansen's disease in\nthe USA. While there are differences of opinion with regard to the\ndegree of contagiousness, most people have natural immunity, and the\ninstitution of antimicrobial therapy quickly reduces the risk of\ntransmission.\n\n--\nRichard I. Frankel, MD, MPH\nVA Pacific Islands Health Care System\nProfessor Emeritus, University of Hawaii\nHonolulu, HI\n<Richard.Frankel@med.va.gov>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. Frankel for his comments.\n\nWhere the inmate spent his life from youth to incarceration is not\nstated. The Levis and Ernst chapter referenced below (1) reports\nthat in 2002, WHO reported over 600 000 new cases of leprosy, also\ncalled Hansen's disease (which as Dr. Frankel states is the preferred\nterminology), with the largest number of cases originating in South\nAsia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar). Africa and the Americas\neach reported about 40 000 new cases, with most of the Americas cases\nfrom Brazil.\n\nLevis and Ernst also note that _Mycobacterium leprae_ was the 1st\nbacterium to be associated with a disease. The Norwegian Armauer\nHansen discovered the organism in 1874 just prior to Koch's discovery\nof the the tubercle bacillus. The inability to cultivate _M. leprae_\non artificial media (which persists today) allowed Koch to be\ncredited with the discovery opening the germ theory of disease.\n\nIn the USA, _M. leprae_ is known to have been transmitted in several\nstates: Louisiana, Texas, Hawaii, and possibly California. 2 cases\nhave been reported, however, in residents of the eastern USA who had\nno obvious history of relevant travel or exposure (2).\n\n1.

He explained that even though both physicians and paramedics\nassume that the condition has an environmental origin, all affected\npersons claim to have allergic and respiratory symptoms. He recalled\nthat some time ago the same phenomenon occurred in this area, but the\nauthorities could not determine its origin. The Fire Chief stated\nthat no one will be allowed on the beaches in the next 48 hours.\nA decree by the State Governor prohibited the use of the affected\nareas in order to prevent a recurrence. This decree affects all\nbeaches, including those located at the Vargas State border.\n[In the previous instance,] some physicians put the blame in the\nPDVSA [the Venezuelan national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela]\nfacility located at Carenero for putting out toxic waste, but this\ncould not be proven. For this reason, the occurrence was never\nexplained. Dr. Miguel Mejias, Health Director of Miranda State,\npointed out that some samples had been sent to Coche hospital and\nthat some other samples are being tested at different epidemiological\ncenters. They hope to determine the origin of these toxic effects.\nHe explained that if there is a contaminating agent, it might be a\nvolatile compound; i.e. something in the air. For this reason, they\nbelieve that the contaminant is not in the beaches themselves.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Despite the initial indications that this was a case of\ncontamination caused by oil derivatives from a nearby facility,\nneither local nor national sanitary authorities have been able to\ndetermine the nature of the problem.

The pathogen causes wheat leaves to yellow\nand die, but it's not caused by wheat streak mosaic, head death or\nfreezing.\n\"We're pretty sure it's a virus,\" said wheat breeder Joe Martin, who\nworks at the Kansas State University research station at Hays. \"It\nshowed up early and, at first glance, we thought it was wheat streak\nmosaic. But it's not. It kills the oldest leaves of the plant and\nfinally kills the head.\" Researchers don't know what the virus is,\nwhere it came from, or how it spreads.\nMartin said he's seen evidence of the virus in almost every field\nhe's checked in western Kansas, but it hasn't taken over the crop. He\nencouraged farmers to be on the lookout when checking their fields.\nDallas Seifers, a plant pathology professor at Fort Hays State\nUniversity, is trying to determine how the pathogen works, and what\nit might be.\n\"It's possible that this is something that has been identified\nsomewhere else in the world, even something that has shown up in a\ndifferent crop, corn or rice or something,\" Seifers said.\nSeifers, with the help of some virologists in Winnipeg, Canada, is\ntrying to identify the protein that causes the virus' symptoms. That\nwork is complicated by the fact that most affected plants found in\nthe field are already dead. Seifers is trying to grow his own supply\nof infected plants to study, but the effort hasn't been as successful\nas he hoped.\nOnce researchers identify the protein's genetic sequence, they can\ncompare it to known pathogens to find a match, or one that is in the\nsame family.\nSeifers said it's possible that the virus is showing up now because\nof recent unusual weather patterns, and that it wouldn't show up in a\nnormal year.\n\"We're just happy that it is not in large enough numbers to have an\neconomic impact this year, and we hope it will be spotty if it shows\nup next year,\" he said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A 28-kD protein has been specifically associated with infected\nplants.

AIMS scientists working in the long-term monitoring\nprogram say the disease they have documented is in a broad category\nknown as White Syndrome. Soon they hope to learn exactly what White\nSyndrome is.\nCathie Page, a deep ocean ecologist on the AIMS long term monitoring\nteam, says, \"It's more common on table corals. It starts at the base\nand works its way up. The disease breaks the coral tissue down,\neventually killing it.\"\n\"It doesn't fit the description of diseases found anywhere else in\nthe world, so it might be specific to the Pacific,\" she says. In the\n3 years Page has been on the monitoring team, she has logged about\n450 dives spanning 48 reefs. She has seen White Syndrome kill at\nvarying rates.\n\"It could kill a colony of 2 metres (6.5 feet) in diameter in 2 weeks\nbut in some other cases, it takes months to kill a large colony,\" she\nsaid.\nThe first record of coral diseases came from reefs off Belize and\nFlorida in 1973. In 1993 coral diseases were noticed on the Great\nBarrier Reef. When the diseases worsened in the late 1990s, the\nlong-term monitoring team started documenting their activity. In\n1999 only 7 reefs were infected with White Syndrome; in 2002 33\nreefs were affected out of the 48 studied by the AIMS long-term\nmonitoring team.\nThe highest number of infected colonies within one reef was 101 in a\n1500-square-meter area. That was on Carter Reef, an outer shelf reef\nin the Cooktown/Lizard Island sector. The syndrome killed those\ncolonies infected and caused a decline in hard coral cover on this\nreef.\nAIMS scientists together with researchers from James Cook University\nwho are collaborating on the project have recorded the disease in\nnorthern waters during the winter months. Outer-shelf reefs near\nLizard Island off Cooktown in the northern Great Barrier Reef and the\nCapricorn Bunker reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef are the\nworst affected areas.\nWhite Syndrome outbreaks are happening in pristine areas of the Great\nBarrier Reef, the AIMS teams says, on outer reefs untouched by\ncoastal development and tourism. This means the reef diseases are not\nlinked to pollution, as are other coral diseases around the world.\nCoral bleaching is also affecting the great reef, and scientists fear\nWhite Syndrome could be spreading more quickly in corals weakened by\nbleaching.\nCoral bleaching is the name given to an event in which coral expel\ntheir symbiotic algae due to extreme stress, such as unusually hot\nwater, according to AIMS bleaching expert Dr. Terry Done.\nThe bleached corals die if the stress is extreme or prolonged. With\nrising water temperatures over the tropical summers, coral bleaching\nevents are more widespread and happening more often, leaving little\ntime for coral to recover.\n\"Bleached coral is not healthy and potentially more susceptible to\ndiseases,\" said Page. \"We don't know what's causing this disease.\nIt's microscopic; it could be a range of things.\"\nAIMS has sent samples of corals affected by White Syndrome away for\ntesting. When the results come back, AIMS will search for solutions\nthat might save the corals of the Great Barrier Reef.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The coral reef bleaching is a serious problem for the ocean life\nthat live in and around the reef, but the devastation of the reef has\nconsequences for the land mass that the reef protects as well. There\nare many theories, including the rise in ocean water temperatures as\nreflected by our warming climate, a potential effect of El Nino, and\neven contamination due to human waste. It may be a combination of\nthese that has allowed the problem to escalate, but whatever the\ncause, it is affecting the reefs on almost a worldwide basis. -\nMod.TG]\nSee Also\nCoral reef kills, human waste suspected - Caribbean 20020627.4622\nBlack water, unknown cause - USA (Florida): RFI 20020321.3787\n2000\n----\nCoral reef kills - Belize 20000510.0713\n1999\n----\nCoral reef kills & potential human disease (02) 19990204.0161\nCoral reef kills & potential human disease 19990124.0111\n1998\n----\nCoral reef bleaching & El Nino - Indian Ocean (02) 19981113.2187\nRed tide advisory - Brunei 19980820.1668\nCoral reef bleaching, El Nino effects - Indian Ocean 19980705.1246\nCoral reef kills, etiology determined - USA 19980415.0693\n.............................tg/pg/lm\n*##########################################################*\n* *\n* Please support the 2002 ProMED-mail Internet-a-thon! *\n* http://www.isid.org/netathon2002.shtml *\n* *\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

A sixth person was treated\nand released. The six went into respiratory arrest after eating dinner in a\nYonkers apartment. Others in the apartment who did not eat the meal did not\nbecome sick, the police said.\nBecause an ambulance worker developed a rash after lifting one of the\nvictims, the police initially thought the incident could have been a far\nmore serious outbreak or attack. The rash is now believed to have been\neither a coincidence or a result of contact with a victim's bodily fluids.\nUntil medical officials can pinpoint the cause of the illness, the\nauthorities are treating the case as a possible crime. \"We are looking at\nsubstances in the food,\" said the Yonkers police commissioner, Charles A.\nCola. \"There are preservatives that can cause these symptoms. But at this\nlate date, we can say it wasn't cyanide.\"\nThe police responded to a call at 6:17 Thursday night for what appeared to\nbe an incident of food poisoning in a modest four-story row house, not far\nfrom the city's downtown. But because of the severity of the symptoms and\nthe skin reaction of the medical technician, city officials went into full\ncrisis mode.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Westchester County district\nattorney's office and a team of hazardous materials experts were all called\nin. The neighborhood surrounding the apartment building was closed off, as\nwas St. Joseph's emergency room. And the American Red Cross started to set\nup an emergency shelter at a nearby church.\n\"We're dealing with so many unknowns in our society, as we're all painfully\naware of,\" Mayor John D. Spencer said at a news conference. \"As a\ngovernment, as a city, we have to be prepared to be overly cautious when\ndealing with issues such as chemicals or strange occurrences, which this\nwas yesterday.\"\nThe six victims \u0097 four men and two women of Egyptian heritage who range in\nage from 23 to 60 \u0097 apparently used some ingredients that were brought to\nthe United States from Egypt, Commissioner Cola said. \"Right now I'm\nleaning toward this being a non-crime, based on medical advice that it\ncould have happened naturally,\" he said.\nThere was no move to recall any particular food item because a number of\ningredients were used in the dinner. \"We don't know what it is, so how do I\nsay, `It's the A.& P.'?\" Commissioner Cola said.\nDr. Nicholas E. DeRobertis, director of emergency services at St. Joseph's\nMedical Center, said the list of substances that could provoke such a\nreaction was \"pretty extensive,\" including certain antibiotics and food\npreservatives. The patients suffered from a condition he called\nmethemoglobinemia, which changes the red blood cells so that they cannot\ncarry oxygen to the body's tissues.\n\"When that happens, people come in with severe respiratory distress, a\nbluish color and altered mental state,\" Dr. DeRobertis said at the news\nconference.\nMr. Cola said the patients were immediately given an antidote for cyanide\npoisoning as a precaution.\nFoods from the meal were being tested at a federal Food and Drug\nAdministration laboratory in Queens, said Heather McGill, a spokeswoman for\nthe Westchester County Health Department. It was not known when the test\nresults would be made available, she said.\n[Byline: Lisa W. Foderaro]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[2]\nDate: Date: Fri, 17 May 2002 16:14:11 -0700\nFrom: \"Carol H.

The police commissioner said he doubted there had been any foul\nplay. Two of the victims remained in critical condition a day after the\noutbreak of a rare blood-cell disease. Three were in stable condition and\none was released from the hospital.\n\"I'm leaning toward non-crime based on medical advice,\" said Commissioner\nCharles Cola. \"Nobody has told us this is something that somebody put in\nthe food.\" He added, however, that police were still treating the victims'\napartment as a crime scene and that \"It would be presumptuous of me to rule\nout foul play.\"\nMayor John Spencer said Yonkers was \"back to normalcy\" after spinning into\nemergency mode Thursday night. The six victims had been taken to St.\nJoseph's Medical Center with severe breathing problems, a bluish pallor and\nan altered mental state. Some emergency workers reported picking up a rash\nas they treated the patients, adding to the concern.\nThe hospital was closed briefly and police, firefighters,\nhazardous-materials workers and even anti-terrorist agents streamed into\nthe area. The mayor mentioned the possibility of cyanide poisoning. A\ndecontamination shower was set up outside the victims' home. Air tests in\nthe building and at the hospital found no airborne contamination, however.\nWhen police learned that people in the apartment who had not eaten did not\nget sick, the investigation focused on the food. Cola said the victims,\nwho were identified only as being adults and of Egyptian heritage, were at\na dinner party featuring a dish with many ingredients, including a\nprocessed food that they had brought in from Egypt.\n\"They became concerned about the taste of the food and quickly became ill,\"\nhe said. He said the investigation was concentrating \"on the apartment and\nthe food itself and the way it was prepared,\" rather than looking into\nwhether the victims had enemies who might have tampered with the food.\nDr. Nicholas DeRobertis, emergency director at St. Joseph's, said something\nthe victims ingested had changed their red blood cells into abnormal cells\nthat blocked the transfer of oxygen to tissue, a condition called\nmethemoglobinemia. It is unlike ordinary food poisoning, he said, in that\nit is a respiratory rather than gastrointestinal illness. He said he had\nseen it only once before, 15 or 20 years ago.\nThe doctor said the condition has more than 100 known causes, including\nunsafe levels of nitroglycerin; the antibiotics known as sulfonamides; or\nnaphthalene, which is used in mothballs. It is also used in some food\npreservatives, he said, but in that form would have to be ingested in \"very\nlarge quantities\" to inflict the illness. He said tests that might show if\nthe food was tampered with could take weeks. The mayor said it was\npremature to try recalls or other warnings about tainted food because\n\"there could be 100 different ways\" that the toxin got into the food.\n[By Jim Fitzgerald]\n--\nCarol H. Knott\n<ctn43074@centurytel.net>\n\n[The earlier reports on this event suggested cyanide poisoning and then\nlater botulism. The present reports state that the clinical picture was\nconsistent with methemoglobinemia. Cyanide poisoning can present with a\nclinical picture similar to that seen with acquired methemoglobinemia. The\nearlier report on possible botulism is difficult to understand other than a\nclinical presentation of respiratory distress. A good review of\nmethemoglobinemia can be found at the Vanderbilt Medical College website:\n<http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/peds/pidl/hemeonc/index.htm>\nMethemoglobin is an abnormal hemoglobin that is not capable of carrying\noxygen or carbon dioxide. In adults and normal children the level of\nmethemoglobin is less than 1% of the total hemoglobin. Acquired\nmethemoglobinemia (presence of methemoglobin in the blood) results when the\nrate of formation of methemoglobin exceeds the rate of reduction after\nexposure to certain compounds. Nitrites and aniline derivatives are\nsubstances which most frequently produce methemoglobinemia. Because of its\nuse as a meat preservative and its similarity in appearance to table salt,\nsodium nitrite is frequently the cause of methemoglobinemia. Nitrites are\nalso present in many medicinal agents. Mosts reports of nitrate- induced\nmethemoglobinemia, however, are due to infants fed well water contaminated\nwith high levels of nitrates. Nitrate salts are converted by enteric\nbacteria to nitrites which are then rapidly absorbed from the\ngastrointestinal tract. Silver nitrate used on burns is also a common\nsource as bacteria infecting burns may similarly cause nitrite production.\nAniline and its derivitives are found in many household products such as\ninks, shoe polishes, paints and varnishes, and in some red and orange wax\ncrayons. Other drugs commonly associated with methemoglobinemia include\nphenacetin, sulfonamides, and pyridium. Benzocaine, a common ingredient of\ntopical anesthetics has also been known to cause marked cyanosis from\nmethemoglobinemia.\nSymptoms of methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, coma, and death.\nHeadache, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heartrate), weakness and dizziness do\nnot appear until levels reach 30- 40%. At 50- 60% oxygenation of tissues\nbecomes truly inadequate resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath),\nacidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), coma, and convulsions.\nDeath occurs with concentrations of about 70% and greater. Treatment\ninvolves general supportive care and removal of any offending toxins. The\ndrug of choice for treating severe methemoglobinemia is methylene\nblue. Severe cases may require exchange transfusion or the use of\nascorbic acid.\nMethemoglobinemia has been associated with ingestion of food products\ncontaining toxic levels of nitrites/nitrates or other substances. An\noutbreak in India (ref.1) was associated with ingestion of rice\ncontaminated with metanil yellow used for coloring the rice. Other\noutbreaks have been associated with the use of excessive amounts of sodium\nnitrate (saltpetre) in the preparation of sausages and other meat products\n(refs. 2,3).\nMore information on the etiology of the methemoglobinemia in this outbreak\nwould be appreciated.\n1: Sachdeva SM, Mani KV, Adaval SK, Jalpota YP, Rasela KC, Chadha\nDS.

They've dubbed it\n\"black water\", and have called local, state, and national government\nagencies to investigate.\nScientists who have heard of the phenomenon say they need answers too.\"It's\nkilled a lot of the bottom because recently a lot of little bottom plants\nare coming to the surface dead and rotten out in the Gulf,\" said Tim\nDaniels, 58, a Marathon Key fish-spotting pilot who has been flying over\nthe Gulf for more than 20 years. Experienced fishermen say they've often\nseen red tide but they've never seen anything like this \"it doesn't have a\nfoul smell, it isn't red tide and it isn't oil. They describe it as viscous\nand slimy water with what looks like spider webs in it.\"\nFirst sighted in January, the mass of black-colored water reached from 20\nmiles north of Marathon Key halfway to Naples. It stretched west almost 20\nmiles into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThough somewhat smaller now than descriptions from January, the mass of\nwater is still quite large and is moving into the Florida Keys National\nMarine Sanctuary, a 2800 square-mile sanctuary adjacent to the Keys, which\nis the largest coral reef in the United States. It includes the productive\nwaters of Florida Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean. Part of\nthe ecosystem is an extensive nursery, feeding, and breeding ground,\nsupporting a variety of marine species and a multimillion dollar fishing\nindustry bringing in almost 20 million pounds of seafood each year.\nBilly Causey, superintendent of the sanctuary, told the Naples Daily News\nrecently that there is real concern in the scientific community about the\noverall health of the Gulf. Causey said contributing to the problems\nafflicting the shallow body is global warming, extended periods when the\nGulf waters aren't cooling in the winter, and the growing impact of human\nactivity along coastlines. Those problems, beginning in the early 1980s,\ninclude more frequent and longer lasting coral bleaching events that by\n1990 were affecting stouter coral reefs closer to shore and more adapted to\nwide temperature swings.\n\"There are places that are still beautiful but the shallow reefs would make\nyou cry,\" said Causey, a Keys diver since the 1950s. Scientists with Mote\nMarine Laboratory based in Sarasota said they are aware of the black water\nphenomenon but have not yet been able to test water samples. Mote is\nwilling to send out testing kits to fishermen who might encounter the black\nwater zone but, in the absence of a kit, fishermen could put a sample in a\nclean bottle and keep it in a cool, dark place until they could get it to a\nlab.\nDaniels said he first noticed the black water when he went out in\nmid-January, ahead of kingfish season, to see what fishermen had in store\nfor 2002. When he was flying over water that was 50 feet deep and north of\nthe Keys, Daniels began to notice a change in the water color. When pilots\nfrom the air see boats move through a red tide zone, they often cut the\nreddish or brownish water to reveal green below. That doesn't occur in the\nblack water. \"This (dark) stuff goes all the way to the bottom,\" Richardson\nsaid. Boats that have 4 to 5 feet of hull below the surface cut through 35\nto 40 feet of water and leave nothing but the same black water in their\nwakes. It's the same at depths of 15 feet, he said.\nAlong with the newly discovered black water and coral bleaching, there have\nbeen other problems with the Gulf having been documented for years. They\ninclude a New Jersey-sized dead zone coming off the Mississippi River\noutlet to the Gulf that consumes a larger area each summer. There are\nincidences of a contamination known as fibro papilloma [any information\nabout this condition? - Mod.SH] in green turtles that live in Florida Bay.\nThere are other problems in shrimp and an entire marine ecosystem appears\nto be sick.\n\u00ad\u00ad\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The black water is a mystery requiring more water testing but apparently\ndefying life.

There were 16 people doing volunteer\nwork at the monument, half of them digging in an Indian sweat cave off the\nmonument's main road and the other half working on the quarter-mile trail\nleading to the cave, called the \"Swelter Shelter.\"\nThe 8 volunteers, including one from inside the cave and 7 from the trail,\nwere taken to Ashley Valley Medical Center in Vernal. All but 2 were\nreleased Tuesday, according to Joseph B. Shaffer, director of the\nTri-County Health Department, which is investigating the mysterious\nillness. The 2 still in the hospital are being held for observation at\nleast through Wednesday.\nHealth officials ruled out bubonic plague, hantavirus [infection, and\ndeer-fly bites [which are known to transmit tularemia as possible causes.\nThe volunteers have been treated for fungal and bacterial infection,\nShaffer said. The fungal infection comes from the soil, with no possible\nperson-to-person transmission.\nAll 16 of the volunteers who became ill high school graduates and college\nstudents were from outside the area. They came from Alaska, Florida,\nKansas, Vermont, Virginia, and one from Poland. Volunteers from Utah and\nColorado were not affected. \"My suspicion is we develop a lot of immunities\nto things that knock people out who are not living here,\" Shaffer said.\nThe investigation team includes representatives from the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and local and state health officials. None\nof the young adults is in danger, said Shaffer, who praised the \"great\ncooperation\" between the hospital and public health officials in launching\nan immediate investigation.\n[Byline: Lois M. Collins\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The preceding article does not specify the clinical syndromes other than\nto mention \"flu-like illness\" and suggest the involvement of a fungal\netiology. Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis are\nillnesses that present with flu-like symptoms, and are infections with\ndimorphic fungi found in the soil in the USA, and could be responsible for\nthese outbreaks.\nHistoplasmosis is caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_ . According to Gideon\n<http://www.gideononline.com>: histoplasmosis was first reported in the\nUnited States in 1926. The disease is endemic to the Ohio, Mississippi, and\nMissouri River valley areas, with highest rates in Kentucky, Illinois,\nIndiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee. Although the endemic area for\nblastomycosis overlaps that of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found\nfurther north, and not as far to the west as histoplasmosis. In 1969, it\nwas estimated that 40 million Americans were infected [with\nhistoplasmosis, with 200 000 cases of acute pulmonary disease per year.\nSkin test-positivity rates approach 95% in areas of South Kentucky and\nMiddle Tennessee; 80% to 90% in Kansas City (adults over age 20, 1963).\nCoccidioidomycosis is caused by _Coccidioides immitis_. According to\nGideon: Coccidioidomycosis was first reported in the United States in 1893:\nThe disease is most common in California (the San Joaquin Valley), Arizona,\nTexas, New Mexico, southern Nevada, and Utah. The highest incidence occurs\nin late summer and early fall -- large outbreaks frequently follow dust\nstorms. An estimated 100 000 infections occur in the United States\nannually, and 1 in 200 infections progresses to disseminated disease.\nBlastomycosis is caused by _Blastomyces dermatitidis_. Most cases are\nreported from Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, and Wisconsin. Infection was first reported in Colorado in 1998.\nAlthough the endemic area for blastomycosis overlaps that of\nhistoplasmosis, blastomycosis is also found further north, and not as far\nto the west as histoplasmosis.\nBy geographic distribution, coccidioidomycosis would be the highest on the\nlist as possible etiologies followed by blastomycosis and then\nhistoplasmosis. Additional information on this outbreak would be\nappreciated. - Mod.MPP\n[While we are putting forward our best guesses, the history of cave\nexploration is of interest.

There, 3500 rainbow trout eggs from a\nCalifornia trout farm were left above a river bed for 2 weeks until eyes\ncould be seen. They were then taken to a lab, reared to the fry stage,\nand studied against trout raised only in a laboratory.\nOf 372 trout sampled, 34 percent exposed to Willamette River water for 2\nweeks had deformities compared with 9 percent of the fish raised in the\nlaboratory, the study found.\n\"The types of skeletal deformities we saw are the same type as with\nother fish\" having come out of the Willamette, EVS's Ellis said. In\naddition, prior studies have shown random samples of fish from the this\npart of the river have had deformity rates above 70 percent, scientists\nsaid.\nAbout 70 percent of Oregon's population lives within 20 miles of the\nWillamette River, making it an important symbol for Oregonians, Allen\nsaid, adding, \"This is a slap upside the head for Oregonians.\"\nThe river, which winds through the state's most populated areas, is also\nplanned as a source of drinking water for the town of Wilsonville in\n2002.\nEllis's firm is working on a study of the health risks of eating fish\ncaught on this stretch of the Willamette.\n\"We are still dumping a lot of chemicals in this part of the river,\"\nAllen said. \"A lot of people think this is stuff that happened 40 years\nago. Dumping [is] a current problem.\"\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[If they knew who was dumping chemicals, then something could perhaps\nmore easily be done. However, this research suggests there are a number\nof chemicals from different sources and for different reasons being\ndumped into the river.

Ed. DS] that causes skin rashes and affects the liver and\npancreas, he told a state investigative commission.\nHigh concentrations of nitrates have been found in 57 percent of drinking\nwater supplied through a pipe system, 98 percent of water from wells and\nevery tenth food product checked, Moskalenko said in comments cited by the\nInterfax news agency.\nOfficials said Ukraine would appeal to the World Health Organization and\nforeign governments to help it deal with the emergency. The government,\nmeanwhile, appeared split on what caused the illness, with some officials\nblaming rocket fuel and others denying the possibility. In the region is a\nbase holding solid-fuel SS-24 nuclear missiles, which are to be dismantled\nin 2001. It once housed other Soviet missiles powered by liquid fuel.\nHealth experts have said the area's soil and water contained substances\nthat are usually produced by decomposing rocket fuel, but Kuchma's\nspokesman Oleksandr Martynenko insisted on Wednesday that rocket fuel could\nnot be blamed. Instead, he suggested that the illness could have resulted\nfrom high amounts of nitrates in the soil. But the head of the government\ncommission, deputy premier Mykola Zhulynskyi, said missile silos in the\narea had remained open after liquid-fuel rockets were dismantled there in\nthe late 1970s. Fuel spills could have occurred during the missiles'\ndismantling, he said. Ukraine inherited 46 SS-24 and 130 SS-19 nuclear\nmissiles following the 1991 Soviet collapse. Kiev has since surrendered all\nits nuclear warheads to Russia and eliminated the last SS-19 missile in\n1999. Most of the SS-24s along with missile silos remain to be destroyed\nunder a disarmament plan running through 2001.\n[Byline: Sergei Shargorodsky]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n***\n[2]\nDate: 31 Aug 2000 20:38:33 -0400\nFrom: Marjorie P.

The Franklin County\nHealth Department says a fifth case of _E. coli_ [infection is being\nexamined along with more than two dozen cases from the southwestern portion\nof the state.\n\nParents of several children in two separate daycare centers on the west\nside of Columbus were told Wednesday to collect stool samples from their\nchildren after it was confirmed that four kids from those centers have the\ndangerous strain of _E. coli_ poisoning.\nThree kids from one daycare center and one from a neighboring center have\nbeen infected, possibly through dirty diapers. A fifth case was confirmed\nThursday in a 3 year old. That case was not related to those at the daycare\ncenters.\nThe Ohio Department of Health is concerned about a doubling of the usual\ncases of the bacteria in the Cincinnati area and says it may just be the\ntip of the iceberg, the beginning signs of a food poisoning outbreak whose\nsource health officials are completely unaware of.\nThe state health lab has about 20 samples from people who are sick with _E.\ncoli_ and is expecting more. Most of them are people from the Cincinnati\narea but officials are trying to determine of there is any connection with\nthe local cases. Eight cases in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and\nsix more in Butler County have been reported.\nThe Centers for Disease Control is also looking at three reported cases in\nKentucky and Indiana.\nDr. Bill Becker of the Ohio Department of Health says they\u0092re asking where\npeople have been, what they've been doing, and what they've been eating,\ntrying to track the source of the bacteria.\nDr. Becker says the ODH participated in a conference call with the Centers\nfor Disease Control Tuesday to discuss the possible associations. He says\nthe organizations are putting together a questionnaire to see if the cases\nin the Columbus and Cincinnati areas are related.\nThe first step is to fingerprint all of the samples from all of the people,\nwhich is done with a DNA screening. So far, two of the samples from\nsouthwest Ohio match.\nSamples from the five sick kids in central Ohio haven't been tested yet and\nthere are several more samples to fingerprint from the area around\nCincinnati before it can be determined if this is an outbreak.\nDoctors and other health professionals are being warned to keep their eyes\nopen for more cases and re-evaluate recent cases of patients with bloody\ndiarrhea, the hallmark sign of this deadly strain of _E. coli_ known as\nO157.H7.\nYoung children and older people are particularly susceptible to serious\nproblems with this strain of _E. coli_. Five to seven percent of the people\ninfected with this strain suffer kidney failure. Some of those die.\nWashing hands thoroughly and avoiding undercooked foods and unpasteurized\ndrinks can reduce a person\u0092s risk of becoming infected.\nPeople who have [toxigenic _E. coli_ [infections may suffer from severe\ndiarrhea, abdominal cramps\nand nausea. There is generally no fever associated with it.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[This report expands the outbreak to include 5 cases in the Columbus area.\nIt is as yet unclear whether all of the Ohio cases have a common source.\nIt is noteworthy that there has been a recall of beef patties issued by a\nnationwide distributor from New England because of _E. coli_ contamination,\nbut there is no indication that these products are related to the Ohio\noutbreak as yet. - Mods.ES/MPP\n...........................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Key test results are expected by week's end.\n- Hamilton County: 8 confirmed cases including 2 in Loveland, 2 in Indian\nHill, 2 in Anderson township, one each in Blue Ash and Symmes Township.\n- Butler county: 6 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases; includes 4 in\nFairfield, 2 in Liberty Township, one each in Union and Madison townships.\n- Clermont County: 6 confirmed cases, mostly in Union and Miami Townships\nnear the Hamilton County line.\nThe Ohio Department of Health and county departments of health [have\nindicated that:\nno deaths have occurred in the local cluster, but several victims were sick\nenough to require hospital care.\nAlthough the investigation is in its early stages, officials do not think\nall 20 people got sick from a single source of contamination, such as a\ngroup picnic or restaurant.\n\"It is really very unlikely that it's a single source,\" said Janet\nRickabaugh, Clermont County health commissioner. \"[The investigation could\ntake several weeks. And we may never find out much more information on the\nsource.\"\nTracking the source of a foodborne illness can be complicated, health\nofficials say. People don't always accurately remember what they eat and\nfinding samples of contaminated food can be elusive.\nThe 20 cases include eight in Hamilton County, six in Clermont County and\nsix in Butler County. All were diagnosed in June or July.\nThat's an unusually high number, even though health officials say summer is\nthe peak season for _E. coli_ infections. Those three counties reported a\ntotal of 11 cases in 1998, [according to Ohio Department of Health\nspokeswoman Jane Beathard.\nStatewide, 87 cases of _E. coli_ illnesses were reported this year through\nJuly 28, compared with 54 cases in the same period a year ago.\n_E. coli_ O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of _E. coli_ bacteria, many\nof which pose no threat to human health. The dangerous strain is commonly\npassed by eating undercooked beef. However, _E. coli_ outbreaks also have\nbeen linked to unpasteurized milk and apple juice, and raw alfalfa sprouts.\nThe [infection can be spread by failing to wash hands after using the\nrestroom or changing diapers, or by drinking or swimming in contaminated\nwater.\nTo find the source or sources of the local cluster, county health\ndepartments have been interviewing victims about what they ate and where.\nBacterial samples collected from the victims have been sent to the state\nhealth department for closer analysis.\nThree experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, brought\nin at the request of the state health department, arrived Wednesday. They\nwill be working from the Clermont County Health Department.\nBased on interviews with the people who became sick, food samples have been\ncollected from at least two restaurants, but no test results were available\nWednesday.\nThe state health department expects to have results by week's end from a\ntype of bacteria DNA testing called pulsed field gel electrophoresis.\nEven _E. coli_ O157:H7 can vary in subtle ways. The DNA test can tell much\nlike a fingerprint whether any of the 20 people caught the same variation\nof the strain.\nThe lack of common circumstances among the cases makes it likely that more\nthan one source of contamination was involved.\nIn Clermont County, none of the six victims were from the same family. In\nButler County, ages of victims ranged from 4 to 82. In Hamilton County,\nvictims lived in five different cities or townships, with ages ranging from\n4 to 63.\n\"We've been trying to find a common food source, but so far we haven't\nfound one,\" said Patricia Burg, director of the Butler County Health\nDepartment.\nNo new cases have been reported for several days, but it is too soon to\ntell whether the cluster is likely to grow beyond the 20 cases, Ms.\nBeathard said. The potential risk to the public depends on the cause or\ncauses of the illness.\nFranklin County has reported four recent _E. coli_ cases near Columbus but\nstate officials do not believe those cases are linked to the Greater\nCincinnati cases. Officials also are investigating three cases reported in\nKentucky and one in Indiana to see if they might be linked to the local\ncluster.\n[Byline: Tim Bonfield\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[This article suggests this outbreak may be bigger than just the southern\nportion of Ohio. There is a greater than 50% increase in reported cases as\nof 28 July this year from the same period in 1998 (87 vs 54 cases) of\nwhich only 61% are attributed to this cluster (20 of 33). In addition,\nthere is mention that 3 cases in Kentucky and one in Indiana are under\ninvestigation as possibly related to this cluster. One obvious question is\nwhether this is related to a commercial product distributed in the region\nvs. a common source event which this article seems to rule out. - MPP\n...........................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

This compares\nwith nine cases throughout 1998 and nine in 1997. Some of the infections\nhave been serious: at least seven patients have been admitted to hospital\nand in four cases the organism has been isolated from blood. Most of the\ncases identified so far are from London and one case lives in Luton, which\nis some 30 miles north of London. Another case, who lives in Leicester (a\ncity in the Midlands), may have acquired the infection in London. Twelve of\nthe cases have Asian names, and some are known to be vegetarian. None had\nrecently travelled abroad. Six of the patients are adults, three are\nteenagers, and four are children aged between 5 months and 4 years.\nThe infecting strain is susceptible to antimicrobial agents, including\nampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin. _S. java_ is\na group B salmonella and has the same antigenic structure as S. paratyphi B\n(O = 4, 12: H = b : 1.2). _S. java_ and _S. paratyphi_ B are differentiated\nby the dextro-tartrate test, in which _S. java_ produces a positive acid\nreaction, whereas _S. paratyphi_ B is negative. The fact that several\npatients developed bacteraemia suggests that the organisms are behaving\nmore like _S. paratyphi_ B, which routinely causes enteric fever, rather\nthan _S. java_, which is more commonly associated with gastroenteritis.\nThe PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) is investigating\nthe contact details of the individual cases and asking them about food\nexposures. An enquiry is being made to Enter-net (the international\nsurveillance network for enteric pathogens), which will ask whether cases\nare also occurring in other countries and whether any foodstuffs have been\nidentified recently that may help in the investigation of this outbreak.\nReported by Sergio Brusin (sbrusin@phls.nhs.uk), PHLS Communicable Disease\nSurveillance Centre, Georgia Duckworth (g.duckworth@cdsc.nthames.nhs.uk),\nPHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Thames, Linda Ward\n(lward@phls.co.uk) PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, England,\nand Ian Fisher (ifisher@phls.co.uk) Enter-net scientific coordinator.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n......................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The Food and\nDrug Administration said it would ban 1998 exports until farms adopted a\nseries of precautions, such as filtering water used for irrigation and\npesticide spraying.\nThe story adds that Canada, which has continued to import berries from\nGuatemala, last month reported more than 200 additional illnesses that may\nbe connected to the raspberries (305 last I heard; doubt they will have\nsimilar public hearings in Canada -- dp)\nDr. Stephen Ostroff, an investigator with the CDC was qutoed as saying,\n\"The preliminary data suggests that these are once again linked to\nGuatemalan raspberries.\"\nCDC investigators are, the story says, working with the Canadian government\nto try to crack the latest cases there. But no laboratory methods yet exist\nto detect cyclospora on berries or in water, according to the CDC.\nSenator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who heads a Senate subcommittee\nthat has been investigating the safety of imported food, was cited as\nsaying that most of the raspberry-linked illnesses occurred during\nGuatemala's spring rainy season. Guatemalans are accustomed to diarrhoeal\nproblems in the spring, referring to it as \"mal de mayo,\" or the May\ndisease, adding that \"The subcommittee's purpose is not to indict one\ncountry or region of the world but to focus on a case study of tainted\nimported fruit -- from the farm in a foreign country to the tables of\nAmerica -- in order to understand how we can better protect American\nconsumers.\"\n[By Julie Vorman\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n......................................es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

They advised people that as soon as they come across a\nperson having the above-mentioned symptoms, they must take him or her to a\nnearby hospital or clinic because excessive vomiting and diarrhoea lead to\ndehydration.\nConfirming that the cases of gastroenteritis which had shot up during May\nhave not yet subsided, doctors said as the cases of gastroenteritis would\ncontinue to increase till August, people must drink a sufficient quantity\nof boiled water, besides avoiding stale food and fruits.

The\nsuggestion is based on the combination of encephalopathy with aspirin\nintake reported for the cases and their association reported in the\nliterature.\nAspirin intake is, however, not a rare event; I guess that 90% of cases of\nencephalopathy of any cause in DR Congo would have had aspirin in their\npast few days history. Therefore, Reye's syndrome is not more likely than\nany other cause of encephalopathy. In addition, should aspirin not have\nbeen taken, Reye's syndrome would still remain one of the options.\nIt is interesting to see that physicians only suggest one not very likely\ndiagnosis, while a computer aid (like GIDEON in previous mail) reminds us\nthat the presentation of the patients is non-specific and suggests many\nmore alternative diagnoses: hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg,\nCrimean-Congo), yellow fever, bacterial septicemia, malaria, anthrax and\nshigellosis.\n--\nJerome Sclafer\nMember of the editorial team\nLa revue Prescrire\nBP 459 - 75527 France Cedex 11\ntel: +33 1 4700 9445\nfax: +33 1 4807 8732\ne-mail: jeromjet@easynet.fr\n[Bill, do you have sera or other specimens, and can you get them out to CDC\nor Jo'burg for testing? - Mod.JW\n......................................jw/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The\nposting below is the complete version. - Mod.CHC\nThis report comes from Vanga Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n(former Zaire) where two cases of encephalopathy of undetermined etiology\npresented this week at this 400 bed mission hospital located in the\ninterior of the Republic of Congo 80 kilometers upriver from Kikwit.\nTwo school age children from different villages in the Vanga Health\nDistrict (5-7 kilometers apart) presented to the reference hospital with\nsymptoms consistent with a viral gastroenteritis. Both evolved rapidly\ninto a coma. The first child died within 48 hours, the second is at present\nstill comatose. The children attended different schools and secured water\nand food from different sources. No family members to date have contracted\nthis illness.\nThe cases are as follows:\nPatient 1 (hospitalized 12/18/97)\nThe first patient, an eight year old boy from the village Songo, 6 km from\nVanga fell ill on a Friday after school and died 2 days later on Sunday\nevening. The child in otherwise good health had been seen at Vanga\nHospital five days earlier for a sprained ankle sustained while playing\nsoccer. He was given aspirin and an ace bandage. On the first day of his\nillness he experienced colicky abdominal pain with persistent vomiting. He\nwas treated locally with chloramphenicol and an anti-spasmodic\n(papaverine). The following day he was referred to the Vanga Hospital\nwhere clinical exam by a physician suggested viral gastroenteritis in an\notherwise healthy child. He was afebrile, a malaria smear was negative and\nwhite blood count was 12,150mm3. The child was hospitalized for\nobservation. Chloramphenicol and an antispasmodic were continued.\nEarly the following morning the night nurse found the boy in a deep coma\nand signaled the physician on call. The child was febrile (38 C) with\ntachycardia (120) and tachypnea (48). He was unresponsive to all stimuli.\nPupils were dilated and responsive to light. Diffuse hypotonia and\nhyporeflexia were noted. Babinski test was negative. Lungs were clear and\nheart sounds normal. The liver edge was smooth and palpated 3cm below the\ncostal margin; spleen was not enlarged. No icterus was noted. Urine was\nnegative for bilirubin. A spinal tap revealed 2 white cells and 408 red\ncells, no trypanosomes were found on a centrifuged specimen. Malaria smear\nagain was negative. A blood sugar was 97. An anticholinesterase agent\n(neostigmine) was given without effect. The child was started empirically\non intravenous quinine and dextrose. He remained in a coma and died later\nthat day.\nPatient 2 (hospitalized 12/26/97)\nThe second child, a six-year-old girl from the village of Bilili, 11 km\nfrom Vanga developed a low grade fever, abdominal pain and vomiting 5 days\nprior to her presentation to this hospital. She was treated at a local\nclinic with Bactrim and aspirin and referred to the Vanga hospital when her\nsymptoms persisted. She walked into the outpatient clinic at Vanga on a\nSaturday afternoon and the following day, today is in a coma.\nThe child was evaluated by a physician upon entry and felt to have mild\ngastroenteritis but otherwise in good health. She was afebrile and had\nsubtle rales in her right lung base, though no cough or dyspnea were noted.\nHer malaria smear was negative, white count 6,800 mm3 and stool sample was\nnegative for leukocytes and parasites. She too was hospitalized under\nobservation and started on oral rehydration fluids and ampicillin.\nDuring the evening she had persistent vomiting and became combative.\nClinical exam by the same physician in the morning revealed her to be in a\ncoma, minimally responsive to noxious stimuli. She was afebrile with heart\nrate 90 and respiratory rate 30. Pupils were again dilated and responsive\nto light. She had diffuse hypertonia though a negative Babinski. No\nseizure activity was noted. Rales were now noted along both bases and an\nS3 gallop was appreciated. Liver and spleen were mildly enlarged. A spinal\ntap was negative with 1 white cell, 3 reds and no evidence of trypanosomes.\nRepeat malaria was negative. White count was now 15,900 with 85% polys\nand 15% lymphocytes (no eosinophils noted). Sedimentation rate was 103mm\n(elevated for our lab). The child was given furosemide with resolution of\nher rales and diminution of tachypnea. Quinine and dextrose were given\nI.V. Later in the day the child became diffusely hypotonic and\nunresponsive to all stimuli . As of this report, the child is still\ncomatose.\nPublic Health teams will travel tomorrow to these villages to interview\nfamily members and school mates. Similar cases (if any), treated in the\nlocal dispensary will be identified.\nBlood has been obtained from the second child and the serum separated and\nfrozen. These are available to an interested collaborator, although\narrangements need to be made with the State Department and then the U.S.\nEmbassy in Kinshasa for exportation. The samples can be sent frozen by\nMissionary Aviation Flights from Vanga to Kinshasa.\nWe will advise ProMED-mail of future cases. We welcome comments from\nProMED-mail subscribers and similar experiences by physicians as we try and\nidentify the etiology of this apparent rapid onset encephalopathy in two\nschool age children in our health district in the DRC, Central Africa.\n--\nDr Jacques Katele\nChief, Vanga Health Zone\nand\nDr William Clemmer\nStaff Physician, Vanga Hospital\nEvangelical Hospital\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\ne-mail: CLEMMER@MAF.Org\n......................................chc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

One suggests a real world cause, one\nsuggests sorcery. As attempted sorcery is no less real than attempted\ndiagnosis, the reports are combined. - Mod.CHC]\n[1]\n[Digested] report by Dr Stephen Flew, Senior Medical Office, Ok Tedi Mining\nLtd, (written for Papua New Guinea Department of Health); Re: Outbreak of\nunknown disease /excess deaths, Sandaun Province\n[Investigation] indicated the [people] at Tapsie village were mostly\naffected by the usual skin afflictions common to the area such as grille\n(tinea imbicata), tropical ulcers, yaws, etc. as well as malaria,\nfilariasis, tropical splenomegaly and pneumonia. However there did not\nappear to be any excess of morbidity or mortality at this time, nor during\nthe drought. [The investigators] were told that the most affected areas were\nUrapmin and Ibikmen but that people had fled their usual dwellings due to\nfear of sorcery and were living in bush houses. They were strongly advised\nnot to go to these areas on foot by the people at Yapsie, because of the\ndangers of sorcery. The team were willing to go into Urapmin by chopper so\nwe flew them [there], accompanied by a local guide. The main village of\nUrapmin appeared deserted so we proceeded up the Aki river to an isolated\nhamlet and managed to land the chopper on a tiny beach in a nearby creek.\nThere seemed to be about 20-30 people living here, many covered in \"grille\"\nand with swollen bellies but seemed to be saying they were all OK, as far as\nI could make out above the noise of the chopper. The terrain here is very\nbroken and mountainous and I believe these people must be in a chronic state\nof poor health, with no ready access to any form of health care. There did\nnot appear to have been any deaths there but we left a team behind to\ninvestigate further.\nThe other team (from the Health Dept. in Vanimo) had gone to Ibikmin\nvillage. When we arrived they had already left; apparently there were no\nproblems there either.\nWe proceeded to another isolated hamlet on a heavily forested ridge, known\nas Finyaksolmin. The second team had only just arrived the night before and\nhad had no chance to check the local population yet. They were told there\nhad been no deaths here but 2 people had died at nearby Firayabamin, one\nolder woman of COAD [?] and a young man of malaria (?).\nBack at Yapsie [the health worker] who had been left in charge for the last\nfew months reported that health-wise things [were bad but] hadn't really got\nany worse during the drought, with a high prevalence of childhood\nmalnutrition (30-50%) and many patients with chronic anaemia and\nhepatosplenomegaly (secondary to filariasis and malaria). There is a high\nproportion of refugees now residing amongst the locals at Yapsie who have\n[come] from over the border with Irian Jaya (just 10 kms away). The\npresence of the refugees in an already marginally productive environment\nexacerbates the malnutrition problem, and malnutrition is accepted as the\nnorm for growing children. No doubt the maternal, infant and childhood\nmortality rates must be amongst the highest in PNG, even under normal\nclimatological conditions. Even in October Yapsie appeared fairly green and\nnot much affected by drought. Now the Sepik river is in flood and there is\nlittle evidence of drought except for the extensive bushfires in the high\ncountry between here and Tabubil.\nA review of the Health Centre monthly reports at Yapsie indicates there was\nnot much change in outpatient illness rates for the common conditions of\ncough, pneumonia, other respiratory disease, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia,\nyaws and other skin diseases during October-November (total of 1200\nattendances each month). During the first 3 weeks of December there appears\nto have been an increase in malaria, 'flu, diarrhoea and skin diseases (the\nlatter esp. from Munbil, ?some ulcers requiring skin grafts). However there\nhas been no increase in deaths recorded at Yapsie and the [administrator]\nfrom Fiak was also surprised to hear of the 10 deaths which were reported\nfrom his area, none of which he was aware of.\nIt would appear that the lay reporting of 19 deaths and 24-30 people\ncritically ill or comatose in the Yapsie and Fiak subdistricts of Telefomin\nhas been grossly exaggerated. The reporting of these deaths may have come\nabout due to the rumours of sorcery and the confusion arising from the\nabandonment of villages in the area. [He goes on to suggest that additional\nresources be made available to these isolated communities so that the\nincidence of filariasis, malaria, and other vector-borne diseases could be\nreduced.]\n\nDr. Stephen Flew, SMO\nOk Tedi Mining Ltd\nFlew.Stephen.S@bhp.com.au\n--\nDr J A Ballard, Visiting Fellow\nGraduate School, Australian National University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia\nTel +61 2 6249 5487 Fax +61 2 6249 4829\nGraduate School web page http://online.anu.edu.au/academia/graduate/\ne-mail: john.ballard@anu.edu.au\n\n[2]\nDate: Wed, 24 Dec 1997 17:11:46 +0700 (JAVT)\nFrom: zulfian <ZULFIAN@JAYAPURA.WASANTARA.NET.ID>\nWe thank you for the attention and consideration on what happen in Irian\nJaya, especially in the highland of Jayawijaya.\nThe El Nino has affected the area to cause the drought since April 1997. It\nseems that the situation has incerased the temperature in the highland. Our\nconsideration is in the area above 1,700 m (5,000 feet) from sea level,\nwhich [has seen] several changes on the ecosystem.\nWe have clinically and laboratory confirmed that cerebral malaria has been\nfound in that area (Lolat, Weawen, and Kabianggema, these three villages are\nnot in the border of Papua New Guinea). Malaria are common in Irian Jaya;\nhowever, it was amazing because the disease had never been found [at that\naltitude]. A recent investigation by a team of entomologists,\nepidemiologists, and clinical laboratorians found that the _Anopheles\npunctulatus_ [?] has climbed up to higher altitude.\nBlood smear examination from 52 [people in the?] high prevalence area had\nalso confirmed that plasmodium infections were responsible for the\nmysterious disease. The parasite rate had been found 31.9% - 98.21% among\nthe suffering patients.\nThese villages listed below are endemic [for] malaria and are on the border\nof Papua New Guinea :\n\nVillage Parasite rate\nPepera 98.21%\nBulangkop 81.71%\nMimin 54.17%\nKabiding 31.90%\nOknagul 70.00%\nCurrently, the rate has decreased to 2% after a radical mass treatment with\nchloroquine.\nAn investigation is being conducted at village Okyop (a village close to\nYapsie of Papua New Guinea), since it was reported that same problem arise\nthere. We hope that the laboratory result (blood smear) can be confirmed\nwithin a week.\n--\nZulfian Muslim, MD\nHead, District Health Office\nDistrict of Jayawijaya\nIrian Jaya, Indonesia\n[So, we have a situation in which many serious infectious diseases are\nendemic and the current hypotheses are (1) there is no excess morbidity or\nmortality but (2) primitive beliefs are driving rumors of such illnesses and\ndeaths and (3) there is cerebral malaria in the area but that it is being\ntreated properly and successfully. We likely will not get to a diagnostic\nresolution of this situation. - Mod.CHC]\n...............................chc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

I would suspect underlying virus infection\nespecially if a consistent bacterial pathogen is not isolated from multiple\nsnakes. Histopathologic lesions are not always pathognomonic for\nparamyxovirus infection in snakes but a pathologist familiar with snake\nhistopathology should recognize suspicious lesions. Evaluation of organs\nother than the lung can be especially revealing (pancreas, liver). In some\ncases, pancreatic changes are more specific for this viral disease than\npulmonary changes. Isolation of this virus can be difficult and is best\nattempted by those labs with reptile virology experience.\nTwo that we have worked with successfully are the University of Florida,\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine (Dr. Elliott Jacobson) and the University of\nTennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine (Dr. Melissa Kennedy).\n--\nRebecca Papendick, DVM\nAssociate Pathologist\nZoological Society of San Diego\nSan Diego, CA, USA\ne-mail: rpapendick@sandiegozoo.org\n\n[2\nDate: Tue, 2 Dec 1997 11:07:10 -0600\nFrom: Rene Alvarez <ralvarez@icarus.sfbr.org>\n\nAn e-mail was sent to me concerning the recent outbreak of pneumonia which\nhas been causing a high morbidity and mortality in snakes at the Dallas\nZoo.

I believe we should consider\nencephalitis caused by tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus. Of course, the\ntypical habitat for chamois does not correspond to that of Ixodes ricinus,\nthe main vector of TBE. Moreover, TBE infection has not been associated\nwith symptoms in wild ungulates.\nCertain populations of chamois, however, occur in typical I. ricinus\nhabitats, mainly due to disturbance by human \"outdoor activities\" (hiking,\nhang-gliding etc.). Such animals appear to be more heavily infested by I.\nricinus ticks, than are roe deer, taken nearby.\nMy own studies take me to a sub-alpine site in eastern Switzerland where\nTBE transmission is frequent, and where chamois appear to be the main local\nhost for adult I. ricinus, rather than roe deer. Chamois avoid human\ncontact more than do roe deer. Chamois-dependent tick populations\ntherefore may tend not to come in contact with people, which could explain\nwhy people acquire TBE infection so sporadically in such areas.\nAlthough chamois have never been implicated as reservoir hosts for TBE\nvirus, and the involvement of ibex suggests an altitude not suitable for\nticks, the reference to a neurological disease of ungulates \"in a remote\narea\" might suggest this agent.\n[Thanks very much for the response. I am a little surprised we didn't get\nmore comments because the request was cross posted on Epivet-L, a listserve\nfor veterinary epidemiologists. FYI, Chamois is _Rupicapra rupicapra_, a\nsmall goatlike antelope found in the high mountainous areas of Europe and\nthe Caucasus. Chamois was at one time used to some extent in bookbinding,\nbut is now most famous for being a soft, pliable leather cloth made from\nthe skin of the chamois. Ibex is similar ruminant found in Europe and\nelsewhere. - Mod. pc\n--\nIvo Foppa,\nDepts. of Epidemiology and Immunology & Infectious Diseases\nHarvard School of Public Health, Boston\n.....................................pc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Since September 15, hunters\nobserved at least seven animals suffering from a progressive palsy\naffecting first the posterior limbs and leading to death in about a week.\nAutopsies performed until now failed to reveal any etiology but a viral\nencephalitis is suspected by veterinarians who are still working on this\nproblem.\nThe question has been asked of a possible transmission to humans (it is the\nhunting season) or domestic animals (cattle might be in contact with\naffected wild animals).
