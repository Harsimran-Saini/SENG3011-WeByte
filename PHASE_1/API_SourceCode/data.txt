The aim of\nthis study was to evaluate the clinical findings, therapy, and\noutcome in children with cutaneous anthrax (CA). Data on age, gender,\noccupation, clinical symptoms and findings, location and type of\nlesions, clinical history, laboratory findings, treatment, and\noutcome were recorded from patients' medical records, retrospectively.\n\nThe study included 65 patients between 1 month and 18 years old (9.0\nplus or minus 4.0 years), 37 patients (56.9 percent) were male and 28\n(43.1 percent) were female. Most of the patients (89.1 percent) were\nadmitted in summer and autumn (p < 0.001). Of the 65 patients, 20\npatients (30.8 percent) had received antibiotherapy before admission\nto our hospital. All patients except one had a contact history with\ninfected animals. A 1-month-old patient had a contact history with\nhis mother who had CA.\n\nOn clinical examination, anthrax edema was noted in 36 (55.3 percent)\npatients, anthrax pustule in 27 (41.5 percent), and anthrax edema and\nanthrax pustule in 2 (3 percent) patients. Gram staining and culture\nwas positive for B. anthracis in 35 (53.8 percent) patients, and only\nGram staining was positive in 10 (15.4 percent) patients. In the\nremaining 20 (30.8 percent) patients, the diagnosis was made by\nclinical findings. Because the anthrax outbreak in Turkey was\nassociated with slaughtering or milking of ill cows, sheep, or goats,\nand handling raw meat without taking any protective measures, persons\nin the community must be educated about using personal protective\nequipment during slaughtering of animals and handling of meat and\nskins.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Human anthrax is a serious zoonotic problem in Turkey. They\npresently average some 300 to 150 human cases each year (the\nincidence is slowing), with significant numbers of originating\noutbreaks in cattle, and small ruminants, and the occasional equine\ncase. This is an informative cross-section of what can be expected\nand the problems of diagnosis. Contagious cases are rare -- see the\ninfant infected by its mother -- but they can happen.
