COLI EHEC - AUSTRIA: O146, UNKNOWN SOURCE\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 26 Feb 2021\nSource: Food Safety News [edited]\nhttps://www.foodsafetynews.com/2021/02/investigators-still-looking-for-source-of-outbreak-of-e-coli-infections-in-austria/\n\n\nAustrian authorities are investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)] infections that has affected a handful of people. Between September and December 2020, 6 people fell ill with infections from _E. coli_ O146:H28. Those sick live in 5 federal states. Two people needed hospital treatment. As yet, there is no indication as to the source of the outbreak, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). It is understood other countries in Europe have not reported related infections.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) has instructed AGES to investigate the outbreak with the relevant state authorities. Austrian food testing in 2018 found _E. coli_ O146 in 3 samples of fresh game meat and one sample of fermented sausage. In 2017, 4 isolates were typed as _E. coli_ O146 from 2 samples of raw meat from wild ruminants, fresh bovine meat and a fermented sausage.\n\nThe latest Zoonoses Report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows _E. coli_ O146 was the 5th most frequent serogroup reported in confirmed human infections in 2018.\n\nAnyone who has developed symptoms of EHEC infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Most patients recover within 5 to 7 days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAbout 5% to 10% of those diagnosed with EHEC infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.\n\nMany people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than 5 years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Shiga toxin-producing O146 is one of the non-O157 serotypes causing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ disease. The source of this zoonotic infection in Austria is not clear at this point. Potential vehicles for transmission include salads, unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked ground beef. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nAustria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/109]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nE. coli EHEC - Germany: (MV) O26, day care centers, RFI 20201204.7992377\nE. coli EHEC - Norway: hemolytic uremic syndrome, fatal 20200730.7625577\n2019\n----\nE. coli EHEC - Norway: hemolytic uremic syndrome, unusual strain, RFI 20190909.6665443\nE. coli EHEC - Denmark: hemolytic uremic syndrome, fatal 20190905.6659381\nE. coli EHEC - Iceland (03): O26, ice cream susp 20190717.6571885\nE. coli EHEC - Iceland (02) 20190715.6569675\nE. coli EHEC - Iceland: 20190705.6553835\nE. coli EHEC - France: O26, unpasteurized cheese 20190429.6448172\n2018\n----\nE. coli EHEC - France (03): O26, unpasteurized cheese, more cases 20181221.6219141\nE. coli EHEC - Europe: O80:H2, hybrid invasive pathogen, antimicrobial resistance 20181109.6134613\nE. coli EHEC - Sweden: RFI 20180816.5968531\nE. coli EHEC - Norway: O157, RFI 20180719.5915567\nE. coli EHEC - Ireland (02): increased numbers 20180704.5888313\nE. coli EHEC - France (02): O26, unpasteurized cheese, more cases 20180604.5837791\nE. coli EHEC - Ireland: (Ulster) childcare center 20180527.5820927\nE. coli EHEC - France: O26, unpasteurized cheese, alert, recall 20180511.5792857\nE. coli EHEC - Canada: cheese, 2013, 60 day rule 20180220.5639238\nE. coli EHEC - Denmark: O26 20181106.6129035\nE. coli EHEC - UK (02): (England) O157, raw pet food, fatal, 2017 20181019.6100174\nE. coli EHEC - UK: (England) fatal 20181005.6071314\nE. coli EHEC - Ireland (03): (GY) daycare 20180722.5915568\n.................................................ll/rd/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-03-14 00:00:00", "2017-03-14 00:00:00", "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "2020-03-14 00:00:00", "2019-03-14 00:00:00", "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2013-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Austria", "country": "Austria"}, {"location": "England", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}]}]}], "other": [{"url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8202225", "archive_id": "8202225", "date": "2021-02-19 21:31:57", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (BR)", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (01): (BIHAR)\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 19 Feb 2021\nSource: BusinessWorld [edited]\nhttp://www.businessworld.in/article/One-Encephalitis-case-detected-in-Bihar-s-Muzaffarpur-/19-02-2021-379392/\n\n\nA child in Bihar's Muzaffarpur has been detected with symptoms of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Shrikrishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCK), and paediatrics department has confirmed the case on Friday [19 Feb 2021].\n\n\"Paediatrics department yesterday [Thu 18 Feb 2021] confirmed one case of AES in Muzaffarpur's SKMC Hospital,\" hospital superintendent Dr BS Jha said. \"We are prepared to deal with this case; we have arranged the medicines. There will be a review meeting on 24 Feb [2021] with concerned officials regarding the case.\"\n\nIn October 2020, a total of 77 children were admitted to SKMCH hospital with AES/Japanese encephalitis.\n\nAES is a viral disease that causes flu-like symptoms such as high fever, vomiting, and, in extreme cases, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although there are fewer cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Bihar state this year [2021] than in previous years, these cases continue to occur in that state. From 27 Mar 2020 until 1 Nov 2020, 89 children suffering from AES/JE were admitted to Muzaffarpur's Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital in Bihar.\n\nThe above and previous reports do not indicate how many of the AES cases are due to Japanese encephalitis. As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Dr. T. Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran, and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar. These 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nThe report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of cases will not be possible. The season in which AES and JE cases occur is underway, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 2-3 months. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nMuzaffarpur, Bihar, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/58423]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (BR) 20201114.7942386\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (BR) 20200813.7676074\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20200511.7321107\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20200428.7278100\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20200419.7238745\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (BR) 20200331.7163711\n.................................................sb/jh/ty/tw/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "dengue", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-02-19 00:00:00", "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "2020-10-14 00:00:00", "2020-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2020-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Vaishali", "country": "India"}, {"location": "East Champaran", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Bihar", "country": "Hungary"}, {"location": "Muzaffarpur", "country": "India"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}]}]}]}
