To date [9 Mar 2021], Viet Nam [sic. Presumably should say LSD. - Mod.SH] had hit 163 communes in 65 districts of 18 cities and provinces in Viet Nam, affecting 2200 cows and buffaloes with 300 culled.\n\nBy 1 Mar 2021, the disease had attacked roughly 1000 cows and buffaloes in many districts of the Ha Tinh province [North Central Coast region] and has tended to rise. The province is seeking the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development for the import of 5000 doses of vaccine for the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, the disease has also appeared in the Nghi Loc Commune, situated in neighboring Nghe An [Vietnam's largest province by area, similarly in the North Central Coast region]. Initially, 6 cows of 4 households were diagnosed with the disease.\n\nLumpy skin disease virus is a double-stranded DNA virus. It is a member of the capripoxvirus genus of Poxviridae and is not infectious to humans. It is believed that arthropod vectors, direct contact, contaminated feed and water and iatrogenic means (for example, repeated use of needles on different animals) can all spread the disease.\n\nThe incubation period is between 4 and 14 days postinfection. The infection rate among cows and buffaloes is around 10%-20% with 1%-5% [case fatalities].\n\nUnder the ministry's instructions, all animals tested positive for the disease have to be culled. Meanwhile, all cattle which have not yet been hit by the disease need to be quarantined to ensure safety.\n\nAreas which have been affected by the disease have to set up stations for the cattle transport control.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Viet Nam's immediate notification of LSD, reporting the first 4 outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 1 Nov 2020 ( 20201103.7911552).

If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals.\n\n\"As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals.

Acute allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. JAMA. 2021 Mar 8. doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.3976. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33683290; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777417].\n\nScientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital administered email, text, phone, and smartphone app survey links to 64 900 employees who received a dose of one of the 2 mRNA coronavirus vaccines from 16 Dec 2020-12 Feb 2021.\n\nmRNA vaccines \"teach\" human cells to make a harmless part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to trigger an immune response to the virus. The authors noted that people with a history of life-threatening reactions, or anaphylaxis, to allergens such as those in a vaccine are often hesitant to receive vaccines, which may complicate efforts to end the pandemic.\n\nA total of 25 929 employees (40%) received the Pfizer vaccine, while 38 971 (60%) received the Moderna vaccine. 81% returned at least one symptom survey, which were sent each day for 3 days after vaccination. Among all vaccinated employees, 1365 (2.10%) reported acute allergic reactions, defined on the survey as itching, rash, hives, swelling, and/or respiratory symptoms. More Moderna vaccinees (2.20%) reported symptoms than Pfizer vaccinees (1.95%).\n\nPrevious anaphylactic episodes\n------------------------------\nA review of medical records identified anaphylaxis in 16 workers (0.025%) (9 [0.023%] with the Moderna vaccine and 7 [0.027%] with the Pfizer vaccine). Mean age of vaccinees diagnosed as having anaphylaxis was 41 years, 94% were women, 63% had a history of allergy, and 31% had previously had anaphylaxis.\n\nMean time from vaccination to anaphylaxis onset was 17 minutes. One patient required intensive care, 56% received intramuscular epinephrine (to facilitate breathing), and all recovered without experiencing shock or requiring endotracheal intubation. 3 workers with a history of anaphylaxis didn't seek medical care. The mechanism of the anaphylaxis occurrences in the study is unknown.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously reported an incidence of anaphylaxis of 2.5 to 11.1 per million doses, most of them in people with a history of allergy, the authors noted. \"The incidence rate of confirmed anaphylaxis in this study is larger than that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on passive spontaneous reporting methods,\" they wrote. \"However, the overall risk of anaphylaxis to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine remains extremely low and largely comparable to other common health care exposures.\"\n\nWhile most vaccinees with anaphylaxis had a history of allergy, the researchers noted that because about 5% of US adults have severe food allergies, and 1% have severe drug allergies, the employee group studied must have included nearly 4000 workers with histories of anaphylaxis who were vaccinated without related adverse events. \"In this prospective cohort of health care employees, 98% did not have any symptoms of an allergic reaction after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the authors wrote.\n\n[byline: Mary Van Beusekom]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n******\n[2] Risk differences between males and females\n[A] Gender differences 1: vaccine\nDate: Mon 8 Mar 2021\nSource: The New York Times [abridged, edited]\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2pry2rzx\n\n\nWomen report worse side effects after a COVID-19 vaccine\n--------------------------------------------------------\nMen and women tend to respond differently to many kinds of vaccines. That's probably because of a mix of factors, including hormones, genes, and the dosing of the shots.\n\nOn the morning that [SK] received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, she felt fine. By afternoon, she noticed a sore arm and body aches, and by evening, it felt like the flu. \"My teeth were chattering, but I was sweating -- like soaked, but frozen,\" said [SK], 44, a medical technician in State College, PA [Pennsylvania]. The next day, she went to work and surveyed her colleagues -- 8 men and 7 women -- about their vaccine experiences. 6 of the women had body aches, chills, and fatigue. The one woman who didn't have flu symptoms was up much of the night vomiting.\n\nThe 8 men gave drastically different reports. One had mild arm pain, a headache, and body aches. 2 described mild fatigue and a bit of achiness. One got a headache. And 4 had no symptoms at all. \"I work with some very tough women,\" [SK] said. But \"clearly, us women suffered a severity of the side effects.\" She felt better after 24 hours, and is thrilled she got the vaccine. \"I wouldn't change a thing, because it sure beats the alternative,\" she said. \"But I also didn't know what to expect.\"\n\nThe differences [SK] observed among her co-workers are playing out across the country. In a study published last month [February 2021], researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed safety data from the 1st 13.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses given to Americans. Among the side effects reported to the agency, 79.1 per cent came from women, even though only 61.2 per cent of the vaccines had been administered to women.\n\nNearly all of the rare anaphylactic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have occurred among women, too. CDC researchers reported that all 19 of the individuals who had experienced such a reaction to the Moderna vaccine have been female, and that women made up 44 of the 47 who have had anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\"I am not at all surprised,\" said Sabra Klein, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"This sex difference is completely consistent with past reports of other vaccines.\" In a 2013 study, scientists with CDC and other institutions found that 4 times as many women as men between the ages of 20 and 59 reported allergic reactions after receiving the 2009 pandemic flu vaccine, even though more men than women got those shots. Another study found that between 1990 and 2016, women accounted for 80 per cent of all adult anaphylactic reactions to vaccines.\n\nIn general, women \"have more reactions to a variety of vaccines,\" said Julianne Gee, a medical officer in CDC's Immunization Safety Office. That includes influenza vaccines given to adults, as well as some given in infancy, such as the hepatitis B and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines. The news isn't all bad for women, though. Side effects are usually mild and short-lived. And these physical reactions are a sign that a vaccine is working -- that \"you are mounting a very robust immune response, and you will likely be protected as a result\", Dr Klein said.\n\nBut why do these sex differences happen? Part of the answer could be behavioral. It's possible that women are more likely than men to report side effects even when their symptoms are the same, said Rosemary Morgan, an international health researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. There's no vaccine-specific research to support this claim, but men are less likely than women to see doctors when they are sick, so they may also be less likely to report side effects, she said.\n\nStill, there's no question that biology plays an important role. \"The female immune response is distinct, in many ways, from the male immune response,\" said Eleanor Fish. Research has shown that, compared with their male counterparts, women and girls produce more -- sometimes twice as many -- infection-fighting antibodies in response to the vaccines for influenza, MMR, yellow fever, rabies, and hepatitis A and B. They often mount stronger responses from immune fighters called T cells, too, Ms Gee noted. These differences are often most robust among younger adults, which \"suggests a biological effect, possibly associated with reproductive hormones\", she said.\n\nSex hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone can bind to the surface of immune cells and influence how they work. Exposure to estrogen causes immune cells to produce more antibodies in response to the flu vaccine, for example. And testosterone, Dr Klein said, \"is kind of beautifully immunosuppressive\". The flu vaccine tends to be less protective in men with lots of testosterone compared with men with less of the sex hormone. Among other things, testosterone suppresses the body's production of immune chemicals known as cytokines.\n\nGenetic differences between men and women may also influence immunity. Many immune-related genes are on the X chromosome, of which women have 2 copies and men have only one. Historically, immunologists believed that only one X chromosome in women was turned on, and that the other was inactivated. But research now shows that 15 per cent of genes escape this inactivation and are more highly expressed in women.\n\nThese robust immune responses help to explain why 80 per cent of autoimmune diseases afflict women. \"Women have greater immunity, whether it's to ourselves, whether it's to a vaccine antigen, whether it's to a virus,\" Dr Klein said.\n\nThe size of a vaccine dose may also be important. Studies have shown that women absorb and metabolize drugs differently than men do, often needing lower doses for the same effect. But until the 1990s, drug and vaccine clinical trials largely excluded women. \"The drug dosages that are recommended are historically based on clinical trials that involve male participants,\" Dr Morgan said.\n\nClinical trials today do include women. But in the trials for the new COVID-19 vaccines, side effects were not sufficiently separated and analyzed by sex, Dr Klein said. And they did not test whether lower doses might be just as effective for women but cause fewer side effects. Until they do, Dr Klein said, healthcare providers should talk to women about vaccine side effects so they are not scared by them. \"I think that there is value to preparing women that they may experience more adverse reactions,\" she said. \"That is normal, and likely reflective of their immune system working.\"\n\n[byline: Melinda Wenner Moyer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nClaudinne Miller\nTulane Outbreak Daily\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\n\n----\n[B] Japan: vaccination anaphylaxis and females\nDate: Tue 9 Mar 2021 07:46 JST\nSource: Yomiuri [in Japanese, machine trans., edited]\nhttps://www.yomiuri.co.jp/medical/20210309-OYT1T50288/\n\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced on [9 Mar 2021] that 9 medical workers vaccinated against the new coronavirus were reported as [having] anaphylaxis with severe allergic symptoms.

While both males and females experience similar types of adverse reactions, the proportion of female vaccinees reporting local reactions, such as injection site pain, redness, and swelling, as well as systemic reactions, including joint or muscle pain, headache, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, and hypersensitivity reactions is consistently greater than for males (Table 1). Whether differences in adverse reactions among aged males and females reflect a gender-based reporting bias or a sex difference in inflammation has not been resolved. Data on adverse reactions to vaccines are typically collected through the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which relies on passive reporting of adverse reactions. Thus females may be more likely to report adverse reactions to VAERS than males. Limited analyses of local erythema and induration, which are measures of inflammation, at the site of seasonal influenza vaccination illustrate that aged females have significantly larger (6 mm or more) injection site reactions to the vaccine than their male counterparts. Future studies must continue to develop methods for accurate assessment of the qualitative as well as the quantitative reactions to vaccines to better understand whether differences in adverse reactions to vaccines reflect a sex, gender, or both form of biases.\n\n\"The biological differences [between males and females], spanning hormones and genes to the microbiome and past exposures to infections, may differentially influence immune responses to vaccines in males and females. As a result of the biological differences between males and females, \"precision vaccines\" should be developed that consider how sex influences the outcome of vaccination.\"\n(Excerpted from Fink AL, Klein SL.

In data presented at virtual sessions of the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) 2021 this week, a team of Johns Hopkins University investigators reported discernable differences in severe COVID-19 among men and women, and at varied ages. The findings could indicate the means by which clinicians may be able to monitor suspected SARS-CoV-2 and an individual's risk to severe disease progression.\n\nAs Eileen P Scully said in her presentation, early pandemic data suggested a bias in male mortality risk. Up until February 2021, males have comprised less than half (49%) of all SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, but have comprised 57% of all deaths, based on data from 132 countries. Whether this is due fully or partially to factors including sex-differentiated care-seeking tendencies, health status, illness presentation, comorbidities, or treatment responses is still not understood at 12 months of the pandemic. \"The mechanisms for this effect have not yet been defined, and may potentially offer therapeutic targets for intervention,\" Scully said.\n\nScully and colleagues assessed data from the Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) 5 hospital system for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and admission rates from March-October 2020. They used the JHM COVID-19 registry, JH-CROWN, to extract detailed patient-level data, which was analyzed for male-female differences through descriptive statistics. From the observed 213 175 tests, 57% were conducted in females; they reported a similar SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate (8.2%) as males (8.9%). However, males were more likely to become hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 confirmation (33% vs 28%).\n\nAmong the 2608 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, more males reported fever; females more frequently reported headaches, loss of smell, and vomiting (P < 0.05). Regarding respiratory metrics, females had more favorable profiles on average, with lower respiratory rates and greater SpO2:FiO2 ratios than men (P < 0.001). Females reported lower IL-6, ferritin, CRP, higher absolute lymphocyte count, and lower neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios at admission and peak lab values.\n\nComorbidity burden, per Charlson scores, were similar across genders, but specifically different: females had greater rates of obesity and asthma (P < 0.001). Heart disease (P=0.06), complicated hypertension (P < 0.01), chronic kidney disease, smoking, and alcohol use (P < 0.001) were all greater among males.\n\nMedication prescribed to combat SARS-CoV-2 was similarly frequent among men and women, though tocilizumab was prescribed more frequently to men.\n\nOverall, men had a greater incidence of severe disease and death outcomes across all observed age groups (36%) than women (36%; P < 0.001). The gender outcome difference was most significant among patients in the age 18-49 years group, where it was more than 2-fold for men (25% vs 11%; P < 0.001).\n\nDespite greater rates of obesity and asthma among hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, females were less frequently hospitalized due to the virus than men, and had less frequent severe outcomes, and presented with less severe respiratory and inflammatory parameters.\n\nThe findings highlight features of severe SARS-CoV-2 risk differences among men and women, and provide guidance closer to individualized risk reduction.\n\nDespite an excess of obesity, females had a lower severity of respiratory parameters and lower inflammatory markers on presentation and had a lower frequency of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sex and age interactions with severe disease highlight critical risk features unique to males and females.\n\n\"Taken together, these data suggest that sex differences in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent clinical presentations are the mediators of the differences we see in outcomes of males and females, and suggest that we should focus attention on the immune response after we encounter this virus.\"\n\n[byline: Kevin Kunzmann]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ref: Takahashi T, Ellingson MK, Wong P, et al.

Epub 2020 Aug 26; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2700-3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Abstract\n---------\n\"There is increasing evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) produces more severe symptoms and higher mortality among men than among women [1-5]. However, whether immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) differ between sexes, and whether such differences correlate with the sex difference in the disease course of COVID-19, is currently unknown. Here we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specifc antibody titres, plasma cytokines, and blood-cell phenotyping in patients with moderate COVID-19 who had not received immunomodulatory medications. Male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. By contrast, female patients had more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients' age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. By contrast, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression in female patients, but not in male patients. These findings provide a possible explanation for the observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide an important basis for the development of a sex-based approach to the treatment and care of male and female patients with COVID-19.\"\n\n\"Discussion\n-----------\n\"Our results revealed key differences in immune responses during the disease course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in male and female patients. First, we found that the levels of several important pro-inflammatory innate immunity chemokines and cytokines such as IL-8, IL-18 (at baseline) and CCL5 (longitudinal analysis) were higher in male patients, which correlated with higher non-classical monocytes (at baseline). Second, we observed a more robust T cell response among female patients than male patients at baseline. In particular, activated CD8 T cells were significantly increased only in female patients but not in male patients compared with healthy volunteers. Analysis of their clinical trajectory showed that, although poor T cell responses were associated with future progression of disease in male patients, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worsening of COVID-19 disease in female patients. Notably, the T cell response was significantly and negatively correlated with patients' age in male, but not female, patients. These data indicate key differences in the baseline immune capabilities in male and female patients during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest a potential immunological underpinning of the distinct mechanisms of disease progression between sexes. These analyses also provide a potential basis for taking sex-dependent approaches to prognosis, prevention, care, and therapy for patient with COVID-19.\"\nThe full article is available at the URL above. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] WHO updates (as of 9 Mar 2021)\n[A] Weekly epidemiological update\nDate: Tue 9 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO Emergency Situation Updates [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---10-march-2021\n\n\n[References, figures, and tables available from the pdf file at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP]\n\nData as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [7 Mar 2021], 10 am CET\n\nGlobal overview\n---------------\nOver 2.7 million new cases were reported last week, 2% more than in the previous week (Figure 1). The global case increase was driven by increases in the Eastern Mediterranean (10%), African Region (10%), and Europe (4%), while small declines were seen in the Americas (-2%), South East Asia (-2%), and Western Pacific regions (-6%). Globally, around half of countries are seeing declines while the other half are experiencing increasing numbers of new cases. Global new deaths continued the downward trend observed since early February 2021, declining a further 6% compared to last week. Death rates declined in all regions except in the Eastern Mediterranean, where new deaths reported rose by 9%. The Americas and Europe account for around 80% of new cases and new deaths reported globally.\n\nThe highest numbers of new cases were reported from the United States of America (427 233 new cases; 10% decrease), Brazil (413 597 new cases; 11% increase), France (143 622 new cases; 4% decrease), Italy (138 937 new cases; 24% increase), and India (114 068 new cases; 9% increase).\n\nFigure 1: COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO Region, and global deaths, as of [7 Mar 2021].\nFigure 2: COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population reported by countries, territories, and areas, [1-7 Mar 2021].\nTable 1. Newly reported and cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, by WHO Region, as of [7 Mar 2021].\n\nSpecial focus: Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System -- best practice for integrating influenza and COVID-19 sentinel surveillance\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHO estimates that seasonal influenza may result in 290 000-650 000 deaths each year due to respiratory diseases alone, with further deaths from other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, which can be influenza-related. SARS-CoV-2 is also a respiratory virus like influenza, but they are not the same virus. In 2020, there were around 1.8 million COVID-19 deaths. Influenza surveillance systems have been leveraged to support monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and have proven to be efficient, practical and sustainable. In this special focus, we look at how influenza surveillance systems work, how they are being used to provide effective support to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, and provide some country examples.

Further information on the background of the variants of concern (VOCs) is available from previously published editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports].\n\nHere we provide an update on ongoing studies and the geographical distribution of select VOCs as reported by countries, territories and areas (hereafter countries) as of [9 Mar 2021].\n\nResults of ongoing studies of VOCs are summarized in Table 2 below. While many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections, likely as a result of the public health and social measures (PHSM) implemented, an increased number of reports of variants have been noted in a number of countries. As surveillance activities at local and national levels are strengthened, including systematic genomic sequencing to detect cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, the number of countries reporting VOCs has continued to increase (Table 2, Figures 5, 6, and 7, Annex 2). This information should be interpreted with due consideration of limitations of ongoing surveillance, including but not limited to differences between countries in sequencing capacity and which samples are prioritized for sequencing. WHO continues to advocate for strengthening surveillance and sequencing capacity, and a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of variant transmission. New potential variants of interest (VOIs) or VOCs are currently under review and may be added to future updates.\n\nTable [2]: Overview of emerging information on key variants of concern, as of [9 Mar 2021].\n\n1. Variant VOC 202012/01\nSince our last update on [2 Mar 2021], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 5 additional countries. As of [9 Mar 2021], a total of 111 countries across all 6 WHO regions have reported cases of this variant (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Countries, territories, and areas reporting VOC 202012/01, as of [9 Mar 2021].\n\n2. Variant 501Y.V2\nSince the last update on [2 Mar 2021], 501Y.V2 has been reported from 3 additional countries -- totaling 58 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 6). In several areas within the African Region, variant 501Y.V2 has been reported to comprise a high proportion of sequenced samples. /35 Reductions in neutralizing antibody activity against 501Y.V2 following either natural infection or vaccination have been documented [4,24] and discussed in past editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update. Findings from a recent study that analyzed convalescent plasma from 20 patients and sera from 22 participants of vaccine trials [Moderna SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (12 participants); Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (10 participants)] indicated that relative to the original SARS-CoV-2, there was a substantial decrease in the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma (9.4-fold) and sera from vaccinated participants (10.3 to 12.4-fold) against the 501Y.V2 variant. [18]\n\nFigure 6: Countries, territories and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 as of [9 Mar 2021].\n\n3. Variant P.1\nSince our last update, variant P.1 has been reported in 3 additional countries. As of [9 Mar 2021], this variant is reported in 32 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Countries, territories, and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant as of [9 Mar 2021].\n\nBrazil has experienced high incidence and mortality due to COVID-19, recording over 11 million cases and 260 000 deaths (as of [7 Mar 2021]); the 2nd highest globally (Figure 8). The burden of COVID-19 has been highly variable across the country, with Amazonas State and its capital Manaus, being the most affected. [6] There has been a sharp increase in cases and deaths reported in the month of January [2021], however, both the cases and deaths have slowly started to decline in these states (Figure 9), while remaining high or increasing in the country overall.\n\nIn a genomic survey conducted from [16 Mar 2020] to [13 Jan 2021] in 25 municipalities of Amazonas State, Brazil, several sequences were identified. [25] Variant P.1, which was 1st detected in early December 2020 in Manaus in Amazons state, displayed a rapid increase in prevalence through January 2021; accounting 24% (n=60) of sequences samples included in this study. In addition, to better understand the emergence of P.1 in the Amazonas State, a real-time PCR assay was performed to detect the deletion at orf1ab (NSP6: S106del, G107del, F108del) - a deletion found in all 3 VOCs (P.1, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351). Upon evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples between [1 Nov 2020] through [31 Jan 2021] but not sequenced, no sample was found positive for the NSP6 deletion before [16 Dec 2020], supporting low prevalence of VOC P.1 before mid-December 2020 in Amazonas. However, between mid-December 2020 and January 2021, positive samples with NSP6 deletion were very frequent. Collectively these studies highlight a sharp increase in prevalence of variant P.1 from 0% in November 2020 (n=0/88) to 73% during [1-15 Jan 2021] (n=119/162).\n\nBased on preliminary investigations in Manaus, where this variant was initially identified, P.1 has shown to have increased transmissibility compared to previously circulating variants. It can evade 25% to 61% protective immunity provided by the previous infection, thereby making people susceptible to reinfection. [6] In addition, it is 1.1-1.8 times more likely to result in mortality. Researchers have cautioned that these are preliminary findings and the results are not generalizable to other settings. More studies and genome sequencing data are required to assess the transmissibility and severity of variant P.1. It is also important to conduct these studies outside of Manaus as there has been a sharp increase in hospitalizations during the 2nd wave which has resulted in collapsing of health systems in Manaus (Figure 9). Therefore, it is difficult to determine the cause of high mortality which could be either due to variant P.1 or collapsed health systems, or both.\n\nFigure 8: Weekly COVID-19 cases per 1 million population in Brazil, as of [7 Mar 2021]).\nFigure 9: COVID-19 cases, deaths (as of [28 Feb 2021]), and hospitalizations (as of [21 Feb 2021]) in Amazonas and Manaus, Brazil.\n\nWHO recommendations\n-------------------\nPublic health and social measures [PHSM] remain critically important to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including newly reported variants. Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the implementation of physical distancing and other PHSM, as well as infection prevention and control measures in health facilities, has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients. Findings from new studies evaluating transmission, severity, and impact on medical countermeasures will continue to help inform PHSM and IPC measures employed by member states. National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing PHSM, IPC [infection prevention and control] and disease control activities, including epidemiological surveillance, strategic testing, and systematic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 where feasible.\n\nIf potential VOIs or VOCs are detected, member states are requested to inform WHO through established WHO Country or Regional Office reporting channels, submit genome sequences to publicly available databases (such as GISAID), and perform field and laboratory investigations (where appropriate) to improve understanding of potential impacts.\n\nSituation by WHO Region\n-----------------------\n[Epidemic curves for each region are available from the pdf file at the source URL above]\n\n- African Region\nThe Africa region reported over 55 000 new cases and over 1300 new deaths, a 10% increase and 16% decrease respectively compared to the previous week. Since new weekly case counts peaked in early January 2021, this is the 1st weekly increase following 6 weeks of decreasing case numbers. The highest numbers of new cases were reported from South Africa (7981 new cases; 13.5 new cases per 100 000 population; a 19% decrease), Ethiopia (6976 new cases; 6.1 new cases per 100 000; a 13% increase), and Zambia (4840 new cases; 26.3 new cases per 100 000; a 48% increase).

The spike in deaths observed last week were driven by retro-adjustments in Nepal.\n\n- Western Pacific Region\nThe Western Pacific region reported over 41 000 new cases and over 600 new deaths, a 6% and 20% decrease respectively compared to the previous week. New weekly cases have continued to decrease since mid-January 2021, and deaths have decreased overall in recent weeks.

The female _Aedes aegypti_ -- also known as the yellow fever mosquito -- is the only insect that can spread dengue fever [not true. _Aedes albopictus_, the Asian tiger mosquito, can also transmit dengue viruses. - Mod.TY]\n\nDuring routine exotic mosquito surveillance in Tennant Creek, about 1000 km [620 mi] south of Darwin, 3 females and one male were trapped by medical entomology officers.\n\nNo cases of dengue fever have been diagnosed and the virus is not present in the Territory, NT Health says.\n\nIt's likely the mosquitoes were accidentally brought from Queensland by road, medical entomologist Bill Pettit said on [Tue 9 Mar 2021]. 'The dengue mosquito was eliminated from the NT in the mid-1950s and has not become permanently established since,' he said. However, it did make it back into the Territory on 3 occasions -- Tennant Creek in 2004 and 2011, and on Groote Eylandt in 2006 -- requiring 'a comprehensive 2 year program' to eliminate the insect.\n\nHealth officers will travel to Tennant Creek this month to search for more dengue mosquitoes and larvae.\n\nThe insect is often found around homes and typically lay their eggs in water-filled containers such as buckets, animal dishes and flower pots. The eggs can survive in the dry for up 12 months and follow-up visits are likely to be required after the next rains to ensure the mosquito is eliminated. Tennant Creek residents have been urged to tip out any water from containers around their homes until their properties have been inspected.\n\nDengue fever is usually found in tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. An outbreak also occurs in North Queensland each year. Symptoms are high fever, a rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, there is serious bleeding and shock, which can be life-threatening.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This discovery of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Northern Territory (NT) after a long absence illustrates the ease with which this mosquito can be moved through human activity. NT health authorities are prudent to respond aggressively and eliminate this mosquito while its numbers are small and its location is limited. This mosquito is established in northern Queensland and transmits dengue viruses there -- something to be avoided in dengue-free NT. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nNorthern Territory, Australia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292]\nSee Also\n2015\n---\nInvasive mosquito - Australia, Belgium 20150820.3590389\n.................................................sb/sh/ty/ao/sh", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8236250", "headline": "COVID-19 update (91): USA post vacc, vacc passport, WHO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8236250", "date": "2021-03-09 07:02:58", "main_text": "CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 UPDATE (91): USA POST VACCINATION, EUROPE VACCINATION PASSPORTS, WHO\n*********************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] USA: CDC post vaccination recommendations\n[2] Europe: vaccination passport\n[3] COVID news snippets\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 8 Mar 2021)\n[5] Global update: Worldometer accessed 8 Mar 2021 22:30 EST (GMT-5)\n\n******\n[1] USA: CDC post vaccination recommendations\n[A] Media report\nDate: Mon 8 Mar 2021 11:08 AM ET\nSource: NPR (National Public Radio) [edited]\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/08/974783644/cdc-says-its-safe-for-vaccinated-people-to-do-these-activities\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new guidance for vaccinated people, giving the green light to resume some pre-pandemic activities and relax precautions that have been in place.\n\nSpecifically, the new guidance says, people who are fully vaccinated can visit indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or social distancing. People are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after they have gotten the 2nd shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or 2 weeks after receiving the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine).\n\nVaccinated people can also visit, unmasked, with people from another household who are not yet vaccinated, as long as those people are at low risk of serious illness from the virus. However, the agency said, vaccinated people should continue to wear masks when they're in public, avoid crowds, and take other precautions when gathering with unvaccinated people who are at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19.\n\nThe new guidance also allows fully vaccinated individuals to forgo testing and quarantining following a known COVID-19 exposure, as long as they are not experiencing symptoms.\n\nCDC said this new guidance is a \"1st step\" to returning to everyday activities. There's accumulating evidence to show that people who are fully vaccinated are less likely to become infected and also \"potentially\" less likely to spread the virus to others, agency officials wrote in a press release. \"We know that people want to get vaccinated so they can get back to doing the things they enjoy with the people they love,\" CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said in a statement about the new guidelines.\n\nThe new guidance is specific to freedoms that vaccinated people can resume in their own homes, but the agency warns that everyone -- even those who are vaccinated -- should continue to follow recommended guidelines in public settings, including wearing masks.\n\nCDC is not updating its travel guidance at this time, Walensky said at a White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing on Monday [8 Mar 2021]. She stressed that everyone should continue to avoid nonessential trips, regardless of vaccination status. The CDC director cited previous spikes in case counts after surges in travel and the emergence of variants from international locations. Existing travel guidance still applies in the case of fully vaccinated grandparents who are hoping to visit their low-risk family members, Walensky said in response to a reporter's question. \"We would like to give the opportunity to vaccinated grandparents to visit their grandchildren and children who are healthy and who are local, but our travel guidance currently has been unchanged,\" she said.\n\nThe 3 available vaccines have been proven to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, Walensky added. But she said there is still a small risk that vaccinated people could become infected with a mild or asymptomatic disease and potentially even pass it on to others who are not vaccinated. She said this remains an ongoing area of research. Walensky said this is the 1st round of guidance, but more will follow as the science evolves and more people are fully vaccinated. \"We believe these recommendations are an important 1st step in our efforts to resume everyday activities in our communities,\" she said. \"However, we remain in the midst of a serious pandemic, and still over 90% of our population is not fully vaccinated, though we are working hard to get there.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is working to scale up vaccine manufacturing and distribution and announced last week [week of 1 Mar 2021] that the country will have enough supply for every adult by the end of May [2021]. The country's 7-day average of daily vaccinations is nearly 2.2 million, and a record-breaking 2.9 million doses were administered on Saturday [6 Mar 2021], according to Andy Slavitt, White House senior adviser on the White House COVID-19 Response Team. Walensky said that as of Monday [8 Mar 2021], about 59 million people in the US have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. And about 31 million people -- or 9.2% of the U.S. population -- are fully vaccinated.\n\nHere's CDC's specific guidance for what fully vaccinated people can do:\n-\"visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing;\n- \"visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing;\n- \"refrain from quarantine and testing following a known exposure to COVID-19 if asymptomatic.\"\n\nCDC said fully vaccinated people should continue to take these COVID-19 precautions:\n- \"take precautions in public like wearing a well-fitted mask and physical distancing;\n- \"wear masks, practice physical distancing, and adhere to other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease or who have an unvaccinated household member who is at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease;\n- \"wear masks, maintain physical distance, and practice other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households;\n- \"avoid medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings;\n- \"get tested if experiencing COVID-19 symptoms;\n- \"follow guidance issued by individual employers;\n- \"follow CDC and health department travel requirements and recommendations.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nSukie Crandall\n<sukie@mac.com>\n\n----\n[B] CDC\nDate: Mon 8 Mar 2021\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html\n\n\nWhen you've been fully vaccinated -- How to protect yourself and others\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCOVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from getting sick. Based on what we know about COVID-19 vaccines, people who have been fully vaccinated can start to do some things that they had stopped doing because of the pandemic.\n\nWe're still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. After you've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet [2 m] apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces until we know more.\n\nWhat's changed\n--------------\nIf you've been fully vaccinated:\n- You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask.\n- You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\n- If you've been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.\n- However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don't have symptoms.\n\nWhat hasn't changed\n-------------------\nFor now, if you've been fully vaccinated:\n- You should still take steps to protect yourself and others in many situations, like wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet a[2 m] part from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. Take these precautions whenever you are:\n-- in public;\n-- gathering with unvaccinated people from more than one other household;\n-- visiting with an unvaccinated person who is at increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 or who lives with a person at increased risk.\n- You should still avoid medium or large-sized gatherings.\n- You should still delay domestic and international travel. If you do travel, you'll still need to follow CDC requirements and recommendations.\n- You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you've been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others.\n- You will still need to follow guidance at your workplace.\n\nWhat we know and what we're still learning\n------------------------------------------\n- We know that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death.\n- We're still learning how effective the vaccines are against variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. Early data show the vaccines may work against some variants but could be less effective against others.\n- We know that other prevention steps help stop the spread of COVID-19 and that these steps are still important, even as vaccines are being distributed.\n- We're still learning how well COVID-19 vaccines keep people from spreading the disease.\n- Early data show that the vaccines may help keep people from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated.\n- We're still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines can protect people.\n- As we know more, CDC will continue to update our recommendations for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\n\nUntil we know more about those questions, everyone -- even people who've had their vaccines -- should continue taking basic prevention steps when recommended.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cautions I am concerned about deal with the final section above: \"What we know and what we're still learning\". The media have picked up the \"do's and don'ts\", but haven't mentioned the as yet still unknowns that may influence these current recommendations.

But what some countries see as a path toward reopening has been viewed by others, led by France and Germany, as a path toward a 2-tier system that could leave the unvaccinated as outsiders in places such as gyms, restaurants, and cinemas. \"Immunity passports could reinforce inequalities both within and between countries,\" said Emilian Kavalski, a professor at the University of Nottingham's campus in Ningbo, China.\n\nSome countries have already taken steps in that direction. In Britain, now outside the EU, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said vaccine certificates are \"under consideration\" even as other British officials dismissed the idea. Israel recently launched digital vaccination certificates to allow access to gyms or restaurants.\n\nIsrael also agreed to trial a travel bubble with EU members Greece and Cyprus to open the door for vaccinated travelers. Meanwhile, Cyprus has also said it will begin in May [2021] to welcome vaccinated visitors from Britain.\n\nThe European Commission is expected to submit a proposal on how to bridge the divides with the bloc this month [March 2021], which could lay out a joint plan for digital vaccination certificates that would work across the EU and potentially beyond.\n\nCompromise proposals could include exceptions for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 or those who can provide a recent negative test result. It is unclear what a digital vaccine certificate would look like. Personalized QR codes -- used in Israel and difficult to forge -- would be one possible option.\n\nBut finding common ground across the EU will not be easy. Vaccination rates vary widely. So does the political will to put the vaccinated in the fast lane for travel -- with countries most dependent on tourism cash leading the way. \"Those who are vaccinated should have full freedom,\" said Austria's chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who has joined Greece and Spain in support of vaccination documents. \"Some countries are very much preoccupied with now,\" Greece's tourism minister, Harry Theocharis, told the Financial Times last month [February 2021], in an apparent reference to German and French hesitancy.\n\nTourism accounts for about 20 per cent of Greece's GDP, which declined by 10 per cent last year [2020]. \"People will gradually realize that there is not much of an alternative,\" Andreas Papatheodorou, a Greek tourism researcher, said. If no EU-wide solution can be found, Greece and other countries may opt for bilateral deals, he said.\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has signalled openness to study possible vaccination certificates later this year [2021]. But she has insisted treating vaccinated travelers preferentially now \"isn't on the agenda, given the low vaccination coverage at this point\". French officials have made the same argument. They also appear worried about how a proposed pass would be received by the large number of vaccine skeptics in the country. Only around half the population was willing to get vaccinated when the rollout began 2 months ago. French vaccine approval has recently inched upward. Some officials still fear a \"vaccination passport\" would risk undoing that progress.\n\nSome groups -- including members of ethnic minorities or pregnant women -- would be disproportionately impacted, because COVID vaccination rates among them are lower than in the general population, according to recent studies. Young people who are last in line to receive vaccines or older people with no smartphones would also be disadvantaged.\n\nThere is also still no scientific consensus on the extent to which vaccines reduce transmission of the virus, raising the possibility that vaccinated travelers might spread the virus even if they do not get sick themselves, said Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at Oxford University.\n\nPresident Biden said last week that there will be enough vaccines for all US adults by May [2021]. The European Commission hopes to vaccinate 70 per cent of the EU's adult population by the end of the summer [2021], which would still leave more than 100 million Europeans without immunization in late September [2021].\n\n\"If you introduce this right away, you'd be excluding a huge group just on age-based discrimination,\" Mills said of possible \"vaccine passports,\" adding that court challenges would probably follow.\n\nOther questions are piling up, too. Would EU citizens qualify for a certificate if they receive vaccines not approved by the EU drug regulator, such as Russia's Sputnik V and Chinese vaccines? What happens if variants spread that reduce some vaccines' efficacy?\n\nThen there are privacy concerns. For decades, paper certificates have been used for travel to show vaccinations against yellow fever and other diseases. But a digital certification, potentially with QR-codes, raises worries about whether the data could be used to track travelers' movements.\n\nSome global companies have already vowed to make use of their right to ban customers. Alan Joyce, the head of Australia's carrier Qantas, said last year [2020] that proof of vaccination would soon become a prerequisite for flying. \"I think that's going to be a common thing, talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe,\" he said. Similar requirements could be introduced for people entering sports stadiums or workplaces.\n\nThe idea of requiring travelers to carry health certificates is a relatively modern concept, said Kavalski, who has researched the historical evolution of passports. Passports were widely introduced during World War I in what some saw as a temporary measure. But the 1918 flu pandemic helped shape international travel with \"the practice of allowing only 'healthy' bodies to cross borders,\" Kavalski said. \"I would say the [current] pandemic will have a lasting impact on the practices and experience of border crossing,\" Kavalski said.\n\n[byline: Rick Noack]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Clearly, the use of vaccination passports is highly controversial as we see discussions play out in Europe at present. The concerns about privacy violations can and could be accepted as for the better public good. With our digital footprints currently, it is a false sense of security that privacy is preserved as evidenced by all of the tracking apps, etc, that have been put into play during the pandemic. The discrimination argument is valid before all adults have access to vaccine. As for those that refuse vaccine, they have exercised their right to refuse, but is there an inherent right for them to put others at risk? There are anecdotal reports of individuals who, knowing themselves to be ill with SARS-CoV-2 infection, have boarded planes to travel. Unfortunately, where there's a will there's a way. While the feeling is that the bar code passports are harder to forge, what about healthcare personnel who are not supporting vaccinations providing such passport authorizations? I am probably making many enemies by my comments here, but I hope I am communicating there are many issues to be resolved before such passports could and should be adopted. I suggest reading a 22 Jan 2021 article raising concerns re the use of health passport (https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/01/22/passport-vaccine-covid-flights-international/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_53). It points out the concerns re dropping quarantine and testing requirements for travellers who are fully vaccinated -- a legitimate concern as we still don't know the impact of vaccination on transmission of the virus, especially the variants. Not a black and white debate here. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[3] COVID-19 news snippets\nDate: Tue 9 Mar 2021\nSource: The Washington Post [edited]\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/08/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/\n\n\nHealth experts worry about variant-driven surge as states lift restrictions\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nAs authorities relax restrictions meant to curb the coronavirus and the race to vaccinate the public remain under way, experts say the US sits at a potential inflection point, with highly contagious variants threatening an additional surge. Michael T Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy [CIDRAP] at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to President Biden's coronavirus task force, said during a Sunday [7 Mar 2021] interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the nation is \"in the eye of the hurricane\". Other epidemiologists cited concern over the looming spring break season, saying it could accelerate the spread of the new variants.\n\nHere are some significant developments:\n- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance on what fully vaccinated Americans can do, saying they can visit nearby grandchildren and dine with one another indoors.\n- Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma, have tested positive for the coronavirus, his office announced on Monday [8 Mar 2021].

And everyone in between.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic brought out stories of profound grief and heroic resolve.\nThese are not those stories.\n\nInstead, at this one-year mark, Style [Washington Post] reporters set out to note some of the other, countless emotions and personal losses: The almost-9 year old who never felt like she got to be 8. The 102 year old who lives in mandated isolation. The massage therapist and her customers who simply crave touch. The couple who postponed their big wedding -- and may have to postpone it again. The single person losing her last sense of social contact. The DJ who spins for an empty room. The college freshman who has never set foot on campus. Shutdowns, lockdowns, quarantines -- whatever you called this long and lost time, these stories acknowledge the persistent disconnect, all that absence, and what it feels like to live in a suspended state of mind.\n\n- 8:45 a.m.\nChina awash in 'cherry freedom' despite virus fears\nAmong Chinese youths, the term \"cherry freedom\" has meant the aspirational level of financial security where you can buy premium fruits whenever the whim strikes. So it came as a shock when cherry freedom suddenly arrived for everyone. In January [2021], Chinese media reported that packaging from a shipment of Chilean cherries had tested positive for the coronavirus. In the confusion that followed, Chinese retailers dumped cherry orders and consumers shunned the fruit. Chinese health experts went on TV to say cherries were safe to eat if you washed them (the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk from eating or handling food is \"very low\"), while Chile's embassy said it hadn't been confirmed that the tainted batch was from Chile. But it was too late: Prices collapsed as 288 000 tons of imported Chilean cherries approached their expiration date.\n[byline: Lyric Li, Eva Dou]\n\n- 8:00 a.m.\nAnalysis: What the media should not do when battling vaccine misinformation\nThere are all sorts of ways to counter reluctance to get the coronavirus vaccine. There's leading by example. There's guilt. And there's pure charm. Dolly Parton went the latter route last week [2 Mar 2021] as she got her 1st shot, wearing a sparkly blue cold-shoulder dress for her Instagram PSA and crooning \"Vaccine\" to the tune of her signature \"Jolene\". Despite all this high-level persuasion, a big chunk of Americans -- about 3 in 10 -- remain hesitant, according to a new Pew Research survey. The news media has a role to play -- not in outright advocacy, but in relentlessly providing accurate, nuanced information and answering questions straightforwardly. \"There is a lot to be said for honestly reporting as much context as possible and knowing the terrain into which your sound bites and headlines will play,\" said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.\n[byline: Margaret Sullivan]\n\n- 7:15 a.m.\nPeople threaten to call ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] after a Mexican restaurant in Texas keeps its mask rules\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic hit and restaurant owners faced difficult decisions, the Richards family that owns Picos, a Mexican restaurant in Houston, quickly adapted to continue sharing their Latin cuisine -- from selling to-go margarita kits to stationing a mariachi band at the curbside pickup. This week, after Texas governor Greg Abbott (R) said on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021] that he would rescind the statewide mask mandate, while the vast majority of residents remain unvaccinated, the tough choice to enforce public health guidance fell to business owners, and Picos announced it would continue requiring masks. But, after such a challenging year, the reaction to their decision was disheartening, co-owner Monica Richards said: Several people sent hateful messages through social media and called the restaurant, threatening to report staffers to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n[byline: Meryl Kornfield]\n\n- 6:31 a.m.\nThe whiplash of Pope Francis's Iraq trip: A year of tight COVID-19 rules in Italy, then 72 hours of crowds\nAboard the papal plane -- By almost every measurement, Pope Francis's trip to Iraq was stunning. He went to a country no pope had visited before, at a time when few other global figures were traveling. He led prayer in the very place where, just 7 years earlier, the Islamic State's leader had proclaimed a caliphate that would \"conquer Rome\". The crowds were adoring, ululating, sometimes crying. The theater was unbeatable. And yet, amid all this, I kept thinking about the coronavirus. Almost everywhere Francis went, there were crowds. Big crowds of unvaccinated people, shoulder-to-shoulder. Francis's outdoor Mass in Irbil, capital of the semiautonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan, had nearly the attendance of the Super Bowl, but in a dramatically smaller stadium; few were wearing masks. Most startling was an indoor Mass on Saturday night [5 Mar 2021] in Baghdad, in a packed church with people singing and almost no ventilation. I was a pool reporter for that service; it felt like standing in a coronavirus nuclear reactor[see photograph at https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DC446WT73UI6XPRCGLJTDWDVGA.jpg&w=916\n[byline: Chico Harlan]\n\n- 5:47 a.m.\nHow a year lived online has changed our children\nLike many parents just trying to get to the other side of a pandemic in one piece, [I L-L] doesn't have the bandwidth to micromanage screen time for her 2 older kids. By giving up some, but not all, control, she and other parents have been able to see firsthand the good and bad of letting kids lead the way with their own technology usage. \"Screen time\" -- as a concept to track meticulously, to fret and panic about, to measure parents' worth in -- is no longer considered a valid framework in a pandemic world, where the way we live our lives has been completely redefined. Since schools in the United States began closing down roughly a year ago, the country's children have been adapting, learning, and getting creative with how they use technology. The realities of their day-to-day lives have varied wildly, as have their relationships with screens.\n[byline: Heather Kelly]\n\n- 4:45 a.m.\nJapan battles new variants as vaccine program is in disarray\nJapan's coronavirus vaccination program is in disarray -- mostly from self-inflicted wounds. Vaccinations are at a crawl, upending hopeful predictions that life could start to return to normal by the summer. Even before a 3rd wave of infections is under control, many health experts are predicting another possible surge ahead of the summer's Olympics. Japan's government boasts of its success in containing the worst of the pandemic. But medical experts tell a different story -- a failure to meet the moment, and of a slow-moving government and bureaucracy struggling to adapt to a fast-moving pandemic. It adds up to a jolting contrast as many other wealthy nations have their feet on the gas to accelerate and expand vaccinations. Japan's very slow rollout also is likely to undermine support for beleaguered prime minister Yoshihide Suga and delay Japan's economic recovery.\n\n- 4:02 a.m.\nIsrael begins vaccinating 100 000 Palestinian day laborers\nIsrael on Monday [8 Mar 2021] kicked off its 2-week campaign to vaccinate more than 100 000 Palestinians carrying Israeli work permits even as coronavirus vaccinations remained a distant dream for most residents of the West Bank. At the crossing of Sha'ar Efraim, the Israeli military set up one of 8 vaccination centers -- with the capacity to vaccinate 1000 people a day -- along the 440-mile [708 km] barrier dividing Israel from the Palestinian territories. \"It is within both Israeli and Palestinian interests that we vaccinate the workers, since, as we know, coronavirus knows no geographical boundaries,\" said Lior Wisbaum, foreign relations officer for the coordinator of government activities in the Territories, or COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates with the Palestinian Authority.\n[byline: Shira Rubin]\n\n- 2:57 a.m.\nWhite House: 'Hopeful day' as vaccinations jump, Senate passes American Rescue Plan, CDC issues guidance\nThe Biden administration on Monday [8 Mar 2021] touted the increased pace of vaccinations and the Senate's passage of the American Rescue Plan as promising signs in the \"war\" on the coronavirus. \"President Biden came into office with 2 clear immediate goals -- mount a vaccination program to turn the tide on the pandemic and pass a rescue plan to bring the nation through these tough times successfully,\" Andy Slavitt, senior White House adviser for the coronavirus response, told reporters at a press briefing. \"This weekend, we took critical steps on both fronts.\" Slavitt noted that the nation's vaccination pace has sped up, with nearly 2.2 million shots a day administered in the past week, up from about 900 000 when Biden took office [20 Jan 2021]. Slavitt also said that Congress's USD1.9 trillion legislative package, directed by Biden, would address poverty while ramping up other resources to fight the pandemic. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who's leading the Biden administration's work on health equity and the coronavirus, pointed to progress rolling out community vaccination centers that are focused on hard-hit, high-risk communities. \"By the end of this week, we'll have 18 of those sites running across 7 states, with the ability to administer 61 000 total shots per week,\" Nunez-Smith said. Nunez-Smith also said that the administration is still working on its planned messaging campaign to address vaccine hesitancy. Nearly one-third of GOP voters say they \"definitely won't\" get the vaccine, and polls have found widespread skepticism in communities of color, as well. Meanwhile, Anthony S Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert, offered a brief update on researchers' efforts to develop antivirals that hinder the progression of COVID-19 symptoms and help infected people avoid needing to be hospitalized. \"That is the direction that we will be going over the next weeks to months to years,\" Fauci said, comparing the fight to the effort to combat HIV. At the briefing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky also unveiled long-awaited guidance on how vaccinated Americans can socialize and pursue daily activities. \"I hope people view this as a hopeful day in the next steps of the pandemic,\" Slavitt said.\n[byline: Dan Diamond]\n\n- 2:52 a.m.\nSWAT [special weapons and tactics, a law enforcement unit]] team called into maskless Boulder college party where students set off fireworks and flipped a car\nBy the time police arrived, the party had been raging for hours. Beginning late Saturday afternoon [6 Mar 2021], music bumped as 500 -- 800 maskless revelers swarmed a street in a neighborhood near the University of Colorado at Boulder. The cheering crowd later blasted fireworks into the sky and flipped a car. Law enforcement officers showed up with a SWAT vehicle at about 8:30 pm local time. Using a loudspeaker, they warned, \"If you fail to leave, you will be subject to arrest and the use of tear gas.\" Many students cleared out. Others stayed, shouting expletives at police. About 100 ran toward authorities, police said, and several threw bottles and rocks. The chaos, which unfolded a day after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) paid tribute to the state's nearly 6000 COVID-19 victims, ended with police reporting minor injuries to several officers, along with damage to community and public-safety vehicles.\n[byline: Brittany Shammas]\n\n- 1:19 a.m.\nInside Biden's struggle to meet his school reopening promises\nThe promise was clear and hopeful: With strong public health measures, then-president-elect Joe Biden declared in early December [2020], \"the majority of our schools can be open by the end of my 1st 100 days.\" The reality has been far more complicated. First came the clarification on Biden's 1st full day as president, when the administration released a 200-page coronavirus response plan that explained the schools reopening plan included only K-8 schools -- not high schools -- in those 1st 100 days. Then came a walk-back from White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who said the administration's goal was only to have the majority of schools back in classrooms \"at least one day a week.\" And finally came Biden's walk-back of the walk-back in a CNN town hall, where he described the one-day-a-week standard as a \"mistake in the communication.\"\n[byline: Ashley Parker, Laura Meckler, Fenit Nirappil, Annie Linskey]\n\n- 12:18 a.m.\nMeet the GOP [Republican Party] voters who could decide whether the US reaches herd immunity\n[M], an 80 year old retiree who lives outside Tulsa, has spent the past year living in fear of the coronavirus.

Some very poignant vignettes are included, description of fear in some individuals, defiant responses by others, some trying to provide guidance and support to individuals struggling to make it through the pandemic, and more. Children to seniors have been affected, as has every single individual by this viral disease, either directly or indirectly. One hopes that should an existing or new variant pose even a graver risk, vaccine makers will be able to respond rapidly as they are currently doing. And further, one hopes the public health infrastructure that has been strengthened by this pandemic will be maintained to battle the next outbreak, which no doubt will come in the future. Trained health care and laboratory personnel are a precious commodity that must be protected. The lessons learned from how this pandemic was handled should be discussed and plans made so mistakes are not repeated. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 8 Mar 2021)\nDate: Mon 8 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 8 Mar 2021 18:02 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n----------------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 668 791 (6514) / 29 725 (88)\nEuropean Region (61): 39 892 674 (117 265) / 885 846 (1628)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 710 065 (25 671) / 210 443 (229)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 650 125 (33 285) / 147 689 (405)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 51 694 320 (162 882) / 1 242 308 (4527)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 904 561 (9012) / 73 524 (143)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 116 521 281 (354 629) / 2 589 548 (7020)\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 8 Mar 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20update%208%20Mar%202021_1615237548.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 45.9% of daily case numbers and 64.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 51.69 million cases.

That being said, positive environmental samples mean that the virus is actively circulating. But, 2020 was a major year for cVDPV outbreaks with a total to date of 1067 confirmed AFP cases associated with circulating vaccine derived polioviruses and in 2021, as of 3 Mar, 13 cases have already been reported. Countries involved included Eurasia (Tajikistan), Middle East (Egypt, Yemen), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Malaysia), Africa (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia.

So one case of WPV2 polio means 1000-2000 silent infections. cVDPV has a lower risk of paralysis, the case-to-infection ratio may be between 1 to 5000-10 000. That is the reason why we cannot rely on AFP surveillance for detecting the prevalence of cVDPV-2 but need sewage surveillance.\n\nIn 2020, if there were 1048 confirmed cases of polio due to cVDPV-2, that means the size of the silent epidemic was at least 1048 x 5000 = 5 240 000 [updating this calculation to 1067 cases, 5 335 000 infections - Mod.MPP]\n\nWaiting for novel OPV [oral poliovirus vaccines] is not enough. There is no guarantee the eradication program can eradicate cVDPV-2 in one or 2 years. If we had 5 million cVDPV infections in 2020, the probability that it will further de-attenuate and become genotypically and phenotypically closer to wild virus than vaccine virus is high. Immediate and widespread IPV [inactivated polio vaccine] by campaign is the necessary intervention now.\n\nIf that is not operationally feasible, EPI [Expanded Program on Immunization] must revise its immunisation policy to recommend \"at least 2 doses\" of IPV, stand-alone or combination vaccine. I say this because \"at least 1 dose of IPV\" is part of the eradication program.\n\nIf stand-alone, then 14 weeks and 9 months of age should be ideal, to match with 2 contacts for other vaccines, or if combination vaccine, 3 doses as per the current EPI schedule. This is ethically necessary. No excuses like high cost or low coverage, etc. should be used to delay this decision. No child ever had polio after 2 well-timed IPV doses or 3 EPI schedule IPV doses. Preventing polio is the primary duty of the eradication program; this will not in any way interfere with the interventions deemed necessary by the eradication program.\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n439, Civil Supplies Godown Lane\nKamalakshipuram\nVellore, TN 632002\nIndia\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n[ProMED would like to thank Dr T Jacob John for his very insightful comment. Clearly, the vaccine (OPV) has become a major part of the polio problem globally with cVDPV cases exploding in many countries (see sections [1] and [2] above. The call to change vaccines to IPV should be loud and clear. Arguments on the cost of the change should include calculations of the cost of the cases of cVDPV associated disease and the cost of the repeated mop up outbreak control vaccination campaigns. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[4] Cameroon: impact of COVID-19\nDate: Sun 7 Mar 2021 08:24 PM WAT\nSource: Voice of America (VOA) News [edited]\nhttps://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/cameroon-reports-polio-cases-amid-covid-scare\n\n\nCameroon says 2 polio cases discovered in the capital, Yaounde, 3 weeks ago are a consequence of people refusing to inoculate their children for fear of being infected by COVID-19. The central African state has redeployed health teams to all towns and villages to ask parents to vaccinate their children.\n\nCameroon says it has dispatched health workers to 360 hospitals as part of an awareness campaign against polio. Tetanye Ekoe, president of Cameroon's National Polio Certification Commission, said the awareness teams will teach communities to observe hygiene and to intensify routine immunization, and epidemiological surveillance.\n\nHe said the discovery of 2 type 2 polio cases in Yaounde 3 weeks ago should serve as a wake-up call for people who have turned their backs on polio vaccination. He said it is an illusion to think that the government is hiding behind vaccinations to harm its citizens. Ekoe said he is calling on all Cameroonians to inoculate their children and convince others to take their children to vaccination centers. He said the emergence of polio shows a weak collective immunity. Ekoe said some polio cases may still be undetected because many parents have not been bringing their children to the hospitals out of fear of COVID-19 infection.\n\nCameroon was declared polio-free in 2015, but in 2019, the government of the central African state announced a resurgence on its northern border with Nigeria. The new polio cases were reported in Cameroon in the middle of the 2nd wave of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis month [March 2021] Cameroon's Public Health Ministry reported that the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 had increased from 26 000 to 39 000 between January [2021] and February [2021].\n\nIn December [2020], the government said more than 240 000 children had not received polio vaccines since COVID-19 cases were first reported in Cameroon last March [2020]. The government said parents were refusing to take their children to the hospitals for inoculation because of fear of the coronavirus.\n\nEkoe said rumors last month [February 2021] that the government would secretly vaccinate all Cameroonians against COVID-19 further discouraged people who are scared of the vaccine from visiting hospitals.\n\nPrime minister Joseph Dion Ngute denied in a message Friday [5 Mar 2021] that Cameroon is vaccinating all its citizens who visit hospitals against COVID-19. Ngute said Cameroon is still negotiating to buy a million coronavirus vaccine doses, which will not be administered to people who do not want them. \"Once this vaccine become available, vaccination shall be voluntary,\" he said. \"I would like to note that although vaccination is voluntary and not compulsory, the government encourages all Cameroonians to be vaccinated when the time comes in order to acquire the immunity that will enable our community to protect itself against COVID-19 for a return to normalcy.\"\n\nOn [25 Aug 2020], the World Health Organization announced that wild poliovirus had been eradicated from Africa after 4 consecutive years without any reported cases and massive efforts to immunize children. The WHO said polio-free Africa was a historic moment, moving the world closer to achieving global polio eradication.\n\nThe WHO statement said only Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to see wild poliovirus transmission.\n\nPolio affects mostly young children. Cameroon did not say if the new cases were detected in children or adults.\n\n[byline: Moki Edwin Kindzeka]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Polio vaccination activities are on the list of activities suffering collateral damage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, vaccination activities were interrupted, now there is fear on the part of the population that visiting health facilities for vaccination will put them at high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. A very sad outcome of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global, WPV1, cDPV 20210222.8205197\nPoliomyelitis update (01): Pakistan, global (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone) RFI 20210102.8064119\n2020\n---\nPoliomyelitis update (24): global (WPV1; cVDPV2) 20201229.8053858\nPoliomyelitis update (23): Afghanistan (KT, PK), RFI 20201222.8039231\nPoliomyelitis update (22): Pakistan (BA) 20201220.8033764\nPoliomyelitis update (21): global, Sierra Leone, RFI 20201217.8026377\nPoliomyelitis update (20): Sierra Leone, cVDPV 20201215.8021230\nPoliomyelitis update (19): comment 20201212.8013854\nPoliomyelitis update (18): cVDPV2 (Pakistan, CAR, Chad, Somalia), nOPV2 20201211.8009474\nPoliomyelitis update (17): Africa declared wild poliovirus free 20200826.7716288\nCOVID-19 update (77): global, polio vacc on hold, new countries, WHO 20200404.7182744\nPoliomyelitis update (16): global (WPV1, cVDPV2) Philippines, Pakistan 20200216.6993599\nPoliomyelitis update (15): Pakistan (KP, SD) 20200209.6972016\nPoliomyelitis update (14): global (WPV1 Pakistan, cVDPV2 DRC, Angola) 20200209.6969379\nPoliomyelitis update (13): Pakistan (SD) 20200205.6958445\nPoliomyelitis update (12): global (WPV1,cVDPV) Pakistan (SD,BA,KP,PJ) 20200204.6950451\nPoliomyelitis update (11): Pakistan (KP) tribal districts 20200126.6919131\nPoliomyelitis update (10): global, Pakistan (BA, SD) 20200124.6911971\nPoliomyelitis update (09): Pakistan (KP) 1st WPV1 case in 2020, cVDPV2, RFI 20200120.6898946\nPoliomyelitis update (08): global (WPV, cVDPV) Philippines, Pakistan, violence 20200116.6891334\nPoliomyelitis update (07): Pakistan (KP) 20200114.6889725\nPoliomyelitis update (06): Pakistan (SD) 20200111.6884192\nPoliomyelitis update (05): Malaysia (SA) RFI 20200110.6883281\nPoliomyelitis update (04): Ghana (BO, BE, AF) RFI 20200110.6882389\nPoliomyelitis update (03): global (WPV1 Afghan., Pak., cVDPV2 Zambia), Pakistan 20200110.6881006\nPoliomyelitis update (02): Pakistan (KP, BA, SD) 20200105.6872314\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (WPV1, cVDPV2), Pakistan (KP, SD) 20200103.6869841\n2019\n---\nPoliomyelitis update (106): Pakistan (KP) RFI 20191231.6865382\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global 20190104.6241814\n2018\n---\nPoliomyelitis update (62): (Nigeria, Niger) cVDPV2 20181228.6226490\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (Afghanistan) 20180105.5539242\n2017\n---\nPoliomyelitis update (47): Pakistan, global (Congo DR) 20171229.5526565\nPoliomyelitis (01): Pakistan (GB), global, RFI 20170314.4898724\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................mpp/mj/sh", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8235917", "headline": "Yellow fever - Americas (04): Brazil (SC) monkey, susp", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8235917", "date": "2021-03-09 06:12:54", "main_text": "YELLOW FEVER - AMERICAS (04): BRAZIL (SANTA CATARINA) MONKEY, SUSPECTED\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 5 Mar 2021\nSource: Sul Agora [in Portuguese, trans.

However, the alert was made due to the increase in cases.\n\nAccording to the biologist Sabrina Fernandes Cardoso of the State Health Secretariat, the 1st results of the test are expected at the beginning of next week. \"It is worrisome because there is no apparent cause of death of these animals, with no signs of aggression or accident. In addition to this, the monkeys that were seen constantly by the residents have disappeared,\" she stated.\n\nThe alert has been issued because the appearance of dead monkeys in a given region could indicate the presence of the virus that causes yellow fever. When such an event is detected, the viscera of the animals is taken out and sent for testing in the laboratory in order to confirm, or not, the presence of this virus in these animals, which are considered to be sentinels.\n\n\"The entire locality is being mapped for vaccination coverage of the residents. Epidemiological surveillance teams are visiting house-by-house and orienting the residents. A point to underscore is the increase in vaccination against yellow fever, which is available in all the health posts,\" stated Sabrina, the biologist.\n\nMunicipal residents who by chance encounter a dead monkey are being instructed to go to the nearest health unit to report it. Then, the health team must note the data and communicate it to the Municipal Epidemiological Surveillance, which will take the necessary measures.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\n<promed-port@promedmail.org>\n\n[The possible (probable) confirmation of yellow fever among the non-human primates under investigation should not be a surprise.

The virus has already [spread] considerably. Over the past 2 years, we have noticed a lack of communication from companies, as they fear reporting the virus would lead to crops being uprooted,\" explained Professor Walter Davino [University of Palermo].\n\nCurrently, around 45% of companies with protected crops report infections. In Sicily, the problem manifested in 2018. According to Davino, \"no alert was made; no containment measure was implemented; there was no quick and effective detection method. In the meantime, however, we have set up [a] project to identify and track the virus starting from the nurseries.\"\n\nDario Cartabellotta, Regional Council for Agriculture, [said], \"Considering the significant danger of the virus reducing tomato production especially in greenhouses, the Department of Agriculture, with the Plant Protection Service [DA/PPS], [is] monitoring the disease and traces movements of infected seeds and plants. The situation will only get worse until resistant varieties are found. Prevention is the only weapon. The problem was tackled with mandatory phytosanitary measures. In early February 2021, the work was audited by the European Commission. A new national regulation will require additional and complex measures to be implemented.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was recently identified as a new member of the genus _Tobamovirus_ (type member _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan and soon after in Israel (see links below). Since then, it has also been reported from a number of other countries in Europe and the Mediterranean region, where it appears to be spreading, as well as from North America and China. It was shown to also affect capsicum and has been detected in both plants and seed of both crops. ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar, but they may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic, and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; and yellowish mottling, brown spots, and rugosis on fruit, making them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar; fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100% incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms.\n\nToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. It is very stable and can remain infectious for months outside a host. Recently, bumblebees, which are used widely as commercial pollinators in glasshouse tomato production, have been shown to be effective vectors of ToBRFV (see link below). Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial. Research on possible seed treatments to eliminate the virus is being carried out (see link below). Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED post 20140122.2222560).\n\nCoinfection of ToBRFV with _Pepino mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_) and _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (genus _Orthotospovirus_) have been found (ProMED posts 20191029.6751082, 20200507.7307615). It is thought that the observed symptoms on tomatoes may be due to either virus or to synergism. Further research is needed to clarify a potential role of ToBRFV in coinfections and to determine whether its presence in coinfections may have led to earlier cases of misdiagnosis and delayed identification of this new virus.\n\nMaps\nItaly:\nhttp://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_div96.jpg (with regions)\nEurope, overview:\nhttps://mapofeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/europe-political-map.jpg\n\nPictures\nToBRFV symptoms on tomato:\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/media/data/taxon/T/TOBRFV/pics/1024x0/4137.jpg,\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/media/data/taxon/T/TOBRFV/pics/1024x0/4138.jpg,\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170429.g001 and\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/321639141/figure/fig2/AS:569722670247937@1512843877331/Tomato-brown-rugose-fruit-virus-ToBRFV-infected-tomato-Solanum-lycopersicum-plants.png\n\nLinks\nAdditional news story:\nhttps://www.freshplaza.com/article/9293310/interview-with-virologist-walter-davino-on-the-tobrfv-situation/\nRecent updates from other European countries:\nhttps://www.hortidaily.com/article/9293779/uk-counted-5-tobrfv-outbreaks-in-2020/ (UK),\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/reporting/article-6956 (Belgium 1st rep, from Netherlands),\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/reporting/article-6957 (Spain),\nhttps://www.nieuweoogst.nl/nieuws/2020/09/28/vondst-van-tomatenvirus-in-duitsland (Germany, in Dutch) and\nhttps://www.hortweek.com/tomato-brown-rugose-fruit-virus-found-again-germany-uk-growers-discuss-issue/fresh-produce/article/1695354 (Germany, subscription)\nInformation and characterisation of ToBRFV:\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/taxon/TOBRFV (with distribution map),\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00705-015-2677-7 (Jordan),\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170429 (Israel),\nhttps://www.ndrs.org.uk/article.php?id=041020 (in capsicum) and via\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/topic/Tomato-brown-rugose-fruit-virus/3579397\nToBRFV spread by pollinators:\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210871\nTomato resistance breeding:\nhttps://www.hortidaily.com/article/9265808/we-can-eradicate-tobrfv-from-the-tomato-industry-with-our-newly-found-resistance/ and\nhttps://www.hortidaily.com/article/9272889/commercial-tomato-variety-with-tobrfv-resistance-to-be-offered-in-early-2021/\nToBRFV seed treatment:\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10658-020-02151-1\nInternational spread of tobamoviruses by seeds (review):\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/321639141_Seed_Transmission_of_Tobamoviruses_Aspects_of_Global_Disease_Distribution\nVirus taxonomy via:\nhttps://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/\n- Mod.DHA]\nSee Also\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - New Zealand: 1st rep 20210113.8100865\n2020\n---\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - Italy: (SC) 20201112.7936491\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - Africa: 1st rep (Egypt) 20200507.7307615\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - Spain: 1st rep (AN) 20200206.6959141\n2019\n---\nVirus double infection, tomato - Netherlands: (ZH) 20191029.6751082\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - China: 1st rep (SD) 20190903.6654138\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - UK, Turkey: 1st reps 20190722.6580891\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - Mexico: alert 20190429.6448297\nTomato brown rugose fruit virus - Germany: 1st rep (NW) 20190117.6264517\n2018\n---\nUndiagnosed leaf curl virus, tomato seed - Egypt 20181012.6086559\nand additional items on tobamoviruses in the archives\n.................................................sb/dha/msp/sh", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8235555", "headline": "Equine rhinopneumonitis - Spain (03): (VC) EHV-1, horse, intl spread, Italy", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8235555", "date": "2021-03-09 06:09:03", "main_text": "EQUINE RHINOPNEUMONITIS - SPAIN (03): (VALENCIA) EHV-1, HORSE, INTERNATIONAL SPREAD, ITALY\n******************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Epidemiologically related 2 outbreaks in Lombardia, Italy\n[2] EHV-1 Valencia event and transboundary ramifications - timetable\n\n******\n[1] Epidemiologically related 2 outbreaks in Lombardia, Italy\nDate: Mon 8 Mar 2021\nFrom: Andrea Carvelli <andrea.carvelli@yahoo.it> [edited]\n\n\nRe: Equine rhinopneumonitis - Spain (02): (VC) EHV-1, horse, intl spread 20210308.8233620\n\nEHV-1, Italy\n-----------\nIn Italy, after the outbreak in Valencia (Spain), 4 outbreaks of rhinopneumonitis have been notified, 3 in Lombardia region and one in the province of Trento. Two outbreaks (both in Lombardia) are epidemiologically linked to Valencia.\n\n--\nAndrea Carvelli\nIstituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana \"M. Aleandri\"\n<andrea.carvelli@yahoo.it>\n\n[We are grateful to Dr Carvelli for the above timely update; Italy becomes the 7th country suffering EHV-1 infections in horses related to the event in Valencia, which -- as indicated in 20210308.8233620 -- include Spain, Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Qatar.\n\nFor subscribers' convenience, we present (item 2) FEI's timetable of this concerning event since its reported start on 20 Feb 2021 and as of 8 Mar 2021, which already includes preliminary data on the spread to Italy. - Mod.AS]\n\n******\n[2] EHV-1 Valencia event and transboundary ramifications - timetable\n\nDate: Mon 8 Mar 2021 [accessed]\nFEI (International Equestrian Federation) website, EHV-1 - timeline [edited]\nhttps://inside.fei.org/fei/ehv-1/timeline\n\n\nTimeline\n--------\n1. 20 Feb 2021:\n1st notification of sick horses: The FEI Veterinary Department was informed by the onsite FEI veterinary delegate in the afternoon of 20 Feb 2021 that 11 horses had fever at the CES Valencia Spring Tour (ESP) [meanings of abbreviations unclear. - Mod.SH]. Later the same day, the number had increased to 20.\n\nThe FEI was also advised of 4 cases of suspected equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) in horses that had left the venue on 14 Feb 2021 and became sick shortly after returning to their home country (France). At least one of these horses was showing neurological signs.\n\nWith this combined information, the FEI concluded that this was an outbreak of the neurological form of EHV-1 and immediately told organisers and onsite officials to cancel the rest of the event in Valencia.\n\nThe FEI informed the organisers of the other tours on the Iberian Peninsula of the situation and instructed them not to accept any horses that had been competing at Valencia.\n\n2. 21 Feb 2021:\nThe FEI followed up with the OC [organising committee? - Mod.SH] treating veterinarians on the situation with horses in Valencia, and this was then continued on a daily basis.\n\nThe FEI veterinary delegate and venue veterinary services manager remained on venue to treat horses, where necessary, and implement a mitigation plan for containing the outbreak in accordance with the FEI Veterinary Regulations.\n\nWith the information available, the FEI established that there was potential disease transmission between horses that had been at the venue in the period between 1 and 20 Feb 2021.\n\nThe FEI commenced identification of the more than 700 in-contact horses that had participated at Valencia since 1 Feb 2021.\n\n3. 22 Feb 2021:\nLocal authorities took over venue: the regional branch of the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA) formally took over the Valencia venue.\n\nTracing & blocking of in-contact horses: Within less than 48 hours of being informed of the outbreak, the FEI traced and blocked in the FEI Database all 752 horses that had participated in Valencia, meaning that these horses are not permitted to enter any FEI events until they have fulfilled the necessary testing requirements.\n\nThe FEI confirmed the identification of the Valencia horses to the organisers of the other tours on the Iberian Peninsula, and instructed them not to accept these horses.\n\nAll athletes that had participated with horses in Valencia since 1 Feb 2021 received a communique outlining the FEI measures blocking the in-contact horses and the actions that they personally needed to take to help prevent the further spread of this virus.\n\n3. 23 Feb 2021:\nThe FEI contacted the national federations (NFs) of athletes who had left the venue with their horses without the necessary health certificates and asked these NFs to contact their national veterinary authority.\n\nThe FEI contacted the organisers of events in other parts of Europe with lists of horses and athletes that had been in Valencia.\n\nExpert support: the FEI initiated a series of regular meetings (ongoing) with world leading epidemiologists to conduct a full risk assessment of the further spread of the outbreak.\n\nThe FEI followed up on test results from venue horses in Valencia.\n\n4. 24 Feb 2021:\nOfficial notification by Spanish Authorities: the Secretariat of Sanidad e Higiene Animal y Trazabilidad (the regional branch of MAPA) published an official notification of the EHV-1 outbreak \"Confirmacion Rinoneumonitis equina en concurso hipico en Valencia\".\n\nThe FEI continued to follow up with event organisers to ensure that no in-contact horses from Valencia were onsite at their venues and, if they were, that they were in isolation and under strict biosecurity measures.\n\nFollowing discussions with the FEI, the Spanish Equestrian Federation was in direct contact with the Spanish Ministry to ensure that a team of FEI supporting veterinarians would be allowed onsite in Valencia to supplement the OC treating veterinarians already onsite.\n\nThe FEI monitored the health situation of horses on all jumping tours on the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n5. 25 Feb 2021:\nUrgent request for help: The FEI was alerted by athletes in Valencia that conditions onsite had deteriorated, and they needed urgent assistance, including pharmaceuticals for the sick horses.\n\nThe FEI requested the Spanish National Federation to contact the Ministry for information on treatment protocols for sick horses and plans for release of healthy horses. The Spanish Federation provided immediate help.\n\nThe FEI contacted DG Sante of the European Commission to update them and request support with Ministry contacts in Spain.\n\n6. 26 Feb 2021:\n1st recorded death: The FEI was advised that a horse had been euthanised at the veterinary hospital in Valencia due to EHV-1 that evening.\n\nOf the 150 horses still on the venue, a total of 72 horses showed clinical signs of EHV-1. Of the 47 horses that had been tested, 17 were confirmed positive for the virus.\n\nThe FEI requested and received agreement from the Spanish regional veterinary authorities to allow 5 additional veterinarians onsite to treat the affected horses. As soon as we received the necessary approval, the FEI entered discussion with the Spanish, French and German National Federations on the provision of additional veterinarians to Valencia.\n\nThe FEI also requested a detailed plan from the regional veterinary authorities on the treatment of sick horses, management of the outbreak, and the plan for getting healthy horses off the venue.\n\nThree horses were transferred to the veterinary hospital with neurological symptoms, but one was recovering well and was expected to return to the venue.\n\nThe FEI also received information that there may be additional numbers of horses displaying neurological signs but did not have confirmation at that stage.\n\nThe FEI was informed of 2 possible further outbreaks in Belgium that traced back to Valencia.\n\n7. 27 Feb 2021:\nConfirmation was received by the FEI of a 2nd related equine fatality, also at the Valencia veterinary hospital.\n\nArrival of veterinary support: The Spanish national head veterinarian, together with the assigned leader of the FEI veterinary support team, arrived onsite.\n\nIt was arranged for FEI veterinary manager Goncalo Paixao to travel to Valencia the following day to establish improved lines of communication between the authorities, the Valencia organisers and athletes.\n\nThe FEI veterinary director updated European Equestrian Federation president Theo Ploegmakers on the outbreak.\n\nA horse in Villamoura (POR) died suddenly of a suspected circulatory collapse. As a precaution, the FEI ordered urgent PCR testing which came back negative for EHV-1.\n\n8. 28 Feb 2021:\nInformation was received by the FEI that 2 horses had been euthanised on-venue in Valencia, bringing the number of related deaths to 4.\n\nThe FEI was informed of outbreaks in Germany that traced back to Valencia.\n\nBoosted onsite support: two veterinarians, organised by the German National Federation, arrived onsite in Valencia to assist with treating the sick horses.\n\nThe French National Federation and the FEI coordinated a supply of inflatable support mats to assist recumbent horses to stand. Rescue nets and emergency slings were sourced from Switzerland.\n\nThe FEI sourced extra stabling so that healthy/recovered horses in Valencia could be better separated from sick animals on venue to prevent further transmission. These were to be divided between the venue and the Valencia Equine Hospital in order to free up emergency treatment permanent stables.\n\nThe FEI again directly contacted National Federations with horses that participated in Valencia requesting confirmation that they had contacted all their athletes that were in Valencia, that their national veterinary authorities had been informed about the outbreak and the returning horses, and that the necessary isolation of returning horses and in-contact horses had been put in place and compliance is being controlled.\n\n9. 1 Mar 2021:\nFEI cancelled events in mainland Europe: following a detailed risk assessment conducted together with leading epidemiologist Richard Newton, the FEI cancelled international events in 10 countries on the European mainland with immediate effect and until 28 Mar 2021 due to the rapid evolution of the EHV-1 outbreak.\n\nThe decision covers events in France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Poland, Netherlands, Germany and Slovakia.\n\nThe decision applies to all FEI disciplines, but in order to prevent huge numbers of horses simultaneously departing the Jumping Tours on the Iberian Peninsula, in Italy and Belgium that have been ongoing for a number of weeks, these specific Tours will be allowed to continue as individual \"bubbles\" on the condition that absolutely no new horses are allowed to enter the venues and no positive cases of EHV-1 are confirmed.\n\nThe Jumping Tour venues in Vejer de la Frontera (ESP), Vilamoura (POR), San Giovanni in Marignano (ITA) and Gorla Minore (ITA) were required to have stringent biosecurity protocols in place and additional FEI Veterinary Delegates onsite, put in place with the assistance of the Spanish and Italian national head veterinarians.\n\nOliva Nova (ESP) had already advised the FEI the same afternoon that it had decided to cancel the rest of its scheduled competitions in the Mediterranean Equestrian Tour III. Opglabbeek (BEL) also informed the FEI that it had cancelled its events in March 2021.\n\nThe French National Federation confirmed it had cancelled all national and international events.\n\nThe FEI strongly recommended that all affected member Federations should also cancel their national events.\n\nThe FEI received notification on the evening of 1 Mar 2021 that one of 4 horses that had travelled from Valencia to Doha (QAT) was showing clinical signs in the isolation stables and had tested positive for EHV-1. The horse was transferred to the isolation unit of the neighbouring veterinary clinic, together with a 2nd German horse that returned an inconclusive result and required retesting.\n\nThe FEI continued to collate further information about related outbreaks and the measures put in place at local level to handle any outbreaks.\n\n10. 2 Mar 2021:\nThe German and Czech Equestrian Federations cancelled all events until 28 Mar 2021.\n\nRisk assessment for Doha: In order to fully assess whether the GCT/GCL event would be permitted to go ahead in Doha, the FEI Veterinary Department conducted a full risk assessment to evaluate the biosecurity measures already in place on-venue, focusing on the potential risk of viral transmission to healthy horses. As the 4 horses that had travelled from Valencia had been in isolation since 22 Feb 2021, it was agreed to wait for the results of the PCR tests on all other horses on the venue, which were completely separated from the positive horse.\n\nA veterinary internal medicine specialist, sent by the French National Federation, arrived onsite in Valencia.\n\nThe organisers of San Giovanni in Marignano (ITA) advised the FEI that they had cancelled their Jumping Tour.\n\nThe FEI continued its follow up with national federations and organising committees to evaluate their preventive measures and protocols in place for handling outbreaks.\n\n11. 3 Mar 2021:\nThere had been no more equine fatalities at the venue in Valencia since the previous weekend, but one horse died at a veterinary hospital in Barcelona, and one died in Germany. Both of these horses had been in Valencia. There were no reports of any further related deaths, but this brought the total number of deaths in the outbreak to 6.\n\nA total of 83 on-venue horses in Valencia showed clinical signs and were being treated, but none of these horses were recumbent or required slings for support.\n\nFifteen horses were being treated in external clinics (13 in Valencia and 2 in Barcelona).\n\nImproved communications: the FEI veterinary manager organised an onsite meeting in Valencia between Spanish ministry officials (MAPA), the organisers, the OC veterinarians, an athlete representative, and the FEI treatment team leader to help resolve issues. Agreement was reached on roles, treatment protocols, and a new plan for separation of horses following requests from athletes and owners for their horses to be grouped together without infringing biosecurity protocols.\n\nCarl-Walter Fox (SWE), the athlete representative in Valencia, who had been in constant contact with the FEI veterinary director since the start of the outbreak, initiated more detailed daily reports.\n\nSome of the additional temporary stabling delivered to the venue was not up to standard, and all of it was unsuitable for large horses. Replacement boxes were organised.\n\nThe FEI received early morning confirmation that all competing horses in Doha had tested negative for EHV-1. The FEI veterinary director met with the Doha [Qatar] organisers and senior FEI officials onsite at Al Shaqab to further assess the situation.\n\nDoha given conditional go-ahead: following further consultation with leading epidemiologist Dr Gittan Groendahl about the situation in Doha, the FEI agreed that competition could go ahead as scheduled from 4-6 Mar 2021 subject to a series of stringent conditions. However, the FEI reserved the right to cancel the event if there were any changes to the situation.\n\nThe conditions for continuation included maintaining strict isolation protocols for the 4 Valencia horses; twice-daily temperature checks for all competing horses; minimising all contact between horses; treatment boxes to be closed, and treating/testing of horses permitted in the horse's own stable under supervision of an FEI official; daily calls between the FEI, the organisers, relevant onsite FEI officials, and athlete representative Kevin Staut. The conditions also included confirmation from the organisers that no sanctions would be applied against individual athletes or teams if they chose not to compete.\n\nA case of EHV-1 (neurological form) was reported in Ocala, Florida (USA), similar in nature, but unrelated to the neurological strain of EHV-1 in Spain and other European countries. The horse had not been shipped from Europe and was not on the Ocala showgrounds at the onset of symptoms. The event in Ocala was not an FEI event; however, after consultation with the FEI Veterinary Department, additional onsite biosecurity measures were implemented in Wellington, Florida, by the FEI veterinary delegate.\n\n12. 4 Mar 2021:\nThe FEI was informed of 2 related equine deaths, one in Germany and one in Barcelona, bringing the official and confirmed number of deaths in the outbreak to 8.\n\nThe Swedish Federation advised the FEI that a number of horses returning to Sweden from Valencia had tested positive for EHV-1 and were showing clinical signs.\n\nSuspected neurological case at Sunshine Tour: The FEI was informed by the team leader of the 3 additional FEI veterinary delegates at the Spanish Sunshine Tour venue in Vejer de la Frontera (ESP) that a horse had developed neurological signs of EHV-1, although it had reportedly tested negative to the virus. The horse had been in isolation 2 km from the competition since 26 Feb 2021.\n\nConditional go-ahead: following a full risk analysis conducted by the Spanish Ministry (MAPA), the Spanish National Federation, the organisers, FEI officials, the jumping athlete representative, and the FEI, all parties agreed that -- exceptionally, and in order to ensure an orderly and bio-secure departure of horses -- competition could continue until Sun 7 Mar 2021 subject to a number of strict conditions.\n\nThe conditions for continuation included the implementation of additional biosecurity measures and that any horses departing the venue had to have the required health certification. In order to prevent horses leaving without the necessary documentation, athletes were advised that sanctions could be enforced by their national veterinary authorities and the FEI. The local authorities agreed to bring in additional personnel to expedite issuing of health certificates. However, the FEI reserved the right to cancel the full event if the situation changed.\n\nThe FEI veterinary director liaised directly with the Belgian National Federation and team veterinarian on the treatment of their horse in the isolation stables at Vejer.\n\nThe FEI jumping director arrived onsite in Valencia and held a meeting with the organisers to resolve a number of issues. He then called a follow-up meeting between all parties to ensure the lines of communication remained open.\n\nThe athlete representative onsite in Valencia reported that Covid-19 testing had been put in place on the venue.\n\nThe competent veterinary authorities of France, Germany and the Netherlands were working on creating bio-secure highways to get sick or in-contact horses home from Spain and Portugal, having secured the necessary permissions from Spanish authorities.\n\n12. 5 Mar 2021:\nThe FEI was notified of another equine fatality at the clinic in Valencia, bringing the number of related deaths in the outbreak to 9.\n\nCancellation of Spanish Sunshine Tour: the FEI was informed in the afternoon by the team leader of the 3 additional FEI veterinary delegates that a 2nd horse at the Spanish Sunshine Tour venue had been put into isolation after developing mild neurological signs and a slightly elevated temperature. As the FEI had also received evidence late that afternoon from the official laboratory in Madrid that the negative test on the 1st horse showing neurological signs in Vejer was inconclusive, the FEI arranged a meeting with the organisers and onsite FEI officials. After a follow-up emergency internal meeting, the FEI informed the organisers that the event was cancelled with immediate effect. The FEI again stressed that horses should not leave the venue without the necessary documentation from the Spanish authorities.\n\nStopover stabling for returning horses: The French Federation (FFE) established transit stabling in Le Mans and Lyons for horses travelling back from Spain, Portugal and Italy. The FFE, together with the FEI, arranged for 24-hour veterinary support in Le Mans and is working to provide the same service in Lyons. Places should be booked as soon as possible. More information on these stabling options and potentially additional locations in France will be updated here.\n\nThe athlete representative in Valencia reported to the FEI veterinary director that supplies were continuing to be delivered to the venue and that new stabling would be arriving onsite the following day. There was also a plan put in place, approved by the veterinary team, on where and how to exercise the healthy horses. The onsite veterinary team reported that the sick horses are improving.\n\nEEF support: the European Equestrian Federation (EEF) provided its members with the guidelines of the European College of Equine Internal Medicine (ECEIM) for dealing with returning horses from EHV-1 outbreaks and also the British Equestrian Federation biosecurity protocol.\n\nThe EEF contracted Dutch veterinarian and EHV expert Prof Dr Marianne Sloet to provide guidance to the EEF and its member federations and encouraged those in urgent need of veterinary advice to contact the EEF.\n\nThe FEI formally addressed the Veterinary Authority of Qatar about its concerns about the 4 horses that had been in Valencia and advised that, as agreed with the Doha organisers, these horses must be transported back to Europe separately from the competing horses.\n\nThe Swedish National Federation confirmed that it had cancelled all national events.\n\n13. 6 Mar 2021:\nFEEVA support: The FEI, supported by the Federation of European Equine Veterinary Associations (FEEVA), formally addressed the Secretariat of Sanidad e Higiene Animal y Trazabilidad (the regional branch of MAPA) proposing improved protocols for allowing in-contact horses to leave the venue in Valencia.\n\nImprovements in Valencia: the athlete representative in Valencia reported that the daily onsite information meeting was well attended. The medical condition of the horses remains stable with less serious cases reported. While these were positive signs, the veterinary team stressed that it is important to be aware that the disease was yet not fully under control.\n\nExtra grooms are being made available for teams requiring support to look after their horses. Additional truck drivers are being sought to help in transporting the horses home from Valencia.\n\nA French team specializing in international quarantine stables provided recommendations on good biosecurity practice, including washing and disinfection of trucks and equipment to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nAccess to the individual zones in the Valencia stabling was further strengthened with the use of bracelets in order to prevent movement between different zones. A French team has provided an onsite PCR lab to help with monitoring sick horses, allowing a faster detection of the movement of the virus between horses and establish whether there is a pattern.\n\nNew stabling arrived on venue, allowing the horses to be divided into smaller groups. Additional stables are available in the area and can be installed immediately if required.\n\nThe Veterinary Authority of Qatar confirmed that the 4 in-contact horses that had been in Valencia and were still in isolation in Doha would not be flying home to Europe from Qatar with the other horses and would be remaining in isolation until at least 15 Mar 2021.\n\nThe FEI continued to address the Spanish Sunshine Tour Organisers about allowing additional veterinary delegates onsite to support the biosecurity measures on the venue and treatment of the affected horses in the isolation stables.\n\nThe FEI, supported by FEEVA and the Asociacion de Veterinarios Especialistas en Equidos (the Spanish branch of FEEVA), provided assistance to 2 individual athletes and their veterinarians to ensure that the 2 horses with neurological signs in the Vejer de la Frontera isolation stables would be allowed into specialist treatment clinics.\n\nThe FEI received official notification that a 2nd horse in Florida (USA) had been confirmed positive to EHV-1. The horse had a fever but was not exhibiting any neurological signs. The Florida Department of Agriculture published on its website that the 1st horse was housed at the World Equestrian Center Barn D during week 7 and the 2nd horse was housed in Barn D during week 8. The 2nd horse left the World Equestrian Center on 25 Feb 2021. The Department update confirmed that 67 other horses had been exposed.\n\n14. 7 Mar 2021:\nThe International Jumping Riders Club (IJRC) published information for those with horses travelling back from Spain, reminding members of the importance of cleaning and disinfection of stables prior to departure, and of transport vehicles, to minimise the risk of further transmission of the virus. The club listed transit stabling options in addition to the 2 stops in Le Mans and Lyons organised by the FFE. Details are available on the IJRC website.\n\nThe FEI continued to follow up on the condition and veterinary care of the 2 horses that had developed neurological signs in Vejer de la Frontera.\n\nThe FEI veterinary director requested an update from the primary veterinary delegate on the remaining horses on venue\nThe athlete representative in Valencia reported a very smooth daily meeting, where the onsite veterinary team distributed a short-term rehabilitation plan for the horses over the next 7 days. The consignment of extra stabling organised by Katharina Offel is now onsite, and 18 of these boxes have been provided to the Hospital Veterinario CEU clinic, which is treating the horses.\n\n15. 8 Mar 2021:\nThe FEI was notified that a horse had been euthanised at the clinic in Valencia, bringing the number of related deaths to 10.\n\nThe FEI was notified of a related case of EHV-1 in Milan (ITA).\n\nThe organisers of the Jumping Tour in Gorla Minore (ITA) advised the FEI of the cancellation of the remaining 3 weeks of competition. This was done due to low entry numbers.

The USA's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak could have informed its COVID-19 response. Lancet Online First. Published: 5 Mar 2021\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDespite multiple warnings and the inevitability of infectious disease outbreaks, preparedness has [not received due priority] in the USA. From severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 to Ebola in 2014, the USA has confronted many outbreaks -- each should have served as a wake-up call to the importance of preparedness, knowing that these were not one-off events but part of a looming trend. Since their creation 15 years ago, the International Health Regulations of 2005 have been used 5 times to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\n\nPreparedness is, by definition, proactive. Yet the way we often respond to outbreaks is reactive. To reap its remarkable dividends, preparedness must remain an active and ongoing commitment. Investments in preparedness will strengthen health care systems and better protect health care workers all across the globe. Emerging infectious diseases do not respect borders, making it critical that such preparedness happens in unison, with coordination among national and international partners.\n\nYet, as we have learned with COVID-19, preparedness alone is not enough. During outbreaks, public health experts must be given the platform to provide politicians and the public alike access to prompt and accurate information. As a global community, we must recognise that our response to such outbreaks must be global--no country or community is safe until we are all safe. Outbreaks are inevitable, and it is essential that we recognise these fundamental truths about the role and importance of preparedness before we confront the next pandemic.\n\nThere are also clear financial benefits to prioritising preparedness. Since October, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has an interim economic price tag of USD 16 trillion in the USA (1). Had the USA invested just an additional USD 5 per person annually in preparedness (2), both domestically (USD 1.65 billion) and internationally (USD 39 billion), it would have taken 970 years to spend as much on investing in global preparedness as the USA is spending in response to COVID-19.\n\nThere are foundational elements in epidemic preparedness that should have been gleaned from the USA's previous outbreak responses and subsequently applied to all future health threats, including COVID-19. 5 lessons learned from the USA's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak should have informed the country's COVID-19 response, given its roles in responding to both epidemics previously and currently.\n\nFirst, infectious disease outbreaks expose the shortcomings in healthcare systems. The Ebola outbreak pointed to gaps in training and resources as not all US hospitals were ready and equipped to manage a patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola. With COVID-19, all 6090 US hospitals became battlegrounds. Given that pandemic preparedness has not been part of routine health care delivery, nor has there been an incentive to build a better infrastructure, there must be specific federal funding allocated that is sustained in perpetuity to ensure biopreparedness. A return to pre-pandemic normal is what got us here in the first place. Americans must invest in long-term solutions, build back better, invest in preparedness, and sustain the gains. Regardless of the cost, this investment will pay massive dividends during the next pandemic.\n\nSecond, health care worker safety must be prioritised. Protecting the health care workforce should always be a top priority. Simply put, there is no patient care without providers. Health care facilities that were caring for patients with Ebola had a provider-centred approach, containing the virus within a dedicated unit and with a limited number of health care personnel as part of the care team. With COVID-19, nearly every provider is on the front line and must be supported, and the strategy must be shifted from containment to community risk mitigation. Health care worker safety goes beyond just physical safety. It must also encompass psychological and mental health support.\n\nThird, a coherent national plan is vital to combat a pandemic, and collaboration with national and international partners, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Agency for International Development, and WHO -- all of whom collaborated at the forefront of the fight against Ebola in 2014 -- is necessary. That collaboration was 2-fold: to work together in mitigation and containment of the contagion, and to share knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned that would better inform processes, public health guidance, and health-care responses. Responding to pandemics by prioritising nationalistic tendencies over global goodwill is doubly damaging -- it undermines the USA's important leadership role in global health, but also makes the USA less safe for Americans.\n\nFourth, health experts must be placed at the forefront to educate the public. Science and risk communication during a public health crisis is crucial. With every epidemic comes the contagion of misinformation. Health experts, such as those in public health and health-care services have a central role in addressing misconceptions, risk behaviours, preventive measures, and providing the latest science-based information. Although the risk of Ebola transmission within the community in the USA was low in 2014-16, the public perceived the threat as much greater (3), requiring a coherent, one-voice approach from the federal government to better inform the public. COVID-19 is, however, a substantial public health threat with ongoing community transmission in the USA. Sharing conflicting information and largely politicizing the pandemic has led to greater loss of trust in science and life-saving public health measures with constant undermining of public health professionals.\n\nFinally, training and hands-on experience are critical. During the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, academic (medical and public health) institutions across the world contributed faculty and staff to aid the response. This global assistance was crucial to ending the outbreak and provided unparalleled real-world and hands-on experience to thousands of health professionals who would subsequently use those skills to lead future responses at home and abroad. Although case studies and simulated exercises are helpful didactic tools in preparedness and response, they do not reliably mimic the on-the-ground complexity of response activities during a disease outbreak.\n\nCompared with their counterparts across the globe, the academic institutions and public health schools in the USA were more restrictive and less likely to send faculty and staff, often for logistic or legal reasons. This situation meant that the USA had fewer front-line providers with real-life experience in a rapidly changing disease outbreak. Had more Ebola-experienced providers been on the front lines during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we would have responded better, faster, and more efficiently.\n\nReferences\n---------\n1.

The assistance will support disease surveillance, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, contact tracing, community awareness and social mobilization, and logistics management.\n\nOn 7 Feb 2021, the Ministry of Health in the DRC confirmed an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu Province. Separately, on 14 Feb 2021, the Guinean Ministry of Health also confirmed an Ebola outbreak. At this time, DRC reports 11 confirmed cases including four deaths and Guinea reports 173 confirmed and probable cases including eight deaths. The US assistance will complement the ongoing response efforts of the governments of DRC and Guinea.\n\nUSAID is working closely with other US departments and agencies, US embassies, the ministries of health in Guinea, the DRC, and neighboring countries, WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, the Africa CDC, and other multilateral and bilateral partners to ensure efforts are well integrated and aligned with each country's Ebola response plan. Ending these Ebola outbreaks is a priority for the United States. USAID is committed to helping affected communities control outbreaks quickly and effectively. Swift outbreak control will help prevent the spread to other countries.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2020, the US government was the largest bilateral donor to respond to multiple Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and the DRC. The US Government's coordinated, whole-of-government response to the current Ebola outbreaks incorporates lessons learned from past outbreaks, including best practices to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse in response efforts. Affected countries, the United States, and the world are more prepared to cope with infectious disease outbreaks -- including COVID-19 and Ebola -- due to ongoing investments to improve global health security across the region.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[This is great news.

This is not surprising, he said, pointing out that \"Ebola is a disease that scares people. It is a dramatic disease that kills a lot.\"\n\nEbola, which is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. Death rates are high, at around 50 per cent on average of those infected, and up to 90 per cent for some epidemics, WHO data show.\n\nGuinea recorded new Ebola cases on 13 Feb [2021] near the town of Goueke, in the south eastern Nzerekore region, and declared an epidemic shortly after. To date, 18 cases have been reported, 14 of which have been confirmed to be Ebola, including 4 people who have died, WHO said on Friday [5 Mar 2021]. These mark the 1st Ebola cases to surface in West Africa since a devastating 2013-2016 epidemic that left more than 11 300 dead in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.\n\n\"There is a lot of anxiety naturally for the comeback of this disease,\" Capobianco said. \"We do have a lot of trauma,\" he said, adding that in some cases this \"actually manifests in some resistance.\" During the last epidemic, communities across West Africa, but particularly in Guinea, revolted when outsiders in hazmat suits initially arrived to help halt the spread. In 2014, 8 members of an outreach team in the southeastern town of Womey -- just 50 kilometres [31 mi] from the current epicentre in Nzerekore -- were killed by protesters.\n\nThe resistance sparked a shift in the response, with more efforts made to engage communities and seek assistance from traditional and religious leaders in explaining the disease and the necessity of the measures taken. And IFRC, which is deeply involved in many aspects of the response, helped develop an approach to burying people possibly carrying Ebola safely while still respecting traditions as far as possible.\n\nPeople infected with Ebola are at their most contagious right after death, making traditional funeral practices that often include washing, touching, and kissing dead bodies dangerous. The current outbreak in Guinea, for instance, began when several people were infected at the funeral of a 51 year old nurse, who was the 1st known case.\n\nBut Capobianco said IFRC were running into resistance when seeking to conduct so-called safe and dignified burials of anyone who dies in communities where Ebola is spreading. Such burials \"have a massive impact in terms of reducing transmission\", he said, adding though that \"we have not always been able to perform (them) because the community simply refused to have the burials performed by the Red Cross teams.\"\n\nWhile this was worrying, Capobianco stressed that the resistance was \"a problem that can be solved. It can be solved by listening to the communities, by reflecting on their fears, by explaining what this disease is, and by showing that actually people are not condemned to death by having Ebola,\" he said. Those battling Ebola in Guinea today had tools not available during the last epidemic, including vaccines and therapeutics driving down the fatality rate, he said.\n\nMore than 1600 people, including contacts of cases, their contacts, and health workers have been vaccinated so far, according to WHO. Capobianco said the 1st IFRC health workers received their jabs on Friday [5 Mar 2021]. \"This time we have tools that are very powerful that we can deploy,\" he said. \"As long as we can win the communities over and ensure they are part of the response, we should be able to bring this under control.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Community outreach is essential to combating Ebola and other diseases, educating and engaging members of the community in the effort to control spread. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[5] Nigeria: alert\nDate: Sat 6 Mar 2021\nSource: Leadership [edited]\nhttps://leadership.ng/ncdcs-alert-on-ebola/amp\n\n\nThe Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recently disclosed that the country is at moderate risk of experiencing an Ebola outbreak. The Centre also said that Nigeria is in such a situation due to her proximity to Guinea after an outbreak was declared in that West African country on 14 Feb 2021. According to the NCDC, many cases and deaths were reported in the Nzerekore region of the country. At this time Nigeria is still battling with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe recall that the dreaded Ebola virus was introduced into Nigeria on 20 Jul 2014 when an infected Liberian arrived by air in Lagos. He died in a Lagos hospital 5 days later, and set off a chain of transmission that infected a total of 19 people of whom 7 died including the doctor who diagnosed him [with] the disease.\n\nAccording to WHO recommendations, the end of an Ebola virus disease outbreak in a country can be declared if no new cases [have been reported for] 42 days. The 42 days represents twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola (21 days). This 42 day period starts from the last day that any person in the country had contact with a confirmed or probable Ebola case. Consequently, on 20 Oct 2014, Nigeria reached that 42 day mark and was considered free of Ebola transmission.\n\nHowever, since February last year [2020], the country has been battling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Like everywhere else around the world, it has impacted negatively on the economic and social life. As at [4 Mar 2021], Nigeria had 156 960 coronavirus cases, 1939 deaths, and 135 812 recoveries. In the considered opinion of this newspaper, Nigeria cannot afford to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and Ebola at the same time. It will, without doubt, be a very dangerous combination with unimaginable negative impact that may lead to a total collapse of the nation's health system. Sadly, most health challenges have been relegated to the background since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Ebola cannot be joined in the mix and that is why we cannot afford to treat the NCDC warning about the disease with levity.\n\nTo be sure, Ebola virus, officially called _Zaire ebolavirus_ (EBOV) [infection], is an infectious disease that can affect both humans and animals. The disease is rare but very severe and potentially lethal. In Africa, more than half of the infected do not survive. After being infected with the virus, the 1st symptoms occur within 2-21 days. Usually, the 1st signs occur within a week. Ebola often starts with symptoms of severe flu or malaria: diarrhoea, fatigue, vomiting, muscle pain and headache.\n\nAlso, the Ebola virus attacks the immune system, once infected, the virus spreads and multiplies at lightning speed. It causes bleeding in various places in the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. It can be transmitted through body fluids. The Ebola virus is transferable through direct contact with (any kind of) body fluids, such as blood, saliva, or faeces. To prevent further spreading of the virus, it is important to avoid any kind of direct body contact with patients. Rapid patient isolation is, therefore, necessary and essential. The virus does not spread through the air or mosquitos. Ebola is still very difficult to battle: no specific cure or medical treatment is available yet. New treatment methods and the use of vaccinations are currently still in the experimental phase and therefore not yet available to everyone. In view of the foregoing, we call on the federal government to increase surveillance at the nation's international airports and land borders with heavy traffic.\n\nIt is gratifying to note that the NCDC has laid out plans to forestall the Ebola outbreak in the country. Already, the Centre claims \"Several measures have been put in place to prevent and mitigate the impact of a potential EVD outbreak in Nigeria. A National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) operating from NCDC's Incident Coordination Centre (ICC) is on alert mode. We have a team of first responders on standby, ready to be deployed within 24 hours in the event of an EVD outbreak in Nigeria. We have also established testing capacity for EVD at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory. The NCDC will continue working with states to strengthen preparedness activities across the country.\"\n\nIn our opinion, these measures by NCDC are proactive enough and will need to be sustained. What is required at this time, in our view, is intensive public enlightenment campaign to educate the populace to be on the lookout for any possible index case.

Urrego has no proof, but he suspects the culprit is pesticides which have been fueling a commercial avocado and citrus boom in the country.\n\nHundreds of hives have been killed off in Colombia in recent years, and some investigations have pointed to fipronil, an insecticide banned for use on crops in Europe and restricted in the United States and China. It is used to control all manner of insects, including ants and ticks, and has been blamed for several bee massacres around the world.\n\nUrrego's apiary in Colombia's Antioquia Department produces honey flavored with pollen from nearby passion fruit orchards. In 2019, he lost 10 of his 19 hives. This time, he said, a third of his 12 hives were wiped out--a loss of some 160 000 of the industrious little pollinators. \"There is a theory that, yes, this is due to poisoning, there are some crops around here that perhaps have not managed their agrochemicals well and so this area was affected,\" he told AFP.\n\nIn recent years, bees in North America, Europe, Russia, South America and elsewhere have started dying off from \"colony collapse disorder\", a mysterious scourge blamed partly on pesticides along with mites, viruses and fungi. The UN warns that nearly half of insect pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, risk global extinction. About 1.4 billion jobs and three quarters of all crops around the world, according to a 2016 study, depend on pollinators, mainly bees, which provide free fertilization services worth billions of dollars.\n\nSome 300 km (186 mi) south of Antioquia, in the Quindio Department, Abdon Salazar has no qualms pointing the finger at fipronil as he counts his losses. \"Over the last 2 years, we have calculated more than 80 million dead bees,\" he said as he walked among the 300 vibrating hives of his business Apicola Oro (Golden Beekeeping). \"We are talking some 800 hives, 100 000 bees per hive, it is a very large quantity, an alarming quantity.\"\n\nSalazar and other beekeepers in the region are increasingly having to clear out mounds of dead bees from their apiaries which are surrounded by avocado and citrus plantations in an exceptionally fertile and biodiverse part of the world.\n\nIn Quindio, hive collapse has coincided with the expansion of monoculture in recent decades, according to Faber Sabogal, president of the Asoproabejas beekeepers' organization.\n\nAccording to the local government, 5 multinational companies bought large tracts of land in the region between 2016 and 2019 to profit from the growing global appetite for Hass avocados. Exports skyrocketed from 1.7 tons in 2014 to 44.5 tons in 2019, and this year, Colombia became the largest supplier of the creamy, green delicacy to Europe.\n\nBut bees are the collateral damage, becoming contaminated as they buzz through pesticide-treated plantations looking for food, say beekeepers. \"They bring this poison to the hive and kill everyone else,\" said Salazar. Asoproabejas members have videotaped dozens of mass bee die-offs in several regions of Colombia, mainly in the west.\n\nLast year [2020], the state-owned Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) was notified by beekeepers of 256 suspected hive poisonings in Quindio alone. ICA regional manager Jorge Garcia said the body examined samples from 6 apiaries and found that \"the fipronil molecule is one of the causes of mortality.\" The alert was raised with ICA headquarters in Bogota, which is working on a suspension order, he told AFP. Withdrawing the poison altogether has been difficult \"because the companies producing agrochemicals will be affected economically,\" said Salazar.\n\nMaria Latorre, spokeswoman for Colombia's agrochemical union, said a fipronil ban would provoke \"a very negative situation for the productive structure\" of the 33 crops that rely on it. The body denies that fipronil is harmful to bees, but said it would welcome a \"review\" of its use \"on crops that have had incidents.\"\n\nBut Fernando Montoya of the Colombian Hortofruticola Association, which represents crop growers, said the chemical could be replaced by \"mushroom-based bioproducts,\" insect traps and manual pest removal.\n\nThe ICA has denied any link between the expansion of avocado crops in Quindio and the recent decimation of bees.\n\nBut rather than risk losing it all, Apicola Oro, which produces some 36 tons of honey a year, decided to pack up and leave. Salazar took most of his bees--some 1200 hives--from Quindio to a remote place some 400 km [approx. 248 mi] away. He has managed to save his business for now, but worries about the future. \"The bee is a bioindicator. If bees are dying, what other insects beneficial to the environment... are dying?\".\n\n[byline: Juan Sebastian Serrano]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Honey bee (_Apis mellifera_ L.) colony collapse disorder (CCD), which appeared in 2005/2006, still lingers in many parts of the world.

In a statement here [in Kota Kinabalu] yesterday (Sun 7 Mar 2021), deputy chief minister Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Jeffrey Kitingan said the virus was detected among domestic pigs in Kota Marudu and Pitas as well as wild bearded pigs in Lahad Datu, Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Beluran, and Telupid [Sabah province]. \"This includes the case of a dead wild bearded pig at a resort in the Kinabatangan district which went viral on social media last week [week of 1 Mar 2021],\" he said.\n\nFortunately, he said commercial pig farms in Tawau, Sandakan, Tenom, Papar, Tuaran, and Penampang that supply most of Sabah's pork products are still free of the ASF virus. \"We must ensure these areas remain ASF-free so that the pork production for local consumption is not affected. Even though ASF does not infect humans, it is capable of causing great economic damage as well as disrupting the well-being of our society. Therefore, it is crucial for us to control and eliminate this disease,\" he said.\n\nKitingan who is also the agriculture and fisheries minister, said the government will declare affected districts as ASF outbreak areas in accordance with the Animal Enactment 2015. This declaration, which would be made by the respective district and municipal administrators, would allow the DVS [Department of Veterinary Services] to carry out effective control measures through the District Disaster Management Committee. Pigs in areas where the ASF virus was found would be destroyed and disposed of and the areas disinfected, starting from the epicentre where the virus was first detected.\n\nThe Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) will also help to coordinate efforts to control the spread of the ASF virus from the wild bearded pigs to commercial pigs by suspending hunting licences and prohibiting the selling of 'sinalau bakas' as previously stated.\n\n\"We will set up the ASF Disease Crisis Management Committee, chaired by the DVS director. This committee will include the SWD, security forces, Local Government and Housing Ministry representatives, State Attorney-General Office representatives, and other related agencies. They will help to formulate the necessary policies to control and subsequently eradicate the ASF in Sabah as soon as possible,\" said Kitingan.\n\nSo far, he said a total of 110 pigs from nine villages in the ASF infection zone have been destroyed and disposed of. DVS has carried out its awareness campaigns in 54 out of 182 villages in Pitas.\n\nAs of Saturday [6 Mar 2021], a total of 347 samples were collected from various districts to detect the presence of the ASF virus throughout Sabah.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Malaysia's first ASF outbreak reportedly started on 8 Feb 2021. The immediate notification to the OIE, submitted 26 Feb 2021, addressed 5 locations in Sabah, a Malaysian state occupying the northern part of the island of Borneo which is shared between Malaysia and Indonesia. The report included the following epidemiological comments (see 20210227.8216574):\n\n\"The 1st reported case involved wild boar mortality. Following the death of wild boar in Kinabatangan (which tested negative with conventional PCR by Sabah Department of Veterinary Services Laboratory), the disease investigation was extended to the neighboring district, where the 1st case of mortality involving backyard pigs in Pitas was reported. After the laboratory confirmation, the surveillance is intensified and extended to other districts encompassing the 50-km (about 31 mi) radius from the index case. Sabah Wildlife Department reported on the wild boar mortality in Beluran district, where samples were taken and found positive for African swine fever. Surveillance then expanded outside the containment zone to cover the whole Sabah State. Currently, surveillance is conducted and intensified in the whole country.\"\n\nAccording to the current media report, the virus has been spreading further in Sabah in wild boar and domestic pigs.\n\nThe wild bearded pig (_Sus barbatus_) is a vulnerable animal species included in IUCN red list; see https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41772/123793370. There are 2 subspecies, _Sus barbatus barbatus_ from Peninsular (West) Malaysia, Borneo, and Sibutu Island (west of the Sulu Archipelago), which is the one currently known to be ASF-affected, and _Sus barbatus oi_ from Sumatra, Bangka, and Palang Bintang in the Riau Archipelago.\n\nASF continues its spread in Asia and Europe. In Asia, since the disease was first officially reported by China in August 2018, it has spread to Mongolia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, North Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, South Korea, East Timor, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, India, and now Malaysia. In Europe, its massive spread westwards has already reached Eastern Germany.\n\nNo vaccine against ASF is yet available; the virus is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS\n\nMaps of Malaysia: http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Malaysian.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3969.]\nSee Also\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (05): China (YN) domestic, spread, pathogenicity 20210304.8228499\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (04): Malaysia (SA) domestic, wild boar, 1st rep, OIE 20210227.8216574\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (03): China (Hong Kong) domestic, OIE 20210209.8179230\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (02): Philippines (LE, AL) spread 20210206.8169513\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (01): China, domestic, illicit vaccine susp 20210122.8126032\n2020\n---\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (26): Myanmar (SA) Laos (XA) domestic, OIE 20201109.7930204\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (25): India (ML) domestic 20200820.7698561\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (24): Philippines, Indonesia, spread 20200725.7611800\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (23): Myanmar (KH) domestic, spread, OIE 20200710.7560653\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (22): Viet Nam, spread 20200630.7526692\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (21): Myanmar (SH) domestic, spread, OIE 20200610.7447504\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (20): China (YN) domestic, OIE 20200609.7447396\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (19): China (YN) domestic, spread 20200605.7431321\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (18): China (GS) domestic, spread 20200530.7404403\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (17): North Korea (WN, HG) domestic, spread 20200523.7369070\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (16): India (AS, AR) domestic, 1st report, OIE 20200522.7366844\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (15): India (AS, AR) domest conf, spread, wild susp 20200516.7343308\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (14): India (AS, AR) susp, RFI 20200502.7292219\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (13): China, domestic, spread 20200429.7281181\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (12): China (SA, JS) domestic, spread, OIE 20200424.7265246\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (11): China (GS, CQ) domestic, spread, OIE 20200411.7210382\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (10): China (Inner Mongolia) domestic, OIE 20200402.7173440\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (09): China (HE) domestic, OIE 20200320.7118610\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (08): China (SC) domestic, OIE 20200317.7099923\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (07): China (HU) wild boar, OIE 20200310.7069728\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (06): Myanmar (KC) domestic, spread, OIE 20200305.7049853\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (05): Philippines (BT) spread 20200301.7037993\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (04): Myanmar (SH) domestic, OIE 20200220.7008827\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (03): South Korea, wild boar, Korean border, spread 20200218.7001603\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (02): Indonesia (BA) conf 20200207.6963293\nAfrican swine fever - Asia (01): Philippines (DC) spread 20200203.6949862\n.................................................arn/mj/sh", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8233859", "headline": "COVID-19 update (90): UK sewage, Viet Nam, Cambodia, WHO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8233859", "date": "2021-03-08 12:25:15", "main_text": "CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 UPDATE (90): UK SEWAGE MONITORING, VIET NAM, CAMBODIA, WHO\n***********************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Sewage monitoring\n[2] Viet Nam\n[3] From our regional networks: Cambodia\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 7 Mar 2021)\n[5] Global update: Worldometer accessed 7 Mar 2021 21:24 EST (GMT-5)\n\n******\n[1] Sewage monitoring\n[A] UK: schools\nDate: Sun 7 Mar 2021 08:15 GMT\nSource: The Guardian [edited]\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/07/covid-data-show-sewage-monitoring-could-be-vital-in-infection-control\n\n\nCOVID-19 data show sewage monitoring could be vital in infection control\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nA pilot study's analysis of schools' wastewater shows its potential as an early warning system for public health teams\n\nSchools may have had more COVID-19 infections before Christmas [2020] than previous research showed, according to data from a pilot study that senior public health experts believe could provide a crucial early warning system against future outbreaks. COVID-19 was present in the sewage of 80% of 16 primary and secondary schools in England during December [2020], and researchers detected the virus about a week before community testing, according to Mariachiara Di Cesare, a senior lecturer in public health at Middlesex University who led the study.\n\n\"In the earlier weeks, it was around 20% [of schools],\" she said. \"Starting from the end of November [2020], we saw an increase in the percentage that returned positive. And that was in line with a lag of a week before what was happening in the community.\" Di Cesare and other researchers from Term, a collaboration involving universities and the Joint Biosecurity Centre, saw a steady increase to 50% then 80% of schools taking part in the project, at a time when cases nationally seemed to be falling. \"We were really worried, but the samples were consistent in the school and in other schools in the area, so we could see the virus was circulating,\" she said.\n\nDi Cesare was keen to emphasise that the study, which took samples every 5 minutes from each school's wastepipe for 8 hours a day, had been attempting to show that wastewater could be used to discover COVID-19 outbreaks, rather than their scale or how transmission might be occurring. \"This is not data we would expect to be used to close a school,\" she said. \"One of the problems we are working on is how to communicate the data to public health teams.\"\n\nThe small sample size also means the study may not be representative of schools across England. A study by the Office for National Statistics of 105 schools in November [2020], using PCR testing, found the virus in 55% of schools in one day of testing, although it also said the data could not be used to extrapolate to the whole of England. However, because wastewater seems to provide earlier signs of COVI19 infection, public health officials believe it is better and cheaper than relying on PCR or lateral flow testing.\n\nMaggie Rae, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said having an effective early warning system in place was vital for preventing further outbreaks. \"Test and trace is not cost effective and it's not an early warning system,\" Rae said. \"Testing doesn't tell us how many people have got the virus, just those who have come forward for a test,\" she added. \"Wastewater could give you a very, very good sense of unknown infections that you can then track.\" Local authority public health teams could potentially identify an area where COVID-19 may be about to break out, and go door-to-door offering advice, support and testing equipment, she said.\n\nThe water supply and sewerage systems have been used for public health ever since John Snow, a London physician, proved in 1854 that cholera was spreading from a well in Soho. The National Wastewater Epidemiology Surveillance Programme [N-WESP] began looking last summer [2020] at whether COVID-19 could be reliably detected in sewage, taking samples at 96 treatment plants in England, Wales, and Scotland. Andrew Singer, who leads N-WESP, said they were able to detect COVID-19 in the sewer system when at least one in 10 000 people is infected -- about 15 people in a city the size of Oxford.\n\nThe growth of new COVID-19 variants is also detectable, he said. \"You can get an early insight into variants of interest and quickly assess how worried we should be about them.\"\n\nThe programme is being expanded to more than 200 sites in England, covering 80% of the population. Sewage is routinely monitored in Australia to detect COVID-19 outbreaks, and before the pandemic wastewater analysis was part of polio and norovirus detection in the UK. \"We have the oldest sewer network in the world, practically. When you compare that with Australia's, which has pipes that are 20 years old, and documentation that shows where they are -- to be honest, I'm envious how easy it is.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The benefits of testing sewage (wastewater) for RNA from SARS-CoV-2 were discussed in ProMED-mail 4 Nov 2020: COVID-19 update (470): USA contact tracing, sewage, WHO, global 20201104.7915703 and 20 Jun 2020 COVID-19 update (272): Italy sewage, Germany slaughterhouse, WHO, global 20200620.7490347. Both posts demonstrated the value of sewage testing for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 presence in the population. This approach to testing would allow schools to feel confident no one is infected. Similarly, it would work well for the military, prisons, nursing homes, and other groups of people. - Mod.LK]\n\n----\n[B] Wastewater surveillance\nDate: Sun 7 Mar 2021 [accessed]\nSource: CDC wastewater surveillance [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/wastewater-surveillance.html\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with agencies throughout the federal government, are initiating the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data generated by NWSS will help public health officials to better understand the extent of COVID-19 infections in communities.\n\nCDC is currently developing a portal for state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to submit wastewater testing data into a national database for use in summarizing and interpreting data for public health action. Participation in a national database will ensure data comparability across jurisdictions.\n\nData from wastewater testing are not meant to replace existing COVID-19 surveillance systems, but are meant to complement them by providing:\n- an efficient pooled community sample;\n- data for communities where timely COVID-19 clinical testing is underutilized or unavailable;\n- data at the sub-county level.\n\nWhat are the advantages of wastewater infectious disease surveillance?\n- Sewage testing has been successfully used as a method for early detection of other diseases, such as polio.\n- SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the feces of individuals with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection; therefore, wastewater surveillance can capture data on both types of infection.\n- Nearly 80 per cent of United States households are served by municipal sewage collection systems.\n- Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 measurements in untreated sewage can provide information on changes in total COVID-19 infection in the community contributing to that wastewater treatment plant (that area is known as the \"sewershed\".)\n- Depending on the frequency of testing, sewage surveillance can be a leading indicator of changes in COVID-19 burden in a community.\n- SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in sewage serves as a COVID-19 indicator that is independent of healthcare-seeking behaviors and access to clinical testing.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Viet Nam\nDate: Mon 1 Mar 2021\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/5/21-0013_article\n\n\nref: Phuong HVM, Tung TS, Trang UTH, et al.

PMID: 33647228\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nA cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in Danang, Viet Nam, began [25 Jul 2020], and resulted in 551 confirmed cases and 35 deaths as of February 2021. We analyzed 26 sequences from this cluster and identified a novel shared mutation in nonstructural protein 9, suggesting a single introduction into Viet Nam.\n\n----\nViet Nam experienced 2 clusters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections during [23 Jan-15 Apr 2020] (270 cases, 163/270 imported) (1-4). After 99 days without community transmission, a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections of unknown origin was detected in Danang; it was found in Danang General Hospital on [25 Jul 2020] in a 57 year old male patient (DN001) experiencing pneumonia who had no travel history. During a subsequent round of contact tracing, 14 additional SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were detected both in the community (n=3) and Danang hospitals (n=11). Viet Nam then initiated large-scale contact tracing and quarantining. A total of 551 confirmed cases were reported from 15 cities and provinces across the country; 540 (98%) either were related to major hospitals in Danang or were in patients who had visited Danang during [25 Jul-3 Sep 2020]. This cluster included 35 COVID-19 fatalities, most (32) hospital-acquired and associated with concurrent conditions or old age (2,5). Danang General Hospital, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported 246 cases among inpatients, caregivers, and healthcare workers. Strict prevention measures of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were again implemented nationally, and the outbreak was successfully contained. We describe the molecular epidemiology of this cluster.\n\nWe performed sequencing of 26 nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens that were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (Hanoi, Viet Nam) for diagnostics; all were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had cycle threshold value less than 30 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (6-8). Of those specimens, 18 were collected from patients in hospitals and communities in Danang and the rest from outside Danang: Ha Nam (1), Quang Nam (1), Thanh Hoa (1), Hanoi (2), Lang Son (2), and Hai Duong (1). We uploaded sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org; accession nos. 759869-91 and 766029-31).\n\nAll 26 sequences belonged to lineage B.1.1 and clustered together in the global tree, with the exception of DN013 (Figure, panel A). DN013 contains an additional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), C835T, that is also present in sequences from India and that artifactually clusters with those sequences in the global tree (Figure, panel A). A novel SNP at position 12772 (A>C) was found in all 26 sequences; it represents a nonsynonymous mutation in nonstructural protein 9 resulting in a leucine to phenylalanine change at amino acid site 4169 in open reading frame 1ab. This SNP was not reported in any other sequences collected globally and has no known associations with virulence or transmissibility. Sequences further clustered into 3 groups based on additional SNPs: cluster 1, a hospital cluster from the 2 largest hospitals in Danang (n=9); cluster 2, a simultaneously detected community cluster within the center of Danang (n=14); and cluster 3, a community cluster in the Son Tra district of Danang, detected August 6-8 (n=3).\n\nA synonymous mutation, C18687T, defines cluster 1 (Figure, panel B). Cases belonging to cluster 1 were mostly hospital-related (inpatients, caregivers, and workers). This mutation was later also found in 2 sequences (DN016 and DN017) from Lang Son Province in patients who had recently traveled to Danang but were not linked to the hospitals. Sample size and availability of clinical metadata are limited and therefore no conclusions about transmission route and associations with severity can be drawn.\n\nCluster 2 is a community cluster detected in the center of Danang and among epidemiologically linked cases across the country (Hai Duong, Ha Nam, Thanh Hoa, Quang Nam); sequences carry only the unique A12772C mutation associated with this outbreak. This cluster also contains case-patient DN013, with the additional C835T SNP. An epidemiologic link between the index patient, DN001 (cluster 1), and cases of cluster 2 has not been confirmed.\n\nCluster 3 is defined by an additional mutation, A8588G (K2775E in open reading frame 1ab), which was found in cases DN021, DN018, and DN025. Neither of these mutations was found among B1.1 sequences in the GISAID database.\n\nThe nonsynonymous A12772C mutation that all sequences shared, which acted as a biomarker to determine the relatedness of cases found within and outside of Danang, was not found in the GISAID database or elsewhere. This finding suggests that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 of unknown origin with potential undetected circulation in the community before detection in case DN001 was responsible for this cluster.\n\nThe lack of community cases found in Viet Nam for 99 days before this cluster, the observed high level of nucleotide identity (99.96% minimum, 99.97% median), and the presence of a unique shared mutation indicate that this virus was unlikely to have been circulating undetected in the community since April 2020 or that this outbreak was caused by multiple importations. Given the very low circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and restricted entry, contact tracing and quarantining of contacts on the basis of exposure rather than symptoms remain effective measures to prevent and contain circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Viet Nam.\n\n[The figure and references are available at the source URL above]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Quarantining of individuals who have had contact with infected individuals seems like a good approach, since a number of the exposed may be asymptomatic, but still capable of spreading virus.\n\nViet Nam has handled the pandemic very well. It has been suggested that the central reason for this is perhaps the way the government has depoliticised the pandemic, treating it purely as a health crisis, allowing for effective governance. There was no political motive for government officials to hide information, as they don't face being reprimanded if there are positive cases in their authority area that are not due to their mistakes. The government has also been clear that public health cannot be entangled with commercial interests.\n\nThe 2nd reason is that Viet Nam learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003 that there might be more in China than was at first apparent. In January 2020, when Wuhan announced the 1st death, Viet Nam tightened its border and airport control of Chinese visitors. This wasn't an easy decision, given that cross-border trade with China accounts for a significant part of the Vietnamese economy. When the first COVID-19 cases were announced in Viet Nam -- a father and son from China -- it took precautionary measures above and beyond World Health Organization recommendations, including health declaration and temperature screening at every border entry point and stopping flights to and from Wuhan. Preparations for a pandemic were implemented a week before the outbreak was officially a public health emergency of international concern, and more than a month before WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.\n\nThe government also decided to embrace freedom of information on COVID-19-related matters. Although the Vietnamese media is state owned, featuring ideological control similar to that of China, they are free to report about the pandemic. When a member of the central theoretical council of the central committee, the brain of the Communist party of Viet Nam, contracted the virus on a trip to the UK, and risked infecting the minister of planning and investment who was on the same flight as him, his whereabouts were published for contact tracing. This was another lesson learned from the experience of SARS (excerpted from (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/20/vietnam-covid-economic-growth-public-health-coronavirus). - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] From our regional networks: Cambodia\n[A]\nPRO/MBDS> COVID-19 update (10): Cambodia, 3rd community transmission 20210305.8229497\nDate: Fri 5 Mar 2021 09:28 ICT\nSource: The Phnom Penh Post [edited]\nhttps://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/cambodias-covid-cluster-cases-hit-425\n\n\nThe [Cambodia] Ministry of Health on [5 Mar 2021] confirmed 23 new cases of COVID-19 linked to the [20 Feb 2021] community transmission, bringing the total to 425 in just 2 weeks.\n\nThe 25 [sic] include 10 Cambodians, 11 Chinese nationals, and one each from Indonesia and Singapore.

We describe a case of reinfection from distinct virus lineages in Brazil harboring the E484K mutation, a variant associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Previous reports have documented co-infection of SARS-CoV2 with other respiratory pathogens; most common co-infections were rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.9%), respiratory syncytial virus (5.2%), and non-SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae (4.3%) [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764787]. We know that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to a detectable immune response, but the susceptibility of previously infected individuals to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in generation of neutralising antibodies in patients.1 However, the degree to which this immune response indicates a protective immunity to subsequent infection with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been elucidated. In studies of immunity to other coronaviruses, loss of immunity can occur within 1-3 years. Cases of primary illness due to infection followed by a discrete secondary infection or illness with the same biological agent can best be ascertained as distinct infection events by genetic analysis of the agents associated with each illness event. Reports of secondary infection events with SARS-CoV-2 have been published from Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Ecuador, the US, and Poland. Recently, Pedro et al reported a dual infection in a young patient which the authors postulated resulted in increased severity of disease and prolonged hospitalization [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/2/300/htm].\n\nTillet et al published a case report of an individual who had 2 distinct COVID-19 illnesses from genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 agents [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science /article/pii/S1473309920307647#cesec10]. The implications of co-infection and/or reinfections would be highly relevant for vaccine development and application. From a public health perspective, all individuals -- whether previously diagnosed or not -- must continue to take similar precautions to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[2] Global and Regional Adaptive Evolution of SARS-CoV-2\nDate: 2 Mar 2021\nSource: Biorxiv [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.336644v3.full.pdf\n\n\nAbstract\nUnderstanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed more than 300 000 high quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) associated region of the nucleocapsid protein are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals 4 distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March-July 2020, during a period of stasis in terms of inter-regional diversity. Finally, beginning in July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.\n\nSignificance\nUnderstanding the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control and ultimately end the pandemic. We analyzed more than 300 000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of January 2021 and demonstrate adaptive evolution of the virus that affects, primarily, multiple sites in the spike and nucleocapsid protein. Selection appears to act on combinations of mutations in these and other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Evolution of the virus is accompanied by ongoing adaptive diversification within and between geographic regions. This diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required. The epistatic network will continue to evolve through the entirety of the pandemic, and indeed, all emerging variants at the time of this writing are defined not by a single mutation but by an ensemble of signature mutations. Moreover, in addition to the apparent widespread intra-protein epistasis, there seem to exist multiple epistatic interactions between the N and S proteins. In particular, S/N501Y and N/S235F are both signature mutations for variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7_E484K, and this pair is in the top 25% of co-occurring pairs in our network ranked by lowest probability of random co-occurrence.\n\nAs with early founder mutations, when a new variant emerges with multiple signature mutations, it is unclear which, if any, confer a fitness advantage. Although it is natural to focus on substitutions within the RBD, we emphasize that all emergent variants contain substitutions in the vicinity of known NLS motifs. In fact, the most statistically significant signature mutation (based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence) for vAfrica (consistent with variant B.1.351, see below) is N/T205I. As we suggest for S/D614G, these variant signature mutations are likely to exert a greater influence through multiple epistatic interactions than in isolation, and each signature mutation can be a member of multiple epistatic ensembles beyond the group of signature mutations within which it was originally identified. Indeed, signature mutations are shared among defined variants, and we find evidence for an additional 18 putative epistatic interactions between variant signature mutations and other events throughout the tree which are not identified as signature mutations for any defined variant (Table S4, List 3). The growing ensemble of signature mutations that appear to be subject to positive selection and the existence of a robust network of putative epistatic interactions including these signatures, suggest that ongoing virus diversification is driven by host adaptation rather than occurring simply by neutral drift.\n\nConclusions\nVirus evolution during a pandemic is a fast-moving target, and unavoidably, aspects of this analysis will be outdated by the time of publication. Nevertheless, several trends revealed here appear general and robust. Although it is difficult to ascertain positive selection for individual sites, the overall adaptive character of SARS-CoV-2 evolution involving multiple amino acid replacements appears to be beyond reasonable doubt. As expected, there are multiple positively selected sites in the S protein, but more surprisingly, N protein includes several sites that appear to be strongly selected as well. The involvement of these adaptive substitutions in the nuclear localization of the N protein appears likely. Importantly, some of the mutations, for which positive selection was inferred, co-occur on multiple occasions and seem to form a robust epistatic network. Most likely, the effect of positive selection is manifested primarily at the level of epistatic interactions.\n\nClearly, despite the dramatic reduction of global travel, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is partly shaped by globalizing factors, including the increased virus fitness conferred by S/D614G, N/R203K&G204R, and other positively selected substitutions. However, we obtained strong evidence of both continuous virus diversification within geographic regions and \"speciation,\" that is, formation of stable, diverging region-specific variants. This ongoing adaptive diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Overall, a very comprehensive review of the evolutionary trends of SARS-CoV2. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[3] T Cell Response\n\n[A] Variant Recognition\nDate: 5 Mar 2021\nSource: Nature [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00502-w\n\n\nEmerging coronavirus variants do not seem to elude important immune-system players called T cells, laboratory studies suggest.\n\nSome recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 variants can partially evade antibodies generated in response to vaccination and previous infection, raising fears that vaccines will be less effective against the variants than against the original strain of the virus. Alessandro Sette and Alba Grifoni at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and their colleagues looked at whether these variants' mutations might also help them to evade T cells, a component of the immune system that is particularly important for reducing the severity of infectious diseases (A. Tarke et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/gh6tkp; 2021).\n\nThe team collected T cells from volunteers who had either recovered from infection with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain or had received an mRNA coronavirus vaccine. The researchers then tested the cells' ability to recognize protein snippets from 4 emerging variants, including the B.1.351 variant 1st identified in South Africa.\n\nMost of the volunteers' T cells recognized all 4 variants, thanks to viral protein snippets that were unaffected by the variants' mutations. The results suggest that T cells could target these variants.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Current estimates of population immunity rely solely on seroprevalence studies; however, in the context of evidence for cellular responses in seronegative exposed individuals, and the potential waning of antibody responses over time, current surveillance methods are likely to be underestimating both exposure and immunity. Understanding the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development, epidemiological surveillance, and disease control strategies. In a systematic review of 61 studies by Shrotri et al; the authors noted that \"A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies, as well as a striking lack of research in asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the T cell response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.\"\n\nA more in-depth understanding of the role of T cells in long-term protection will be helpful to policy makers in terms of predictive modelling where population-level immunity lies and informing long-term surveillance and immunisation strategies. - Mod.UBA]\n\n------\n[B] T cell Assay\nDate: 6 Mar 2021\nSource: Financial Times [edited]\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/3a3d8fcc-28db-4190-8740-2ce962dd361b\n\n\nThe 1st test for a T-cell response to the virus behind Covid-19 has received emergency approval for use in the US, creating another option for people to discover whether they have had the disease. Adaptive Biotechnologies, a Seattle-based biotech company, worked with Microsoft to create the blood test, which can be more accurate than some of the antibody tests on the market. As well as creating antibodies, the immune system produces T-cells in response to an infection. T-cells are white blood cells that can directly kill infected cells or help B-cells stimulate the production of antibodies.\n\nLance Baldo, chief medical officer at Adaptive, said T-cells were important because they have a \"very long memory,\" appearing to remain in the body for at least 6 to 9 months. Given how the pandemic has only been around for a year, they could remain even longer. Baldo said this could be particularly useful for people suffering from \"long Covid\" -- with symptoms that persist over months -- who may not have had a positive test at the time. It could help shape their care, and in the US, it may influence what insurers will pay for. \"You have these people with long-term Covid; they're not sure if they were ever really infected; their antibodies are definitely gone; they're not going to have a positive PCR [diagnostic test], and they're just calling us saying, 'I want to know whether 3 months ago, 6 months ago, 9 months ago, I actually had the coronavirus,'\" he said.\n\nAdaptive's lab tests, which have already been available from concierge medicine practices, can now be ordered by doctors across the US. The emergency use authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration comes after a study showed that T-cells could play an important role in the immune response to new variants. Researchers at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and the University of California said they found that T-cell responses in the vaccinated, or previously infected, were just as robust with the variants 1st identified in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and California. Adaptive says its research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showed its test detects 97 per cent of people who have had the disease, compared with antibody tests that vary between 77 to 97 per cent. The proportion of false negatives was less than one per cent. There has not yet been enough research into whether the discovery of these T-cells mean people are immune to the Sars-Cov-2 virus.\n\nBut Adaptive is hoping patients who take the test will opt into research, which will allow the company to follow them and see whether any develop Covid-19. Adaptive is also working with vaccine developers, which have so far focused on whether their shots elicit an antibody response, to see whether they achieve a T-Cell reaction, too. Microsoft's machine learning tools helped Adaptive map the body's immune system. Adaptive also plans to create tests for T-Cell response to other infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, and autoimmune disease.\n\n[Byline: Hannah Kuchler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Diagnosis of COVID-19 is routinely achieved by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs via quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR); however, even symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections frequently remain unrecognized. When symptomatic, COVID-19 can range from a mild, common flu-like sickness in around 85% of cases to a severe respiratory disease in around 15% of affected patients.\n\nCurrently available tests for prior exposure to coronavirus rely on the detection of antibodies, which tend to diminish in titers within a couple of months after being infected with the virus. Previously identified T cells in patients recovering from COVID-19 have shown that they do not cross-react to other seasonal coronaviruses.\n\nThere are other T cell detection assays under development in the UK and the US that can provide a more reliable way to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over a much longer period following infection. Furthermore, if the presence of antiviral T cells can be linked to protection from future infections, these tests can provide valuable information on the course of the pandemic and a safe return to normal life. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[4] Variants\n\n[A] Japan\nDate: 4 Mar 2021\nSource: Yahoo News [edited]\nhttps://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/eafd42d2c17ce977783d6fcf8e367616096a28e4\n\n\nOsaka Prefecture announced on 4 Mar 2021 that it was confirmed that a total of 64 people had been infected with a mutant strain of the new coronavirus since January 2021 in the prefecture.

According to the statement, these measures aim to preserve the livestock and economic resources of poultry farmers. The statement did not mention additional details about the extent of the virus spread or the number of dead poultry.\n\nLast month [February 2021], Algeria declared a state of high alert after the World Organisation for Animal Health announced the registration of a bird flu focus in the eastern state of Oum El Bouaghi (adjacent to the state of Batna), which was spotted at the end of last January [2021].\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture attributed the source of the virus at the time to migratory birds and confirmed that \"the epidemic has been brought under control.\"\n\nLaboratory analyzes revealed the spread of avian influenza in the Ain Fakroun region in the state of Umm El-Bouaghi, and 51 200 chickens were affected, most of them dead, before the area was isolated [see comment].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For the location of the town Seriana in the Algerian province Batna, see map at https://tinyurl.com/vp7msw.\n\nThe previously mentioned event in Ain Fakroun, Oum El Bouaghi was reported by the Algerian authorities to the OIE in an immediate notification dated 8 Feb 2021 (see 20210211.8183060).

[Currently there is no evidence of this more aggressive form in the USA. - Mod.TG]\n\nEHV-1 most often causes mild-to-moderate respiratory illness (rhinopneumonitis), but the infection occasionally leads to the life-threatening neurologic disease equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), [which] occurs when EHV-1 attacks the cells lining the central nervous system, damaging blood vessels serving the brain and spinal cord. The mechanisms through which EHV-1 produces neurologic disease are not yet understood. [EHM has always been a devastating disease to horses, and this form of the disease has no preventative vaccine. - Mod.TG]\n\nThere is no vaccine that specifically protects against EHM, so biosecurity is a crucial part of prevention. EHV-1 spreads from horse to horse through nasal discharge or aerosol droplets. Humans can spread the virus via contaminated hands, clothing, and equipment.\n\nThe 8-year-old mare in Florida developed ataxia and weakness in her hind limbs on 1 Mar [2021], and the diagnosis of neurologic EHV-1 was confirmed on 3 Mar [2021], according to the Equine Disease Control Communication Center (EDCC). Although it has not been confirmed that the mare has the more aggressive strain, veterinary officials are encouraging everyone in the equestrian community to be vigilant, cautious, and careful. The following statement appeared on the EDCC website:\n\n\"As of 3 Mar [2021], the affected horse continues to be treated in a separate isolation facility. No additional EHV-1 cases have been detected. The Division of Animal Industry placed the premises under quarantine and immediately began a disease investigation. Additional movement requirements or restrictions have not been imposed by Florida or any other states at this time. We are advising horse owners and trainers to contact the venue of destination for any additional requirements prior to travel.\n\n\"However, in light of the recent EHV-1 outbreak in Europe, we are encouraging all facilities to isolate horses importing into Florida from the affected regions in Europe and enact strict biosecurity measures to include monitoring the horse's health and taking temperatures twice per day for at least 14 days. We are asking all those in the equine community to practice prudent biosecurity on their farms and to report any suspected cases of EHV-1.\n\n\"For reporting, call (850) 410-0900 Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. and 1-800-342-5869 after hours and weekends, or email RAD@FDACS.gov. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services will continue to work with the affected premises management, owners, and veterinarians to ensure proper safeguards are taken to prevent further spread of the disease.\"\n\nThe emergence of a very aggressive strain of neurologic EHV-1 from Spain led the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI), the international governing body of Olympic equestrian disciplines, to cancel nearly all competitions in mainland Europe earlier this week until at least 28 Mar [2021].\n\nFEI Secretary General Sabrina Ibanez said in a statement at the time \"...this EHV-1 outbreak is probably the most serious we have had in Europe for many decades, and our decision is based on clearly identified epidemiological risk factors.\n\n\"This strain of EHV-1 is particularly aggressive and has already caused equine fatalities and a very large number of severe clinical cases. We need to keep our horses safe. We are also aware that a large number of horses left the venue in Valencia without an official health certificate, meaning they had an unknown health status. Some horses were already sick, and the risk of transmission from these horses is a major concern.\"\n\nThere are 53 potentially exposed horses at the Florida stable.\n\n[Byline: Christine Barakat]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Florida\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: Horses Daily\nhttps://horsesdaily.com/article/breaking-news-world-equestrian-center-locks-down-facility-due-ehv-1-outbreak\n\n\nThe FEI [Federation Equestre Internationale] announced 1 Mar [2021] that competition has been cancelled until 28 Mar [2021] in 10 European countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands, Germany, and Slovakia due to the outbreak of the equine herpesvirus.\n\nAs of 3 Mar [2021], there has only been one case of EHV 1 reported in Ocala, Florida, by the Equine Disease Communication Center; all facilities and show management are on high alert.\n\nAs the virus has now been identified in Ocala, and out of an abundance of caution, World Equestrian Center - Ocala management has issued increased biosecurity measures and the following to keep showing horses safe:\n\n[It is unclear from the above if this particular strain of EHV-1, also known as EHM, is the same strain as what Europe has, or if it is the neurological form the US has continued to battle and ProMED-mail has reported on.

The affected horse was euthanized.\n\nThe limited number of potentially exposed horses have been identified and are being contacted by New Bolton Center and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. Due to the limited nature of the potential exposure, New Bolton Center's clinical hospital operations have not been affected. This case has no known association with international travel, transport, or exhibition. New Bolton Center is working closely with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and will provide additional updates as they become available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) comprise 2 antigenically distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2 of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis. Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in abortion.\n\n\"Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical or subclinical infection with EHV-1. The neurologic form of EHV-1 has demonstrated increasing morbidity and mortality in the documented outbreaks since 2000 and appears to be evolving in virulence and behavior. Therefore, the USDA has designated neuropathic EHV-1 as a potentially emerging disease. The natural reservoir of both EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent infections and carrier states are seen with both virus types. Transmission occurs by direct or indirect contact with infectious nasal secretions, aborted fetuses, placentas, or placental fluids.\n\n\"The incubation period of EHV is 2-10 days. Susceptible horses develop fever of 102-107 deg F (38.9-41.7 deg C), neutropenia and lymphopenia, serous nasal discharge, malaise, pharyngitis, cough, inappetence, and/or submandibular or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy. Horses infected with EHV-1 strains often develop a biphasic fever, with cell-associated viremia coinciding with the 2nd temperature peak. Secondary bacterial infections are common and manifest with mucopurulent nasal exudate and pulmonary disease. The infection is mild or inapparent in horses immunologically sensitized to the virus.\n\n\"Mares that abort after EHV-1 infection seldom display premonitory signs. Abortions occur 2-12 wk after infection, usually between months 7 and 11 of gestation. Aborted fetuses are fresh or minimally autolyzed, and the placenta is expelled shortly after abortion. There is no evidence of damage to the mare's reproductive tract, and subsequent conception is unimpaired. Mares exposed late in gestation may not abort but give birth to live foals with fulminating viral pneumonitis. Such foals are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections and usually die within hours or days.\n\n\"Lesions:\nThe pathogenetic mechanisms of EHV-1 and EHV-4 differ significantly. EHV-4 infection is restricted to respiratory tract epithelium and associated lymph nodes; EHV-1 strains develop cell-associated viremia and have a predilection for vascular endothelium, especially the nasal mucosa, lungs, placenta, adrenal, thyroid, and CNS. The neuropathic strain of EHV-1 produces a viremic load 10- to 100-fold higher than that of non-neuropathic strains.\n\n\"Gross lesions of viral rhinopneumonitis are hyperemia and ulceration of the respiratory epithelium, and multiple, tiny, plum-colored foci in the lungs. Histologically, there is evidence of inflammation, necrosis, and intranuclear inclusions in the respiratory epithelium and germinal centers of the associated lymph nodes. Lung lesions are characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the terminal bronchioles, peribronchiolar and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, and serofibrinous exudate in the alveoli.\n\n\"Typical lesions in EHV-1 abortion include interlobular lung edema and pleural fluid; multifocal areas of hepatic necrosis; petechiation of the myocardium, adrenal gland, and spleen; and thymic necrosis. Intranuclear inclusions are found in lung, liver, adrenal, and lymphoreticular tissues.\n\n\"Diagnosis:\nEquine viral rhinopneumonitis is difficult to clinically differentiate from equine influenza (see equine influenza, https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/equine-influenza), equine viral arteritis (see equine viral arteritis, https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/equine-viral-arteritis/overview-of-equine-viral-arteritis), or other equine respiratory infections solely on the basis of clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is determined by PCR or virus isolation from samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab and citrated blood sample (buffy coat) early in the course of the infection.\n\n\"In cases of suspected EHV-1 abortion, definitive diagnosis is based on PCR, virus isolation, and characteristic gross and microscopic lesions in the aborted fetus. Lung, liver, adrenal, and lymphoreticular tissues are productive sources of virus. Serologic testing of mares after abortion has little diagnostic value. Diagnosis of neuropathic EHV-1 is determined by real-time PCR on samples obtained from nasal secretions, CSF, or neural tissue to detect the neuropathic strain of EHV-1. A presumptive diagnosis can be based on clinical signs and CSF analysis (xanthochromia, albuminocytologic dissociation). Necropsy reveals characteristic perivascular cuffing and hemorrhage in the CNS.\n\n\"Treatment:\nThere is no specific treatment for EHV infection. Rest and nursing care are indicated to minimize secondary bacterial complications. Antipyretics are recommended for horses with a fever greater than 104 deg F (40 deg C). Antibiotic therapy is instituted upon suspicion of secondary bacterial infection evidenced by purulent nasal discharge or pulmonary disease. Most foals infected prenatally with EHV-1 die shortly after birth despite intensive nursing and antimicrobial medication. If horses with neuropathic EHV-1 remain ambulatory or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually favorable. Valacyclovir (30 mg/kg, PO, bid) has shown promise in the treatment of affected horses and in prophylaxis during EHV-1 outbreaks. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae.\n\n\"Control:\nImmunity after natural infection with either EHV-1 or EHV-4 involves a combination of humoral and cellular immunity. Whereas little cross-protection occurs between virus types after primary infection of immunologically naive foals, significant cross-protection develops in horses after repeated infections with a particular virus type. Most adult horses are latently infected with EHV-1 and EHV-4. The infection remains dormant for most of the horse's life, although stress or immunosuppression may result in recrudescence of disease and shedding of infectious virus. Immunity to reinfection of the respiratory tract may persist for as long as 3 mo, but multiple infections result in a level of immunity that prevents clinical signs of respiratory disease. Diminished resistance in pregnant mares allows cell-associated viremia, which may result in transplacental infection of the fetus.\n\n\"For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases, management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated for 21 days before commingling with resident horses, especially pregnant mares. Management-related, stress-inducing circumstances should be avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant mares should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings, yearlings, and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory disease or abortion, affected horses should be isolated and appropriate measures taken for disinfection of contaminated premises. No horse should leave the premises for 3 wk after recovery of the last clinical case.\n\n\"Vaccination (EHV-4 and EHV-1) should begin when foals are 4-6 mo old. A 2nd dose is given 4-6 wk later, and a 3rd dose at 10-12 mo of age. Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 6 mo through maturity (5 yr of age). Vaccination programs against herpesviruses should include all horses that travel to high-risk destinations (racetrack, show grounds) and all other horses on the premises. A high-antigen load, inactivated EHV-1 vaccine is recommended to prevent EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during months 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Mares are often vaccinated with inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 at an interval 4-6 wk before foaling. A modified-live EHV-1 vaccine is available to help prevent respiratory disease caused by EHV-1.\"\n\nExtracted from https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/equine-herpesvirus-infection. -

He was airlifted to a hospital where he died on 1 Mar 2021, according to police.\n\nThe Australian box jellyfish, or _Chironex fleckeri_, is among the world's most venomous creatures. It is found primarily in Australia's tropical northern waters, where swimmers are warned to keep out of the ocean or wear a full-body protective swimsuit during the summer \"stinger season.\"\n\nMarine biologist Lisa-Ann Gershwin said it was Australia's 1st recorded box jellyfish death since 2006. \"Unfortunately, the previous fatality also occurred in Bamaga,\" she told public broadcaster ABC. Gershwin said deaths were avoidable, but people living far from cities were most vulnerable.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following has been extracted from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190430173205.htm, with original article at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09681-1:\n\n\"Pain researchers uncover secrets to box jellyfish venom\n\n\"Summary: Researchers studying how pain works have discovered an antidote to the deadly sting delivered by the most venomous creature on Earth -- the Australian box jellyfish. A single sting to a human causes necrosis of the skin, excruciating pain and, if the dose of venom is large enough, cardiac arrest and death within minutes. The new antidote, discovered using CRISPR genome editing techniques, blocks the symptoms within 15 minutes after contact.\n\n\"The Australian box jellyfish (_Chironex fleckeri_) has about 60 tentacles that can grow up to 3 metres long. Each tentacle has millions of microscopic hooks filled with venom. Each box jellyfish carries enough venom to kill more than 60 humans.\n\n\"Associate Professor Greg Neely and Dr. Raymond (Man-Tat) Lau and their team of pain researchers at the Charles Perkins Centre at University of Sydney were studying how the box jellyfish venom works when they made the discovery. They uncovered a medicine that blocks the symptoms of a box jellyfish sting if administered to the skin within 15 minutes after contact.\n\n\"The antidote was shown to work on human cells outside the body and then tested effectively on live mice. Researchers now hope to develop a topical application for humans.\"\n\nThe following information about _Chironex fleckeri_ jellyfish has been extracted from https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chironex_fleckeri/:\n\n\"Geographic range: _Chironex fleckeri_, also known as box jellyfish, lives in and around the waters of Australia and Southeast Asia. They inhabit parts of the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the Great Barrier Reef. Box jellyfish have been found in the waters on the western coast of Australia in the Exmouth Gulf to Gladstone in the northern waters of Australia. Humans are frequently stung by this species in the oceanic waters of Queensland, on Australia's eastern coast. Box jellyfish may also be responsible for stings near the Philippines (Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995; Tibballs, 2006).\n\n\"Habitat: Box jellyfish tend to inhabit shallow, murky saline waters near Australia. They are mainly found in the ocean but are also found inland in freshwater rivers and mangrove channels when spawning. During heavy storms, they move into deeper waters where the water is calm to avoid damage. Box jellyfish also inhabit shallow rivers during the reproductive season and during their polyp stage. Once young jellyfish mature into medusa, they follow the river out to sea (Currie and Jacups, 2005; Hamner, 1995; Tibballs, 2006).\n\n\"Physical description: The name box jellyfish is derived from the shape of their bell, which is box-shaped when healthy. The bell is transparent and is usually between 16 and 24 cm, though some reach a diameter of 35 cm. The tentacles of box jellyfish dangle from pedalia, the corners of the bell. There can be as many as 15 tentacles hanging from each of the 4 pedalia for a total of up to 60 tentacles per jellyfish. Each of the tentacles has a slight blue-gray tint and can grow up 3 m in length. Each tentacle contains millions of nematocysts, which are microscopic hooks where venom is held and delivered. Box jellyfish contain sensory organs including 24 eyes, but they do not have a brain (Carrette et al., 2002; Currie and Jacups, 2005; Hamner, 1995; Seymour et al., 2004; Tibballs, 2006).\n\n\"Other physical features: ectothermic, radial symmetry, venomous\n\"Range mass: up to 2 kg or 4.41 pounds\n\"Range length: up to 3 meters or 9.84 feet\n\n\"Behavior: Box jellyfish have several behavioral traits setting it apart from other jellyfish. Most notably, box jellyfish can actively swim, whereas most species of jellyfish float wherever the current takes them with no control over their direction. Although box jellyfish have the ability to move up to 4 knots, during the day they typically travel at 1 knot or less. Box jellyfish usually swim slower during the day than at night, which is likely due to hunting and consuming of prey. Unlike other jellyfish, box jellyfish rest on the sea floor, not moving unless disturbed. Box jellyfish may require this rest phase to energetically compensate for the time they spend actively swimming. Box jellyfish also display this type of behavior when seas are rough, during which they sink to the sea floor until the water calms. Box jellyfish also unintentionally sting humans. The sting of a box jellyfish can be fatal to humans and has accounted for more than 60 deaths in the last 100 years. Most fatalities are documented in children and young adults (Gordon and Seymour, 2009; Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995; Hartwick, 1991; Seymour and Sutherland, 2001; Tibballs, 2006).\n\n\"Communication and perception: Because box jellyfish have no brain, it is difficult to define their communication and perception. Box jellyfish do have eyes, which have photoreceptors. Photoreceptors give box jellyfish the ability to detect light from dark, but it is uncertain whether this species can process shapes and figures. Box jellyfish, however, are attracted to light and tend to avoid darker shapes. Box jellyfish can also detect vibrations, which is thought to be useful for finding prey and avoiding predators. Currently, little is known regarding methods of communication between jellyfish. If box jellyfish do communicate with one another, it is most likely through chemical signals (Coates, 2003; Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995).\n\n\"The study of box jellyfish venom has led to a successful anti-venom agent, which can save human lives if administered quickly. Additionally, while this research is still in its infancy, scientists hope to better understand why jellyfish venom is so harmful to the human cardiovascular system. Once determined, this information can hopefully be used to design more effective medicine for other cardiovascular problems (Hodgson and Isbister, 2009; Seymour and Sutherland, 2001; Tibballs, 2006; Winter et al., 2009).\n\n\"Box jellyfish are believed to be the most venomous creatures in the world. Their stings are extremely deadly to human beings and have caused over 60 deaths in the last century. The amount of venom injected into humans by box jellies influences the certainty of death. It is estimated that if a total of 6 m of tentacles comes into contact with human skin -- and therefore all nematocysts on those tentacles \"fire\" -- the amount of venom injected is sufficient to cause death in just a few minutes. Shortly after a human is stung, they typically encounter symptoms such as extreme pain, shortness of breath, and purple welts. Some victims may also become irrational and suffer cardiac arrest. All of these symptoms typically commence within 5 minutes of being stung and can last up to 2 weeks before subsiding. Although box jellyfish are fully capable of killing adult humans, most fatalities are documented in children and young adults. To reduce fatalities, box jellyfish nets have been constructed on many beaches where box jellyfish stings are known to occur. Despite these nets, there are still reports of stings every year (Coates, 2003; Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995; Seymour and Sutherland, 2001; Tibballs, 2006).\"\n\nFor additional information, full references and contributor details, see https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chironex_fleckeri/. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nNorthern Territory, Australia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/292]\nSee Also\n2010\n----\nToxic jellyfish - Australia: increased risk 20100114.0163\n2002\n----\nToxic jellyfish, deadly - Australia (Queensland) 20020627.4615\n.................................................sb/tg/rd/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8232248", "headline": "Avian influenza (41): Sweden (SN), Niger (NI) poultry, HPAI H5N5, H5N1, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8232248", "date": "2021-03-06 15:28:21", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (41): SWEDEN (SKANE), NIGER (NIAMEY) POULTRY, HPAI H5N5, H5N1, OIE\n**********************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this posting:\n[1] Sweden (Skane): poultry, HPAI H5N5\n[2] Niger (Niamey): poultry, HPAI H5N1\n\n******\n[1] Sweden (Skane): poultry, HPAI H5N5\nDate: Fri 5 Mar 2021\nSource: OIE, Disease Alerts, 2021 [edited]\nhttps://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/CUTOVER_OIE-WAHIS/SWEDEN_HPAI_149037_05032021.pdf\n\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, Sweden\n-----------------------------------------\nInformation received on 5 Mar 2021 from Dr. Emeli Torsson, Senior Veterinary Advisor, Sweden\n\nSummary\nReport type: Immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 2 Mar 2021\nDate of confirmation of the event: 3 Mar 2021\nReason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 19 Nov 2020\nManifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\nSerotype: H5N5\nNature of diagnosis: Laboratory (basic and advanced)\nThis event pertains to a defined zone within the country.\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\nSummary of outbreaks\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak location: Trelleborg [Skane County]\nDate of start of the outbreak: 2 Mar 2021\nOutbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)\nEpidemiological unit: Farm\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nBirds / 18 000 / 3000 / 3000 / 15 000 / 0\nAffected population: This is a farm with organic laying hens, housing around 18 000 animals.

This 2020/21 epizootic is marked by the significant involvement and mortality of wild birds. As the risk of virus introductions via migratory wild birds remains high, countries should stay vigilant, and implement effective surveillance and monitoring measures for early detection and response.\n\n\"What are the causes of the current wave of avian influenza cases and is it worse than in previous years?\n\"Molecular characterization of the currently circulating AI virus subtypes shows genetic variability from previous years. This might be explained by multiple reassortments with low pathogenic viruses circulating in wild birds. The evolution of the viruses and these recent events need to be closely monitored and further studied in order to assess the risks.\n\n\"It is most likely that migratory wild birds, followed by local farming practices, have contributed to the dissemination and introduction of the virus into new countries and farms. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics in many countries associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17.\n\n\"The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new subtypes, which were also reported by countries.\n\n\"What factors can facilitate the spread of avian influenza?\n\"The dynamic of the spread of influenza viruses is extremely complex and difficult to predict. Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity and immunity status.\n\n\"During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties.\n\n\"At [a] local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented.\n\n\"What is the risk of avian influenza for human health?\n\"The epidemiology of AI viruses is complex: They can change and evolve by mutation and reassortment, with the emergence of new subtypes causing significant impacts on animal health and production. Some subtypes -- not all -- can be zoonotic and therefore pose a threat to human health.\n\n\"Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.\n\n\"In February 2021, human cases of AI subtype H5N8 were reported by Russian authorities to the World Health Organization (WHO). The OIE/FAO network of experts on animal influenza (OFFLU) analyzed the preliminary information of the event and stated that, to date, there is no evidence to suggest that severe human infections or human-to-human transmission of this virus have occurred. This situation likely represents an isolated spillover event of the virus, as genetic evidence suggests that these viruses were derived from chickens with no adaptation to humans.\n\n\"More

have succumbed to a suspected outbreak of the viral infection capripox.\n\nThe 1st case was detected in November last year [2020]. According to the rescue focal officer of JKSNR, Kinley Tenzin, an observed symptom is the development of skin lesions and gradual peeling off.\n\nSo far, 3 Himalayan serows, one wild boar and a barking deer were reported dead from the disease. \"One animal was found sick and died within a night. Others were found dead by the officials,\" he said.\n\nOther symptoms of capripox are characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles, and internal lesions. Infected animals eventually die. The disease is caused by strains of capripoxvirus.\n\nKinley Tenzin said that there was no history of such outbreaks in the area but was earlier reported at Chari in Thimphu.\n\nThe nasal swab, eye swab, and lesion swab samples from the 1st dead animal, however, tested negative for foot-and-mouth disease and peste des petits ruminants, also known as PPR. He said that the place had been disinfected, and people in the area were informed not to consume the meat of dead wild animals.\n\nTo reduce public health risks, the notification issued by the park on 27 Feb 2021 asked the public to refrain from touching and/or lifting dead wild animals like deer, serow and wild pig from the forest.\n\nCapripox in goats was first reported from Norway in 1879, while sheep pox originated in Central Asia. In India, goat pox was reported for the 1st time in 1936.\n\n[Byline: Choki Wangmo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Capripox viruses (Poxviridae) cause sheep pox, goat pox, or lumpy skin disease in cattle, a malignant cutaneous disease. Goat pox virus (GTPV) is the etiological agent of goat pox, which is closely related to sheep pox virus (SPPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) of cattle.

Multitude of coronavirus variants found in the USA -- but the threat is unclear. Nature News. Epub 5 Mar 2021. https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00564-4\n\nFor the scientists who have spent the past year poring over hundreds of thousands of coronavirus genomes, the United States has been an enigma. Despite having world-leading genome sequencing infrastructure and experiencing more COVID infections than any other country, the United States has until recently lagged far behind in sequencing coronavirus genomes and spotting worrisome variants.\n\nBut in recent weeks, US researchers have identified a host of new variants, including in California, New York State, Louisiana and elsewhere. And they are continuing to ramp up SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts.\n\nThat has brought another challenge: making sense of the variants that are discovered. They carry potentially worrying mutations and might be becoming more common, but a dearth of data on how the variants are spreading means the threat they pose is unclear.\n\n\"It's a Wild West,\" says Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport who co-led a team that, last month [February 2021], spotted a fast-rising variant in Louisiana, New Mexico and elsewhere. In the absence of clear data on a variant's behaviour, \"it's as if there's an unofficial policy that every variant is a variant of concern until proven otherwise,\" says Kamil.\n\nPart of the challenge is the decentralized nature of US coronavirus sequencing and surveillance efforts. \"Right now it's individual labs or states or cities doing their part,\" says David Ho, a virologist at Columbia University in New York City, whose team last week identified a variant in the city with a mutation that could compromise immune responses. As a result of this piecemeal effort, states such as New York, California and Washington have contributed thousands of sequences each, while others such as Iowa, Tennessee and New Hampshire have obtained sequences from far fewer of their COVID cases.\n\nHo and other US researchers look enviously at the United Kingdom, where a nationwide sequencing effort -- which works closely with public-health, medical and research institutions to make sense of variants -- has generated more than 300 000 coronavirus genomes. Thanks to the fine granularity of its data, the UK effort showed in late 2020 that the variant called B.1.1.7 clearly spread faster than the circulating strains it would go on to displace; subsequent research has suggested that B.1.1.7 might be deadlier but does not compromise vaccines.\n\n\"I don't think we have anything like that,\" says Ho. He hopes that the US National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal agencies responsible for biomedical research and public health, \"will get the country moving in a more concerted fashion.\" A CDC-led effort launched in November [2020] is aiming to sequence around 7000 samples per week -- a goal met for the 1st time in late February [2021] -- and eventually 25 000.\n\nIn the absence of clear-cut epidemiological or medical data, scientists can gauge some of a variant's potential threat by the mutations it carries. Researchers have drawn up a growing list of mutations that might boost transmission or help a virus evade immune responses, based on laboratory and epidemiological studies.\n\nThe variant that Ho's team identified in New York, also known as B.1.526, carries a notorious mutation called E484K that has been found in variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. Studies by multiple labs have shown that the E484K change -- which is in a portion of the coronavirus spike protein that recognizes host cells -- weakens the potency of antibodies that can ordinarily disable the virus. That could help explain observations that similar variants in South Africa and Brazil are behind cases of reinfection and reduced vaccine efficacy in field trials.\n\nOn the basis of those concerns, a team led by Ho and Columbia University microbiologist Anne-Catrin Uhlemann set up a surveillance network to identify viruses carrying E484K in New York City. The 1st cases of the B.1.526 variant appeared in November [2020], growing to 5% of the city's total cases in mid-January [2021] and 12% by February [2021]. In public sequencing databases, the researchers found B.1.526 up and down the northeast coast of the United States and as far away as Singapore. The notoriety of E484K also inspired a team led by Pamela Bjorkman and Anthony West, structural biologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to trawl through public sequencing data, where they spotted the lineage emerging in New York.\n\nHo concedes that B.1.526 needs much more study. It has not yet been shown to dodge immune responses and its apparent rise in frequency may be unrelated to any biological property. \"It's taken months for the UK variant [B.1.1.7] to be shown to be more transmissible and more virulent. I think we would need to do the same,\" he says.\n\nBeefed-up US sequencing efforts are turning up variants with new or rarely seen mutations that are harder to make sense of. Kamil teamed up with researchers in New Mexico because they had also observed rising numbers of cases caused by a variant, which they dubbed Pelican, bearing a mutation they hadn't seen before. They identified several other variants in US sequencing data that carried a similar change. (All were given bird nicknames, including Robin, Yellowhammer and Mockingbird.)\n\nThe mutation, called Q677P, sits near a region of the spike protein that needs to snap in two to allow the viral particle to enter a host cell. Mutations in this region occur in fast-spreading variants such as B.1.1.7, but Kamil says the Pelican variant is, for now, one to watch rather than worry over. \"It's too early to say with any scientific confidence that it's a particularly worrisome mutation,\" he says.\n\nLast week, researchers in California raised a red flag over variants found there that carry a spike protein mutation called L452R (1). A team at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that a variant with the mutation was rising rapidly in one city neighbourhood, from being present in 16% of sequenced samples in November [2020] to more than half in mid-January [2021]. Another UCSF team found, in lab tests, that a variant with the L452R mutation was more infectious and less susceptible to antibodies, according to media reports.\n\nBut many researchers have expressed scepticism of the significance of the L452R variants. The mutation hasn't turned up in lab studies that have flagged several other worrisome changes, such as E484K, and the same L452R mutation has popped up elsewhere in the United States and not grown rapidly, says Jeffrey Barrett, a statistical geneticist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK. \"It's probably not going to be one of these ones that is fundamentally problematic,\" he says. \"It's a question of waiting and watching to see what happens in California and elsewhere.\"\n\nWhile researchers try to make sense of newly discovered US variants, redoubled sequencing efforts are also turning up more cases linked to global variants of concern. So far, researchers in the United States have uncovered only a handful of cases linked to immune-evading variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. But cases of the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the United Kingdom are rising steadily -- a pattern repeated in other countries in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWhich of these variants will predominate is anyone's guess, say researchers, but as vaccination ramps up, susceptible variants such as B.1.1.7 could dwindle, while those that can partly evade immunity might spark regional flare-ups. \"I don't think we're going to have years of 'New York variants' and 'California variants'\", says Barrett. Figuring out what is happening will depend not only on sequencing more samples but also on building the capacity to understand them. \"The US must do a better job along these lines,\" says Ho.\n\nReference\n1.

The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P.1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines.\n\nNew data suggest that in many recovered patients, immunity to earlier versions of the virus will not afford immunity to P.1. Researchers tested the neutralizing ability of antibodies in plasma samples taken from survivors of COVID-19 caused by earlier versions of the virus. The plasma \"had 6-fold less neutralizing capacity\" against the P.1 variant than against earlier virus versions, the researchers reported on Monday [1 Mar 2021] ahead of peer-review on a preprint server belonging to The Lancet journal (1). \"Lower neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and partial immunity against new variants suggests that reinfection could occur in convalescent or even vaccinated individuals,\" the authors said.\n\nIn a separate paper posted on Wednesday [3 Mar 2021] on medRxiv ahead of peer review, some of the same researchers estimated that among every 100 survivors of COVID-19 due to earlier virus versions, 25 to 60 could become reinfected if exposed to the P.1 variant because their antibodies could not protect them. As of Thursday [4 Mar 2021], according to the US Centers for Disease Control [and] Prevention, there have been 13 cases of COVID-19 due to P.1 in the United States.\n\nReference\n1. de Souza WM, Amorim MR, Sesti-Costa R, et al.

Murray had until recently been hopeful that the discovery of several effective vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity, or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection.\n\nBut in the last month [February 2021], data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected. \"I couldn't sleep\" after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. \"When will it end?\" he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants' ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week.\n\nA new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year [2020] of 2 vaccines with around 95% efficacy against COVID-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been.\n\nBut, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil has undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come.\n\nAs a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during COVID-19 surges, especially for people at high risk. Even after vaccination, \"I still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said in an interview. \"All you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction\" about when life gets back to normal.\n\nSome scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And, scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system's ability to combat the virus.\n\nAlready, COVID-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the 1st groups of people to be vaccinated.\n\n[Murray's] institute's current forecast, which runs to 1 Jun 2021, assumes there will be an additional 62 000 US deaths and 690 000 global deaths from COVID-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the [variants first detected in South Africa and Brazil].\n\nThe shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world's strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives.\n\nUS government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues \"Green Pass\" immunity documents to people who have recovered from COVID-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theaters. The documents are valid for only 6 months because it's not clear how long immunity will last.\n\n\"What does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?\" [asked] Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of COVID-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. \"In my mind, it's that hospitals aren't full, the ICUs aren't full, and people aren't tragically passing,\" he said.\n\nFrom the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target. Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and \"may never go away,\" including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies programme. Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year?\n\nFor much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly. At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn't expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate COVID-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough.\n\n\"We all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those 1st vaccines,\" said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. \"We didn't necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that 1st generation.\"\n\nThe optimism proved short-lived. In late December [2020], the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil.\n\nPhil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November [2020] that the US drugmaker's vaccine success signaled the virus was \"vulnerable to immunization\" in what he called \"a breakthrough for humanity.\" By early January [2021], he acknowledged the variants heralded \"a new chapter\" in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines.\n\nIn late January [2021], the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax's clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89% effective in a UK trial, but just 50% effective at preventing COVID-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the [variant first detected in South Africa].\n\nThe most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as \"scientific whiplash\": In December [2020], he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called \"functional eradication\" of the coronavirus, similar to measles.\n\nNow, \"getting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on 1 Dec 2020 or 1 Jan 2020,\" Crotty said, \"but the expected outcome isn't the same.\"\n\n[Byline: Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n----\n[E] Global COVID forecast\nDate: Thu 4 Feb 2021 20:32 EST\nSource: Cision PR Newswire [edited]\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ihme-extends-covid-19-forecasts-to-june-1--predicting-over-3-5-million-deaths-globally-301222821.html\n\n\nThe latest COVID-19 forecasts from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine predict more than 3.5 million deaths globally by 1 Jun 2021. The United States is expected to see a death toll of 631 000 by 1 Jun 2021. Increasing mask use to 95% in the United States could save 44 000 lives between now and 1 Jun 2021.\n\n\"There are serious concerns that with the spread of new COVID-19 variants, achieving herd immunity necessary to end the pandemic may be difficult if not impossible,\" said Dr. Christopher Murray, IHME director. \"We may be able to bring COVID-19 under control if we continue to focus on the strategies that can keep transmission low -- avoiding gatherings, wearing masks, and other measures -- while working to get as many people vaccinated as possible.\"\n\n\"The emerging variants of COVID-19 are showing us more about the effectiveness of vaccines as well as the strength of natural immunity from previous infections,\" said Murray. \"We are closely monitoring the clinical trial results as new findings could have significant bearing on the trajectory of the pandemic, which we will reflect in our model.\"\n\n\"While previous infections may not be effective at blocking the transmission of emerging variants, there are clear indications that the vaccines may still prevent from half to two-thirds of severe cases and deaths from such variants,\" said Murray.\n\nBetween now and 1 Jun 2021, 110 countries are expected to see high or extreme stress on intensive care units due to COVID-19. If people who are vaccinated return to normal levels of mobility, 17 states in the United States and 13 countries in Europe could see an increase in daily deaths in April and May [2021].\n\nIHME's projections are based on an epidemiological model that includes data on cases, deaths, and antibody prevalence, as well as location-specific COVID-19 testing rates, vaccination rollout, mobility, social distancing mandates, mask use, population density and age structure, and pneumonia seasonality, which shows a strong correlation with the trajectory of COVID-19.\n\nThe new projections for all countries are available at https://covid19.healthdata.org/.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The bottom line is the more sequencing done, the more mutations are detected and new variants are named. This makes it particularly difficult to predict the trajectory of cases in the future because some variants are more likely to evade neutralization by antibody from previous infections or vaccines. Furthermore, we do not have a clear understanding of the impact of all the mutations detected on infectiousness and transmissibility of the strains. But clearly some mutations have lent an advantage to the virus, and these strains can spread rapidly absent masks and social distancing. The greater the proportion of individuals vaccinated, the slower the virus will spread with fewer naive people available, and the fewer opportunities the virus will have to mutate. This is the way to slow down the case trajectory. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA: mask mandates, on-premises dining impact\nDate: Fri 5 Mar 2021\nSource: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm?s_cid=mm7010e3_w\n\n\nCitation: Guy GP Jr, Lee FC, Sunshine G, et al.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. Epub 5 Mar 2021. http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3\n\nSummary\nWhat is already known about this topic?\nUniversal masking and avoiding nonessential indoor spaces are recommended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nMandating masks was associated with a decrease in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation. Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with an increase in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41-100 days after implementation and an increase in daily death growth rates 61-100 days after implementation.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nMask mandates and restricting any on-premises dining at restaurants can help limit community transmission of COVID-19 and reduce case and death growth rates. These findings can inform public policies to reduce community spread of COVID-19.\n\n---\nCDC recommends a combination of evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1 [see source URL for complete references, figure, and tables]). Because the virus is transmitted predominantly by inhaling respiratory droplets from infected persons, universal mask use can help reduce transmission (1). Starting in April [2020], 39 states and the District of Columbia (DC) issued mask mandates. Reducing person-to-person interactions by avoiding nonessential shared spaces, such as restaurants, where interactions are typically unmasked and physical distancing (6 ft or more) is difficult to maintain, can also decrease transmission (2). In March and April 2020, 49 states and DC prohibited any on-premises dining at restaurants, but by mid-June [2020], all states and DC had lifted these restrictions. To examine the association of state-issued mask mandates and allowing on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths during 1 Mar 2020-31 Dec 2020, county-level data on mask mandates and restaurant reopenings were compared with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates relative to the mandate implementation and reopening dates. Mask mandates were associated with decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after implementation. Allowing any on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after reopening, and increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 61-80 and 81-100 days after reopening. Implementing mask mandates was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas reopening restaurants for on-premises dining was associated with increased transmission. Policies that require universal mask use and restrict any on-premises restaurant dining are important components of a comprehensive strategy to reduce exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). Such efforts are increasingly important given the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States (3,4).\n\nDiscussion\nMask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation. Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with increases in county-level case and death growth rates within 41-80 days after reopening. State mask mandates and prohibiting on-premises dining at restaurants help limit potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, reducing community transmission of COVID-19.\n\nStudies have confirmed the effectiveness of community mitigation measures in reducing the prevalence of COVID-19 (5-8). Mask mandates are associated with reductions in COVID-19 case and hospitalization growth rates (6,7), whereas reopening on-premises dining at restaurants, a known risk factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (2), is associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, particularly in the absence of mask mandates (8). The current study builds upon this evidence by accounting for county-level variation in state-issued mitigation measures and highlights the importance of a comprehensive strategy to decrease exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Prohibiting on-premises restaurant dining might assist in limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, such orders might disrupt daily life and have an adverse impact on the economy and the food services industry (9). If on-premises restaurant dining options are not prohibited, CDC offers considerations for operators and customers which can reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 in restaurant settings (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/business-employers/bars-restaurants.html). COVID-19 case and death growth rates might also have increased because of persons engaging in close contact activities other than or in addition to on-premises restaurant dining in response to perceived reduced risk as a result of states allowing restaurants to reopen. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of a multicomponent community mitigation strategy on economic activity.\n\nIncreases in COVID-19 case and death growth rates were significantly associated with on-premises dining at restaurants after indoor or outdoor on-premises dining was allowed by the state for more than 40 days. Several factors might explain this observation. Even though prohibition of on-premises restaurant dining was lifted, restaurants were not required to open and might have delayed reopening. In addition, potential restaurant patrons might have been more cautious when restaurants initially reopened for on-premises dining but might have been more likely to dine at restaurants as time passed. Further analyses are necessary to evaluate the delayed increase in case and death growth rates.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[If only politicians could read and understand studies like this. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[3] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 5 Mar 2021)\nDate: Fri 5 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 5 Mar 2021 15:31 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 648 543 (6276) / 29 444 (96)\nEuropean Region (61): 39 418 631 (178 102) / 878 731 (3098)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 632 174 (25 474) / 209 729 (303)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 552 836 (35 508) / 146 546 (444)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 51 158 352 (173 607) / 1 227 085 (5456)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 878 680 (6708) / 73 012 (164)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 115 289 961 (425 675) / 2 564 560 (9561)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 5 Mar 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20update%205%20Mar%202021_1614977184.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 40.8% of daily case numbers and 57.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 51.15 million cases.

The whole of West Africa finds itself in a delicate situation, with a real risk of a resurgence of the Ebola epidemic 5 years after a 1st deadly wave that left more than 11 000 dead.\n\nBetween March 2014 and December 2015, a national epidemic due to the Ebola virus was declared in Guinea (a resurgence was recorded in 2016 in the prefecture of Nzerekore, but it was quickly contained). The disease then spread very quickly to neighboring countries, notably Liberia and Sierra Leone, with 10 066 and 12 666 cases, respectively. Faced with the rapid spread of the virus, movement restrictions had been imposed, borders closed, and air links suspended.\n\nThis year [2021], the virus appeared in the sub-prefecture of Gouecke, a locality with high mobility towards the regional capital, Nzerekore. Being an agroforestry production area, the movement of people and products is a major risk factor for the spread of the disease. Already, a contact of patient zero has been identified in Conakry: he would have previously traveled a distance of about a thousand kilometers (about 620 mi). This means that the risk of the virus spreading to other prefectures or other countries is real. It is this fear that motivates the closure of borders and the slowdown in trade and tourism flows.\n\nAt the end of the 2014 epidemic, Guinea had carried out an analysis of the risks of epidemics and disasters that populations could face. This analysis highlighted the significant risk of a resurgence of certain diseases, in particular that caused by the Ebola virus. In total, 9 priority zoonotic diseases (rabies, anthrax, Ebola, dengue, brucellosis, avian influenza, yellow fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever) have been identified and placed under surveillance within the framework of the One Health integrated approach. It is therefore not surprising that the Ebola virus is now resurfacing in Guinea.\n\nAt the end of the epidemic in 2016, the Guinean government set up the National Health Security Agency (ANSS), the national institution in charge of managing epidemics, emergencies and health disasters. The agency has been provided with 38 epidemic treatment centers for the management of cases of diseases with epidemic potential, in accordance with the administrative subdivision of the country. For the management of epidemic cases in the communities, 17 improved health centers were built.\n\nThe national capacity in terms of laboratories and logistics has been improved. The country now has a network of 5 certified laboratories in Conakry, capable of detecting the main diseases with epidemic potential. Two local laboratories have been set up in the prefectures of Gueckedou and Kindia. The means of transport (motorcycles and cars) have been reinforced to ensure better mobility of the intervention teams.\n\nFor emergency interventions in the response to epidemics, the management of the agency has been decentralized. In addition to the national management, epidemic alert and response teams have been set up at the level of regions (regional epidemic alert and response teams [ERARE]) and prefectures (prefectural epidemic alert and response teams [EPARE]). The capacity of the vaccination teams has been strengthened for the implementation of screening activities.\n\nThe experiences of the response to the 2014 epidemic and the participation of Guinean teams in the response to Ebola in the DRC have strengthened national capacities in terms of epidemic management.\n\nThe principle of responsiveness in interventions is one of the lessons learned from the management of past epidemics. Epidemics spread quickly, with lots of rumors supporting them. The ANSS has already acquired the vaccines to prevent the spread of the virus. The epidemic treatment centers are on alert. With the experience resulting from the management of COVID-19, a videoconferencing system has been set up to coordinate interventions in the different prefectures. Measures have also been implemented to mobilize and involve community nationals in crisis management alongside the ANSS.\n\nThe media are also called upon to counter rumors about the existence of the disease, about preventive behavior or even those linked to the involvement of political authorities. To do this, information on the epidemic is regularly shared with them through the social networks of the agency to which they are members.\n\nThe 2014 epidemic was marked by the persistence of community reluctance. These take the form of the refusal to identify contact persons; hiding and/or caring for the sick in the community; transporting and cleaning the bodies of people who have died from Ebola; exposure for funeral orations of suspected or proven bodies; unsafe community burials; refusal to allow Red Cross agents to disinfect places believed to be infected, etc.; and verbal and physical violence against actors who do not share these beliefs. This reluctance, whatever its form and nature, is due to ignorance of the disease, received ideas and intervention errors by actors.\n\nIt has often happened that it was not the messages that were the problem, but the people who conveyed them. People often tend not to trust people outside their own community. Likewise, the hasty recruitment of inexperienced young people into communities is not without consequences. It was observed during the 2014 epidemic that the protocols for appointing members of community teams (village/neighborhood watch committees) were not respected. The new recruits lacked legitimacy, motivation and availability. The actions they carried out were not based on any result indicator. The gender dimension has often been ignored in the constitution of community teams.\n\nIt has been observed that contact persons leave their homes as soon as (a) the monitoring agents are not trustworthy and are considered as strangers in the locality; (b) the disease considered fatal is associated with their locality; (c) the contact is gossiped or stigmatized. Often, people fleeing their locality will already have developed 3 types of fears that will encourage them to leave: fear of suffering the same fate as the deceased, fear of going to the Ebola Treatment Center (CTE) considered as a dying [place], and fear of stigma. Taxi drivers are the 1st accomplices of people who secretly leave their communities.\n\nThe Ebola death management system disrupts funeral practices. As a result, cases of community deaths are not reported to allow dignified and secure care (DHS) by specialists. The populations accused the agents in charge of the DHS of not being reactive enough. This poses the problem of the conservation of bodies. Also, families reserve the \"sacred\" duty to wash the body for the 1st time before community rituals.\n\nFinally, the massive deployment of agents and vehicles for the response in the same place at the same time provokes a feeling of invasion among the populations. This spirit of competition between the partners in the response is detrimental to the spirit of teamwork and sharing.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[The report includes a France24 video, between Paris and Conakry; see the source URL.

In addition, 3 Public Health Emergency Operations Centers were activated with IOM's support to facilitate coordination and intensive contact tracing efforts.\n\n\"Since 2014, IOM has had a strong working relationship with national and local health authorities, communities, and other key stakeholders,\" said Maximilian Diaz, IOM Guinea's Officer in Charge. \"We were able to mobilize our teams immediately and help activate strong disease surveillance measures around the epicentre, but much more is needed to make sure the outbreak is contained as fast as possible.\"\n\nIOM's response strategy will focus on the Gouecke sub-prefecture, the current epicentre, and the surrounding health districts of the N'Zerekore region, which borders Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The Organization carried out preparedness activities in those countries following the 2014 EVD outbreak and is now planning to scale up efforts, including working with public authorities and communities to enhance surveillance at border areas, outreach to inform and engage communities, deployment of additional handwashing stations, and more.\n\nIOM's public health interventions use analysis of human mobility within and across international borders to inform targeted preparedness and response measures to infectious disease outbreaks. The Organization's new plan, in line with the Government's priorities laid out in the National EVD Response Plan, aims to prevent further EVD transmission by:\n\n- strengthening coordination and emergency management capacities at all levels;\n- carrying out disease surveillance activities;\n- implementing infection prevention and control measures, for example, by setting up handwashing stations;\n- and mapping local mobility trends and dynamics to inform decision-making.\n\nOverall, some 4.5 million people are targeted to benefit from these activities.\n\nAs of 1 Mar [2021], 4 probable and 13 confirmed cases have been identified, 8 of whom have died. As IOM-supported surveillance activities are already underway, hundreds of contacts have been identified, the majority of which are in N'Zerekore, and some others in the Conakry, Dubreka and Coyah areas. Despite some movement restrictions across official border crossings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of cross-border movements continue to take place, which pose a risk for international EVD spread.\n\n\"We have witnessed the devastation that delayed action on public health emergencies can do to a community and societies at large,\" stressed Diaz. \"We must stand by the people of Guinea, and we must act fast.\"\n\nIOM's Global Crisis Response Platform provides an overview of IOM's planned activities and funding requirements to respond to the evolving needs and aspirations of those impacted by, or at risk of, crisis and displacement in 2021 and beyond. The Platform will be regularly updated with new crisis response plans published over the coming weeks.\n\nIn line with the 2005 International Health Regulations, IOM uses a mobility-focused approach to public health preparedness and response to infectious diseases, through analysis of the way people travel, with interventions at points of entry, along transit corridors and in congregation spaces.\n\nThe aim is to strengthen systems to ensure cases are detected early through health screening points, contact tracing, and community-based mechanisms, targeting locations where the risks are the highest, to ultimately prevent transmission.\n\nIn addition, in contexts where access to clean water can be challenging, IOM works to improve people's abilities to wash their hands -- a key aspect of effective EVD and COVID-19 infection prevention -- for example, by rehabilitating boreholes, installing portable handwashing stations, and distributing hygiene kits with soap, among other things.\n\nIn recent years, IOM has implemented Ebola-related interventions across a dozen countries -- including Burundi, the DRC, Guinea, Liberia, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Uganda -- to mitigate in-country and cross-border infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[\"Established in 1951, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is the leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration and is committed to the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society.

Because only vaccination can allow us to end very quickly with this Ebola virus. It is for this reason that I am asking the population to take more responsibility and to cooperate fully in order to break all forms of reluctance.\"\n\nFor the moment, Guinee News could not know the

It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is very encouraging news. Concern has been high that the variants will escape neutralization in vaccinated and previously infected people. But T cell responses are important to disease resolution and this study suggests they will likely be equally effective in controlling disease following infection with mutants as with wild type virus. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Brazil: crisis, death surge\n[A] Crisis\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: The New York Times [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/world/americas/brazil-covid-variant.html\n\n\nCOVID-19 has already left a trail of death and despair in Brazil, one of the worst in the world. Now, a year into the pandemic, the country is setting another wrenching record. No other nation that experienced such a major outbreak is still grappling with record-setting death tolls and a healthcare system on the brink of collapse. Many other hard-hit nations are, instead, taking tentative steps toward a semblance of normalcy. But Brazil is battling a more contagious variant that has trampled one major city and is spreading to others, even as Brazilians toss away precautionary measures that could keep them safe.\n\nOn Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], Brazil recorded more than 1700 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day toll of the pandemic. \"The acceleration of the epidemic in various states is leading to the collapse of their public and private hospital systems, which may soon become the case in every region of Brazil,\" the national association of health secretaries said in a statement. \"Sadly, the anemic rollout of vaccines and the slow pace at which they're becoming available still does not suggest that this scenario will be reversed in the short term.\"\n\nAnd the news just got worse for Brazil -- and possibly the world. Preliminary studies suggest that the variant that swept through the city of Manaus is not only more contagious, but it also appears able to infect some people who have already recovered from other versions of the virus. And the variant has slipped Brazil's borders, showing up in 2 dozen other countries and in small numbers in the United States.\n\nAlthough trials of a number of vaccines indicate they can protect against severe illness even when they do not prevent infection with the variant, most of the world has not been inoculated. That means even people who had recovered and thought they were safe for now might still be at risk, and that world leaders might, once again, be lifting restrictions too soon.\n\n\"You need vaccines to get in the way of these things,\" said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, speaking of variants that might cause reinfections. \"The immunity you get with your cemeteries running out of room, even that will not be enough to protect you.\"\n\nThat danger of new variants has not been lost on scientists around the world. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pleaded with Americans this week not to let their guards down. \"Please hear me clearly,\" she said. \"At this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we've gained.\"\n\nBrazilians hoped they had seen the worst of the outbreak last year [2020]. Manaus, capital of the northern state of Amazonas, was hit so hard in April and May [2020] that scientists wondered if the city might have reached herd immunity. But then in September [2020], cases in the state began rising again, perplexing health officials. An attempt by Amazonas governor Wilson Lima to impose a new quarantine ahead of the Christmas holiday was met with fierce resistance by business owners and prominent politicians close to President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBy January [2021], scientists had discovered that a new variant, which became known as P.1, had become dominant in the state. Within weeks, its danger became clear as hospitals in the city ran out of oxygen amid a crush of patients, leading scores to suffocate to death.\n\nSince then, the coronavirus crisis has eased somewhat in Amazonas, but worsened in most of Brazil.\n\nScientists have scrambled to learn more about the variant and to track its spread across the country. But limited resources for testing have kept them behind the curve as they try to determine what role it is playing. Anderson Brito, a Brazilian virologist at Yale University, said his lab alone sequenced almost half as many coronavirus genomes as all of Brazil had. While the United States has done genetic sequencing on roughly one in 200 confirmed cases, Brazil sequences about one in 3000.\n\nThe variant spread quickly. By the end of January [2021], a study by government researchers found it was present in 91 percent of samples sequenced in the state of Amazonas. By the end of February [2021], health officials had reported cases of the P.1 variant in 21 of 26 Brazilian states, but without more testing, it is hard to gauge its prevalence.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, researchers have said that COVID-19 reinfections appear to be extremely rare, which has allowed people who recover to presume they have immunity, at least for a while. But that was before P.1 appeared and doctors and nurses began to notice something strange.\n\nJoao Alho, a doctor in Santarem, a city in Para, a state that borders Amazonas, said that several colleagues who recovered from COVID-19 months ago had fallen ill again and tested positive.\n\nJuliana Cunha, a nurse in Rio de Janeiro who has been working at COVID-19 testing centers, said she assumed she was safe after catching the virus last June [2020]. But in November [2020], after experiencing mild symptoms, she tested positive again. \"I couldn't believe it,\" Ms Cunha, 23, said. \"It must be the variants.\"\n\nBut there is no way to be sure what is happening to people who are reinfected unless both their old and new samples are kept, genetically sequenced, and compared.\n\nOne way to tamp down the surge would be through vaccinations, but the rollout in Brazil, as in so many countries, has been slow. Brazil began vaccinating priority groups, including health care professionals and the elderly, in late January [2021]. But the government has failed to secure a large enough number of doses. Wealthier countries have snapped up most of the available supply, while Mr Bolsonaro has been skeptical both of the disease's impact and of vaccines.\n\nJust over 5.8 million Brazilians -- roughly 2.6 percent of the population -- had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], according to the health ministry. Only about 1.5 million had received both doses. The country is currently using the Chinese-made CoronaVac -- which laboratory tests suggest is less effective against P.1 than against other variants -- and the one made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.\n\nMargareth Dalcolmo, a pulmonologist at Fiocruz, a prominent scientific research center, said Brazil's failure to mount a robust vaccination campaign set the stage for the current crisis. \"We should be vaccinating more than a million people per day,\" she said. \"That is the truth. We aren't, not because we don't know how to do it, but because we don't have enough vaccines.\"\n\nOther countries should take heed, said Ester Sabino, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Sao Paulo who is among the leading experts on the P.1 variant. \"You can vaccinate your whole population and control the problem only for a short period if, in another place in the world, a new variant appears,\" she said. \"It will get there one day.\"\n\nHealth minister Eduardo Pazuello, who called the variant a \"new stage\" of the pandemic, said last week [week of 23 Feb 2021] that the government was ramping up its efforts and hopes to vaccinate roughly half of its population by June [2021] and the rest by the end of the year [2021].\n\nBut many Brazilians have little faith in a government led by a president who has sabotaged lockdowns, repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, and promoted untested remedies long after scientists said they clearly did not work. Just last week, the president spoke dismissively of masks, which are among the best defenses to curb contagion, claiming that they are harmful to children, causing headaches and difficulty concentrating.\n\nMr Pazuello's vaccine projections have also been met with skepticism. The government last week placed an order for 20 million doses of an Indian vaccine that has not completed clinical trials. That prompted a federal prosecutor to argue in a legal filing that the USD 286 million purchase \"puts millions of lives at risk.\" Even if it proves effective, it will be too late for many.\n\n[Byline: Manuela Andreoni and Ernesto Londono from Rio de Janeiro; Leticia Casado from Bras\u00edlia. Carl Zimmer contributed reporting from New Haven, Connecticut]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The Brazilian health care system clearly is in a dire situation, with the variant(s) circulating, the low proportion of the population vaccinated, lack of oxygen, insufficient numbers of beds, and people encouraged not to wear masks. There needs to be a global effort to get Brazilians and members of other low- and middle-income countries vaccinated. Immunization needs to be global to be effective. If the virus is transmitted at a high rate in such countries as Brazil, more mutations will occur leading to a greater chance of spread. The best path forward to protection from the virus and its variants, along with masks and physical distancing, is immunization of the population. - Mod.LK]\n\n----\n[B] Deaths surge\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: Al Jazeera and News agencies [edited]\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/3/brazil-hits-record-number-of-daily-covid-deaths\n\n\nBrazil on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021] posted its highest number of deaths from COVID-19 in a single day as political infighting exacerbated the country's health crisis and the pace of its vaccination roll-out faltered. Some 1641 people died from COVID-19 on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], according to Health Ministry data, surpassing the previous single-day high of 1595 deaths recorded in late July 2020. More than 257 000 people have died of the disease in Brazil, making it the deadliest outbreak in the world after the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has pushed Brazil's hospital system to the brink of collapse, and state governors are now joining together to buy vaccines and bypass the federal government, which has been slow to roll out its vaccine programme. Brazil has continued to have a piecemeal response to the deadly disease, with individual cities and states setting their own policies in the face of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's repeated attacks on restrictive measures and face masks. Last week [week of 23 Feb 2021], Bolsonaro disparaged the use of face masks, saying they could lead to headaches and a \"decreased perception of happiness.\" He had also threatened to cut funding to cities and states that adopt stricter lockdowns.\n\nRoughly 10.6 million people of the country's 212 million population have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the pandemic began, according to the Health Ministry, with 59 925 new cases reported on Tue [2 Mar 2021].\n\nSam Cowie, a journalist based in Sao Paulo, described the situation as a \"bleak and scary time\". The pressure on the health system is so acute that, during the weekend [27-28 Feb 20201], at least 5 COVID-19 patients died while waiting for hospital beds, in Sao Paulo's neighbouring state of Santa Catarina, Cowie told Al Jazeera. \"What we are seeing here is an absolute health catastrophe, and that is exacerbated by the new variant first detected in Manaus,\" he said.\n\nBrazil began its vaccination programme in mid-January [2021], but is behind schedule on a government pledge of immunising the entire population by the end of the year [2021]. Only 3 percent of the country's population has been vaccinated, according to the latest official statistics.\n\nExperts have warned that if Brazil is unable to control the spread of the COVID-19, it could become the epicentre of the mutation of the virus, which could potentially be more infectious and lethal.\n\nThe coronavirus variant that was first identified in Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon towards the end of last year [2020] triggered a renewed wave of cases that left the city's hospitals without oxygen in January [2021].\n\nResearch is currently underway to test the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccines against the variant, which has prompted countries to close their borders to people travelling from Brazil.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Case studies on the impact of the \"politics of health\" will hopefully provide good lessons learned to prevent these situations from arising in the future. Brazil is not the only country to suffer from the negative impact of politics as the investigative journalists have shown. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[3] Obesity: impact on prognosis\nDate: Thu 4 Mar 2021\nSource: Al Jazeera [edited]\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/4/study-suggests-strong-link-between-obesity-and-covid-death-rate\n\n\nThe death rate from COVID-19 is about 10 times higher in countries where half or more of the population is overweight, according to a report by the World Obesity Federation.\n\nThe report released on Wednesday [3 Mar 2021] titled COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas has shown that being overweight is a \"highly significant predictor\" of developing complications from contracting COVID-19 such as hospitalisation, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation, as well as being a \"predictor of death\" from the disease. The researchers say that countries in which fewer than 40 percent of people are overweight had fewer coronavirus-linked deaths, whereas countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy, where more than 50 percent of the population is overweight, had a much higher death rate. \"An overweight population is an unhealthy population, and a pandemic waiting to happen,\" the report said.\n\nThe report flagged that in the UK, 73.7 percent of 10 465 patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 were overweight or obese. Meanwhile, Viet Nam has the lowest level of overweight people in the population and the world's 2nd lowest COVID death rate. It also highlighted that overweight and obesity could be risk factors for dangerous outcomes in people under 60 years old, with those who have a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 34 twice as likely to be admitted to ICU compared with the ones with a BMI under 30.\n\n\"Reducing one major risk factor, overweight, would have resulted in far less stress on health services and reduced the need to protect those services from being overwhelmed,\" the report found, suggesting that people who are obese or overweight should be prioritised for testing and vaccination.\n\nA survey last month [February 2021] by the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the obesity rate in the United States was 42 percent, higher than the 40 percent found in a 2015-16 study. COVID-19 has killed more than 500 000 people in the US so far and 2.56 million across the world.\n\nInformation collected over the past 2 decades has also shown that excess body weight is linked to worse outcomes in MERS, H1N1 influenza, and other influenza-related infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An excellent discussion of the impact of obesity on COVID was published in 2020. See:\n\nWadman M. Why obesity worsens COVID-19. Science. 2020 Sep 11;369(6509): 1280-1281. doi: 10.1126/science.369.6509.1280. PMID: 32913079.\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1280.full (abridged, edited)\n\n\"Since the pandemic began, dozens of studies have reported that many of the sickest COVID-19 patients have been people with obesity. In recent weeks, that link has come into sharper focus as large new population studies have cemented the association and demonstrated that even people who are merely overweight are at higher risk. For example, in the 1st meta-analysis of its kind, published on 26 Aug 2020 in Obesity Reviews, an international team of researchers pooled data from scores of peer-reviewed papers capturing 399 000 patients. They found that people with obesity who contracted SARS-CoV-2 were 113% more likely than people of healthy weight to land in the hospital, 74% more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and 48% more likely to die. (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200826083015.htm)\n\n\"A constellation of physiological and social factors drives those grim numbers. The biology of obesity includes impaired immunity, chronic inflammation, and blood that's prone to clot, all of which can worsen COVID-19. And because obesity is so stigmatized, people with obesity may avoid medical care.\n\n\"We didn't understand early on what a major risk factor obesity was. ... It's not until more recently that we've realized the devastating impact of obesity, particularly in younger people,\" says Anne Dixon, a physician-scientist who studies obesity and lung disease at the University of Vermont. That \"may be one reason for the devastating impact of COVID-19 in the United States, where 40% of adults are obese.\"\n\n\"People with obesity are more likely than normal-weight people to have other diseases that are independent risk factors for severe COVID-19, including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. They are also prone to metabolic syndrome, in which blood sugar levels, fat levels, or both are unhealthy and blood pressure may be high. A recent study from Tulane University of 287 hospitalized COVID-19 patients found that metabolic syndrome itself substantially increased the risks of ICU admission, ventilation, and death.\n\n\"But on its own, \"BMI [body mass index] remains a strong independent risk factor\" for severe COVID-19, according to several studies that adjusted for age, sex, social class, diabetes, and heart conditions, says Naveed Sattar, an expert in cardiometabolic disease at the University of Glasgow. \"And it seems to be a linear line, straight up.\"\n\n\"The impact extends to the 32% of people in the United States who are overweight. The largest descriptive study yet of hospitalized US COVID-19 patients, posted as a preprint last month [August 2020] by Genentech researchers, found that 77% of nearly 17 000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were overweight (29%) or obese (48%). (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines overweight as having a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kilograms per square meter, and obesity as a BMI of 30 or greater.)\n\n\"Another study captured the rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations among more than 334 000 people in England. Published last month [August 2020] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [2020 Sep 1;117(35):21011-21013. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2011086117. Epub 2020 Aug 11; https://www.pnas.org/content/117/35/21011.long], it found that although the rate peaked in people with a BMI of 35 or greater, it began to rise as soon as someone tipped into the overweight category (see graphic at URL above). \"Many people don't realize they creep into that overweight category,\" says 1st author Mark Hamer, an exercise physiologist at University College London.\n\n\"The physical pathologies that render people with obesity vulnerable to severe COVID-19 begin with mechanics: Fat in the abdomen pushes up on the diaphragm, causing that large muscle, which lies below the chest cavity, to impinge on the lungs and restrict airflow. This reduced lung volume leads to collapse of airways in the lower lobes of the lungs, where more blood arrives for oxygenation than in the upper lobes. \"If you are already starting [with] this mismatch, you are going to get worse faster\" from COVID-19, Dixon says.\n\n\"Other issues compound these mechanical problems. For starters, the blood of people with obesity has an increased tendency to clot--an especially grave risk during an infection that, when severe, independently peppers the small vessels of the lungs with clots (Science, 5 Jun 2020; 368 (6495: 1039; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/1039). In healthy people, \"the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels are normally saying to the surrounding blood: 'Don't clot,'\" says Beverley Hunt, a physician-scientist who's an expert in blood clotting at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London. But \"we think that signaling is being changed by COVID,\" Hunt says because the virus injures endothelial cells, which respond to the insult by activating the coagulation system. Add obesity to the mix, and the clotting risk shoots up. In COVID-19 patients with obesity, Hunt says, \"You've got such sticky blood, oh my -- the stickiest blood I have ever seen in all my years of practice.\"\n\n\"Immunity also weakens in people with obesity, in part because fat cells infiltrate the organs where immune cells are produced and stored, such as the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus, says Catherine Andersen, a nutritional scientist at Fairfield University. \"We are losing immune tissue in exchange for adipose tissue, making the immune system less effective in either protecting the body from pathogens or responding to a vaccine,\" she says.\n\n\"The problem is not only fewer immune cells but less effective ones, adds Melinda Beck, a co-author of the Obesity Reviews meta-analysis who studies obesity and immunity at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Beck's studies of how obese mice respond to the influenza virus demonstrated that key immune cells called T cells \"don't function as well in the obese state,\" she says. They make fewer molecules that help destroy virus-infected cells, and the corps of \"memory\" T cells left behind after an infection, which is key to neutralizing future attacks by the same virus, is smaller than in healthy weight mice.\n\n\"Beck's work suggests the same thing happens in people: She found that people with obesity vaccinated against flu had twice the risk of catching it as vaccinated, healthy weight people. That means trials of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 need to include people with obesity, she says, because \"coronavirus vaccines may be less effective in those people.\"\n\n\"Beyond an impaired response to infections, people with obesity also suffer from chronic, low-grade inflammation. Fat cells secrete several inflammation-triggering chemical messengers called cytokines, and more come from immune cells called macrophages that sweep in to clean up dead and dying fat cells. Those effects may compound the runaway cytokine activity that characterizes severe COVID-19. \"You end up causing a lot of tissue damage, recruiting too many immune cells, destroying healthy bystander cells,\" says Ilhem Messaoudi, an immunologist who studies host responses to viral infection at the University of California, Irvine. Of the added risk from obesity, she adds: \"I would say a lot of it is immune-mediated.\"\n\n\"The severity of COVID-19 in people with obesity helps explain the pandemic's disproportionate toll in some groups. In American Indians and Alaska Natives, for example, poverty, lack of access to healthy food, lack of health insurance, and poor exercise opportunities combine to render \"rates of obesity ... remarkably high,\" says Spero Manson, a Pembina Chippewa who is a medical anthropologist at the University of Colorado's School of Public Health. And obesity \"is connected to all these other [illnesses], such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, rendering us susceptible\" to severe COVID-19, Manson says.\"\n- Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 4 Mar 2021)\nDate: Thu 4 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 4 Mar 2021 16:02 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 642 203 (5308) / 29 346 (102)\nEuropean Region (61): 39 229 992 (182 418) / 875 330 (3436)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 606 700 (25 481) / 209 426 (533)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 517 328 (34 771) / 146 102 (436)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 50 984 745 (159 934) / 1 221 629 (5670)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 871 972 (8285) / 72 848 (204)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 114 853 685 (416 197) / 2 554 694 (10 381)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 3 Mar 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20update%204%20Mar%202021_1614894125.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 38.4% of daily case numbers and 54.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 50.98 million cases.

It is the 1st patient with the Congo virus reported this year.\n\n\"The patient has been a cowherd and resident of Bilawal Chowrangi in Karachi,\" Dr Jamali said.\n\nThe patient was brought to Jinnah Hospital over symptoms of Congo fever. The hospital confirmed Congo virus in the patient after medical test reports. A Congo virus alert had been issued last year [2020] for the metropolis, stipulating precautionary instructions for all those people who were visiting cattle farms. The alert was issued by the KMC [Karachi Metropolitan Corporation] to hospitals, directing them to adopt special precautions for a Congo-affected patient. It had further asked hospitals to establish special wards for Congo patients, and run awareness campaigns about the virus.\n\nThe disease is caused when a tick attaches itself to the skin of [infected] cattle and when that infected tick or animal comes in contact with people, the highly contagious virus is transmitted into the human body and the person falls ill. The initial symptoms of Congo fever included headache, high fever, rashes, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The CCHF virus is tick-borne and can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.

The majority of CCHF cases are reported in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, butchers, veterinarians, and on account of exposure in healthcare facilities among healthcare workers who are in contact with suspected CCHF cases.\n\nCCHF cases in Pakistan show biannual peaks, between the months of March-May and August-October. Many factors, including poor sanitation, unhygienic transportation, and numerous animal slaughter sites, inefficient tick-control programs, post-slaughter piles of animal remains, nomadic lifestyle, and lack of general awareness, contribute to the spread of CCHF.\n\nThe health and veterinary (including entomologists/vector control) sectors need to work together on formulating awareness messages to reach the susceptible groups in the general public, especially the high-risk groups, in order to minimize exposures. - Mod.UBA\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map of Pakistan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/947]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (07): Pakistan (Punjab) 20200917.7780237\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (05): Pakistan (SD, PB) RFI 20200815.7681654\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (02): Pakistan (SD) 20200331.7166823\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia: Pakistan (SD) 20200323.7129631\n2019\n----\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (23): (SD) 20191020.6737424\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (22): Pakistan (NW) 20191006.6712338\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (21): (PB) fatal 20190929.6700413\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (20): Pakistan (SD), India (RJ) 20190915.6674502\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (19): Pakistan (BA) India (RJ) 20190904.6656201\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (18): India (GJ) fatal 20190902.6648234\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (17): United Arab Emirates (SH) 20190829.6641849\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (16): Pakistan (SD, PB) 20190826.6640846\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (15): Pakistan (SD, BA) 20190821.6632745\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (10): Pakistan (BA) 20190728.6592620\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia: Pakistan (SD) 20190212.6311669\n2018\n----\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (21): (KP) 20181210.6202743\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (20): 2015-2018 20181110.6137319\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (10): (PB) 20180821.5975931\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (05): (PB) update 20180508.5789417\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (04): (SD) 20180506.5786591\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (03): (PB) update 20180427.5771054\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (02): (PB) 20180424.5766580\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan: (PB) 20180407.5732040\n20180510.5791413\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India: (GJ) susp. 20180402.5724054\n2017\n----\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (19): (NW) 20171102.5419698\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (18): (SD) 20171022.5395569\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (17): (BA) 20171009.5367524\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (16): (BA) RFI 20171008.5365206\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (15): (SD) 20170924.5337360\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (10): (PB) advice issued 20170821.5261727\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan: (IS) susp., not 20170316.4904498\n2016\n----\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India (07): (GJ) 20160930.4521944\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India (06): (GJ) Kutch, RFI responses, rebuttal 20160609.4274264\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India (05): (GJ) Kutch, RFI responses 20160605.4266148\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India: (GJ) 20160213.4018938\n2015\n----\nCrimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever - India (08) (GJ) 20151102.3760346\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India (07) 20151007.3696368\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - Eurasia: future risk 20150930.3679955\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India (06): (GJ) 20150824.3598944\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India (05): (GJ) 20150718.3520171\nCrimean-Congo hem. fever - India: (RJ) 20150128.3124546\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/uba/mj/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8228894", "headline": "Flavescence doree, grapevine - Germany: (RP)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8228894", "date": "2021-03-04 21:29:02", "main_text": "FLAVESCENCE DOREE, GRAPEVINE - GERMANY: (RHINELAND-PALATINATE)\n**************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: February 2021\nSource: European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) Reporting Service 02/2021/040 [abridged, edited]\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/reporting/article-6979\n\n\nIn Germany, grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma (EPPO A2 List) was first recorded in one grapevine plant (_Vitis vinifera_) in 2014 [ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025] and declared eradicated in 2017 (EPPO RS 2014/202, 2017/135). The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Germany informed EPPO that the pathogen was found again at the end of 2020 in one plant (_V. vinifera_) in a vineyard in Rheinland-Pfalz. The identity of the pathogen was confirmed by molecular methods.\n\nDue to the advanced age of the vines, it is excluded that the planting material could be the source of the infestation. It is assumed that the source is an _Alnus_ [alder] stand near the vineyard. The vector _Scaphoideus titanus_ is not present in Germany, but the pathogen may be transmitted from alders to grapevines by cicadas. Official eradication measures will be taken. The whole plot (1 ha, approximatively 3000 plants) will be destroyed. Intensive surveys for flavescence doree and its vectors will be conducted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was first reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the United States, the home of its primary vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group. Until recently, the only known natural hosts were _Vitis vinifera_ and hybrids, as well as some wild _Vitis_ species as asymptomatic infections.\n\nSymptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced, and some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.\n\nFD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material, and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).\n\nIn Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed. The vector was reported to have overcome the Alps in the mid 1990s. The 1st report of FD from Germany in 2014 was suspected to have been due to a quarantine incursion from infected Italian rootstocks (ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025) and was the 1st report of FD north of the Alps. FD has since then also been detected north of the Alps in Switzerland (ProMED-mail post 20190107.6246980) and Austria, where it was also detected in ornamental _Clematis_ species (see link below). The _S. titanus_ vector has been reported in Madeira (see links below) and Russia (ProMED-mail post 20200909.7763574), but so far not the phytoplasma. The spread of FD in central Europe is considered another example of \"warm climate diseases\" moving into cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED-mail post 20141024.2895414).\n\n\"Eradication\" of pathogens or diseases, particularly once they are established in the field (as had been claimed in Germany for FD above), has hardly ever been successful in the past and should never be relied on as a tool for disease management. Furthermore, proof of absence of a pathogen is principally and practically impossible, because it would require that each and every known or potential host, symptomatic or not, as well as all known and potential vectors or pathogen reservoirs are tested with a method that has a 100% rate of reliability.\n\nMaps\nGermany (with states):\nhttp://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/germany.jpg\nEurope, overview:\nhttp://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/europe_95.jpg\n\nPictures\nFlavescence doree, various grapevine cultivars:\nhttps://bit.ly/2SEcflW,\nhttps://live.staticflickr.com/1478/26546310526_09d79fc749_b.jpg,\nhttps://cdn.unitycms.io/image/ocroped/1200,1200,1000,1000,0,0/9r2R23KvzkM/2a6SZSJsKli9Nwr-fkSvWb.jpg,\nhttps://rebschutzdienst.at/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Flavescence.jpg and\nhttp://b-c-ing-u.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-Vine-leaves-attacked-by-the-Flavescence-Dor%C3%A9e-photo-X.jpg\nFD affected vineyards:\nhttps://www.grab.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FlavescenceDor%c3%a9e.jpg,\nhttps://www.mon-viti.com/sites/default/files/images/flavescence_cabernet_s1.jpg and\nhttps://charente.chambre-agriculture.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Nouvelle-Aquitaine/096_Inst-Charente/Documents/PRODUIRE/VITICULTURE/FLAV_DOREE/VITI_FlavescenceD2.jpg\n_S. titanus_ vector:\nhttp://www1.pms-lj.si/animalia/media/Scaphoideus-titanus/Scaphoideus-titanus_049a_GSeljak.jpg (adult) and\nhttps://www.stop-flavescence-bourgogne.fr/assets/files/images/vecteur/cicadelle%20verte%20+%20cicadelles%20FD.jpg (larvae)\n\nLinks\nInformation on FD:\nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/T0675E/T0675E0a.htm#Flavescence%20dor%C3%A9e,\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHYP64 (with pictures),\nhttps://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/diseases/flavescence_dor233e,\nhttps://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/26184, via\nhttp://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/plaveg/pestrava/graphy/tech/graphye.shtml and\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-0119-3_5\nFD alternative host clematis:\nhttp://www.bulletinofinsectology.org/pdfarticles/vol64-2011-s223-s224reisenzein.pdf\nFD vector Madeira:\nhttps://gd.eppo.int/reporting/article-6966 and\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epp.12683\nFD phytoplasma taxonomy:\nhttp://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/131152\nInformation on _S. titanus_ vector:\nhttps://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/48854 and\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/260450322_Biology_and_ecology_of_the_Flavescence_doree_vector_Scaphoideus_titanus_A_review\nPhytoplasma resource centre:\nhttps://plantpathology.ba.ars.usda.gov/phytoplasma.html\nEPPO A2 quarantine list:\nhttp://www.eppo.int/QUARANTINE/listA2.htm\n- Mod.DHA]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nPhytoplasmas, grapevine & pome fruit - Russia: surveys 20200909.7763574\n2019\n----\nFlavescence doree, grapevine - Switzerland: (GE) 20190107.6246980\n2017\n----\nFlavescence doree, grapevine - France: (AR) 20171121.5455770\nFlavescence doree, grapevine - Switzerland: (VD) 20170320.4914128\n2014\n----\nFlavescence doree, grapevine - Germany: 1st report (RP) 20141217.3038025\n2011\n----\nFlavescence doree, grapevine - Austria, Switzerland 20110122.0273\n2010\n----\nFlavescence doree, grapevine - Switzerland: update 20100206.0405\n2008\n----\nAster yellows phytoplasma, grapevine - South Africa: update 20080519.1666\n2004\n----\nGrapevine flavescence doree, status - France 20040105.0042\nGrapevine yellows phytoplasmas, new data, EPPO 20040104.0037\n2003\n----\nPhytoplasmas, fruit trees, grapevine - Albania 20030819.2083\nGrapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma - Italy & Serbia 20030717.1754\nElm yellows phytoplasma, grapevine - Serbia 20030523.1261\nGrapevine yellows - France 20030315.0641\n1997\n----\nGrapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma - Spain 19970725.1561\n.................................................dha/tw/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8228499", "headline": "African swine fever - Asia (05): China (YN) domestic, spread, pathogenicity", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8228499", "date": "2021-03-04 18:28:28", "main_text": "AFRICAN SWINE FEVER - ASIA (05): CHINA (YUNNAN) DOMESTIC, SPREAD, PATHOGENICITY\n*******************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: Financial Post [abridged, edited]\nhttps://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/china-confirms-swine-fever-in-piglets-in-yunnan-province\n\n\nOn 3 Mar 2021, an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] has been confirmed in piglets being illegally transported through Funing county in China's southwestern province of Yunnan, the farm ministry said. The case comes amid growing concern that a severe wave of disease in recent months has hit China's hog herd, the world's largest. Six out of the 36 pigs had died, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement late on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], while 6 more in the truck were sick.\n\nBeijing reports few disease outbreaks on Chinese farms, but some analysts have recently estimated that about 1/5 of the breeding herd in northern China was affected over the winter.\n\nAfrican swine fever is usually fatal to pigs, but recent studies have identified some less lethal variants circulating in China [see comment].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The information above about the less lethal ASF variants in China has been recently subject to a scientific study published in a Chinese journal (reference below). From the said paper, we introduce the abstract and selected segments from the discussion chapter:\n\n1. Abstract\n\n\"African swine fever virus (ASFV) has been circulating in China for more than 2 years, and it is not clear whether the biological properties of the virus have changed. Here, we report on our surveillance of ASFVs in 7 provinces of China, from June to December 2020. A total of 22 viruses were isolated and characterized as genotype II ASFVs, with mutations, deletions, insertions, or short-fragment replacement occurring in all isolates compared with Pig/HLJ/2018 (HLJ/18), the earliest isolate in China. Eleven isolates had 4 different types of natural mutations or deletion in the EP402R gene and displayed a non-hemadsorbing (non-HAD) phenotype. Four isolates were tested for virulence in pigs; 2 were found to be as highly lethal as HLJ/18. However, 2 non-HAD isolates showed lower virulence but were highly transmissible; infection with 10^6 TCID50 dose was partially lethal and caused acute or sub-acute disease, whereas 10^3 TCID50 dose caused non-lethal, sub-acute or chronic disease, and persistent infection. The emergence of lower virulent natural mutants brings greater difficulty to the early diagnosis of ASF and creates new challenges for ASFV control.\"\n\n2. Discussion (selected segments; for the omitted references, please refer to the full paper)\n\n\"Genotype II ASFV strains, which are endemic in Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and other Southeast Asia regions, mainly exhibit high virulence in pigs, except for isolates Estonia/WB/2014 and Lv17/WB/Rie1. Estonia/WB/2014 was isolated from wild boar in Estonia in 2014 and had a deletion of 14 560 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end. Animal studies showed that the Estonia/WB/2014 was lethal in wild boar, but did not kill any domestic pigs, although the infected domestic pigs developed disease signs, including lethargy, reduced feed intake, and fever. Lv17/WB/Rie1 was isolated from a hunted wild boar in Latvia in 2017, had a nucleotide deletion at site 395 of its EP402R gene, which caused the loss of expression of CD2v, and had reduced virulence in domestic pigs. In the present study, the 11 non-HAD mutants detected in China have 4 different kinds of genetic changes in the EP402R gene, which all resulted in the deletion of the CD2v protein. Although we only tested and confirmed the partial attenuation of 2 viruses in pigs, it is reasonable to speculate that all of the 11 non-HAD viruses are partially attenuated in pigs. These facts indicate that ASFVs may lose CD2v protein through different strategies during their circulation in pigs, which is probably a compromise of ASFVs to the host's antiviral response, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear.\n\n\"Currently, there are no commercial vaccines or specific treatments available for ASF. Therefore, control of the disease relies on the rapid diagnosis and culling of infected animals. The emergence of the non-HAD mutants will cause more problems and pose bigger challenge for the ASF control in China since they cause a much more delayed course, and mild, chronic disease signs, while being continuously shed via the oral and rectal routes. Recently, we developed a safe and efficient 7-gene-deleted live vaccine (HLJ/18-7GD) based on HLJ/18. The protective efficacy of the HLJ/18-7GD vaccine against these newly emerged, lower virulent strains need to be urgently evaluated.\"\n\nOn top of ASF, which reportedly started its circulation in China in August 2018, China's livestock industry has been plagued by 2 other recently introduced viral diseases that are high on OIE's list of transboundary animal diseases, namely lumpy skin disease in cattle and PPR [peste des petits ruminants] in small ruminants (sheep and goats). Fortunately, and in difference with ASF, potent vaccines against these 2 diseases are commercially available.\n\nReference:\n\nEncheng Sun, Zhenjiang Zhang, Zilong Wang, Xijun He, et al.: Emergence and prevalence of naturally occurring lower virulent African swine fever viruses in domestic pigs in China in 2020.

The 6th took a home test but did not fill in the necessary form. \"Incidents like this are rare and only occur in around 0.1% of tests,\" he told MPs in the House of Commons. \"We've identified the batch of home test kits in question, our search has narrowed from the whole country down to 379 households in the south-east of England and we're contacting each one.\"\n\nHancock also said that a 3rd vaccine might be necessary in the autumn, against P1 and similar variants such as B1351, which was 1st detected in South Africa. Both have mutations in the spike protein that can help virus variants escape the current vaccines.\n\n\"Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we're working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil, so we're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation,\" said Hancock.\n\nThe international team of scientists that detected P1 in Manaus is calling for more genetic sequencing of emerging variants around the world, saying that only with knowledge of how Sars-Cov2 is mutating can the pandemic be brought under control.\n\nThe variant, called P1, not only has potential to evade the immune protection of previous illness or vaccines, but is more transmissible than the original coronavirus. The study in Manaus, which has not yet been published in peer-reviewed form, found it was about 1.4 to 2.2 times more transmissible than the original virus.\n\nThe scientists said at a briefing that 6 cases, detected promptly in the UK, did not presage a significant spread of the variant. It was vital, however, to identify variants emerging throughout the world in countries that had little or no genomic sequencing capacity at the moment, they said.\n\nThe research was carried out by the Brazil-UK Cadde project, whose work on genetic sequencing predates the pandemic. It includes the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Sao Paulo, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and universities in Oxford, London and Birmingham.\n\nManaus, the largest city in the Amazon basin, suffered a 1st wave of Covid in April/May [2020]. Studies of blood donors suggested 66% of people had antibodies against the virus in July [2020] and 76% by October [2020], which would have been expected to give them immunity. But the city suffered a serious 2nd wave. There could have been various explanations, including the possibility that the data on previous infection was wrong, but the team of researchers identified the P1 variant on [6 Dec 2020]. It spread rapidly: within 8 weeks, it was implicated in 87% of cases.\n\nDr. Nuno Faria of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said it had concluded that the variant was causing people who had already suffered from Covid to get it again. \"If 100 people were infected in Manaus last year [2020], somewhere between 25 and 61 of them are susceptible to reinfection by P1,\" he said at a briefing. \"We caution, however, that our results from analysis should not be generalised to other epidemiological contexts and/or other variants of concern.\"\n\nProf. Sharon Peacock, the director of Cog-UK, the consortium responsible for the genomic sequencing of the virus and its variants, said P1 has spread to 25 countries to date. \"It is being distributed around the world. But I would say that in terms of the UK, we have just 6 cases identified, which we heard about yesterday [Mon 1 Mar 2021] from Public Health England, and from the government,\" she said.\n\nPeacock expressed a note of caution about the findings from Manaus. \"We need to see whether this is generalisable to other settings, she said. \"So I think it would be wise to indicate that this is relevant to where the study was done, but we don't know how that will pan out in other countries, including the UK.\n\n\"The response that we've taken in the UK has been very brisk, and is appropriate, but very vigorous.\" Public Health England was investigating the 6 known cases of people infected with P1, tracing contacts and taking appropriate action, she said.\n\nThe research shows that P1 has 17 mutations and many are similar to those found in the spike protein of the variant found in South Africa, called B1351. In particular, a mutation called E484K that they share appears to enable the variants to escape the immune system, which means that vaccines may have reduced efficacy.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Boseley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Also review; Genomics and epidemiology of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Manaus, Brazil https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CADDE-CENTRE/Novel-SARS-CoV-2-P1-Lineage-in-Brazil/main/manuscript/FINAL_P1_MANUSCRIPT_25-02-2021_combined.pdf. - Mod.UBA]\n\n----\n[B] South Africa\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttps://jp.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-safrica/south-african-scientists-find-antibodies-from-variant-may-offer-cross-protection-idUSKCN2AV1SK\n\n\nResearch by South African scientists suggests that antibodies triggered by exposure to the country's dominant coronavirus variant can prevent infection by other variants, the scientists said on [Wed 3 Mar 2021].\n\nThe findings in laboratory studies offer hope that COVID-19 vaccines based on the 501Y.V2 variant 1st identified late last year [2020] could protect against multiple variants circulating in different parts of the world.\n\nThe more contagious variant drove a 2nd wave of infections in South Africa that peaked in January [2021] and is believed to have spread to many other countries in Africa and other continents.\n\n\"We used plasma ... from people that were infected in this latest wave with the 501Y.V2 and we used it against the 1st-wave virus, ... what we found is that it could neutralise, OK not as well as it could neutralise itself but it's not bad at all,\" Alex Sigal from the Africa Health Research Institute told a news conference. Sigal said vaccines designed with the 501Y.V2 variant in mind \"might be cross-protective to other variants, ... this gives you some idea how this problem of variants can be solved\".\n\nPenny Moore, a professor at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said the antibody response from the 501Y.V2 variant was only reduced 3-fold against the 1st-wave virus, whereas the response from the 1st-wave virus was reduced 9-fold against 501Y.V2.\n\n\"It's not that the antibodies that are triggered by 501Y.V2 are somehow magical, there is a drop-off, ... but unlike the antibodies triggered by the original variant they seem to somehow have a little bit more breadth,\" she told the same briefing.\n\nSalim Abdool Karim, a top government adviser on COVID-19, said major vaccine manufacturers including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson were already making vaccines based on the 501Y.V2 variant. Moderna had already adapted its shot and was putting it into human studies, he added.\n\nHe predicted that by the end of 2021 most vaccine manufacturers would have adapted their shots, \"not because they are specifically worrying about the virus coming from South Africa ... but because key mutations in the 501Y.V2 are actually also present in many other variants.\"\n\nHealth Minister Zweli Mkhize said the research was encouraging and that genomics surveillance had helped the government respond to the pandemic.\n\nSouth Africa has recorded by far the most COVID-19 infections and deaths on the African continent, at 1.5 million cases and over 50 000 fatalities to date.\n\n[Byline: Alexander Winning]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Also review; Escape of SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variants from neutralization by convalescent plasma\nhttps://www.ahri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/MEDRXIV-2021-250224v1-Sigal.pdf - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[3] Prevalence of COVID-19-related symptoms by age group\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: LitCovid [edited]\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/33650071\n\n\nref: Unim B, Palmieri L, Lo Noce C, Brusaferro, S and Onder, G.

PMID: 33650071; PMCID: PMC7919615.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has caused over 95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2 million deaths worldwide. According to current literature data, older adults have higher risk of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19. It is also known that older adults often do not present typical symptoms of diseases. The aim of the study was to assess if the prevalence of typical COVID-19-related symptoms varies by age group.\n\nMethods\nMedical charts of a random sample of COVID-19 patients dying in-hospital were retrieved through an integrated national surveillance system and reviewed by a group of researchers at the Italian National Institute of Health. Detailed information on COVID-19-related symptoms were extracted and analyzed.\n\nResults\nA total of 3241 confirmed cases of COVID-19-related deaths were identified from 4391 reviewed medical charts. The mean number of COVID-19-related symptoms progressively declined with age, from 2.1 in patients aged under 60 years to 1.7 in those aged 90 years or older (p < 0.001). Moreover, fever, cough, and diarrhea significantly declined with increasing age.\n\nConclusions\nOlder adults have atypical presentation of symptoms and may be paucisymptomatic. This may lead to a diagnostic and therapeutic delay which aggravates the prognosis of COVID-19. Special attention should be posed when assessing individuals aged 65 years and older with suspected COVID-19.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Immune profiling in COVID-19 patients\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: LitCovid [edited]\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/33648924\n\n\nref: Schrijver B, Assmann JLJC, van Gammeren AJ, et al.

PMID: 33648924\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nCOVID-19 differs substantially between individuals, ranging from mild to severe or even fatal. Heterogeneity in the immune response against SARS-COV-2 likely contributes to this. Therefore, we explored the temporal dynamics of key cellular and soluble mediators of innate and adaptive immune activation in relation to COVID-19 severity and progression. A total of 44 patients with a PCR-proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Extensive cellular (leukocytes and T-lymphocyte subsets) and serological immune profiling (cytokines, soluble cell surface molecules, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) was performed at hospital admission and every 3-4 days during hospitalization. Measurements and disease outcome were compared between patients with an unfavorable (IC admission and/or death) and favorable (all others) outcome. Patients with an unfavorable outcome had higher leukocyte numbers at baseline, mostly due to increased neutrophils, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte numbers were reduced. CRP, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF levels were higher at baseline in the unfavorable group, whereas IL-7 levels were lower. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were more frequently absent in the unfavorable group. Longitudinal analysis revealed delayed kinetics of activated CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte subsets in the unfavorable group. Furthermore, whereas CRP, IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF declined in the favorable group, these cytokines declined with delayed kinetics, remained increased, or even increased further in the unfavorable group. Our data indicate a state of increased innate immune activation in COVID19-patients with an unfavorable outcome at hospital admission, which remained over time, as compared with patients with a favorable outcome.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 3 Mar 2021)\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 3 Mar 2021 16:18 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 636 896 (5059) / 29 244 (111)\nEuropean Region (61): 39 038 341 (167 303) / 871 340 (3645)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 581 219 (21 861) / 208 893 (305)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 482 557 (33 299) / 145 666 (398)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 50 824 766 (114 932) / 1 215 955 (3090)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 863 687 (5827) / 72 644 (267)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 114 428 211 (348 281) / 2 543 755 (7807)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 3 Mar 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2021%20WHO%20Daily%20Tables%20Mar3_1614861430.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 33% of daily case numbers and 39.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 50.82 million cases.

Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.8% increase in daily reported cases and a 12.4% increase in reported deaths.\n\nImpression: There were more than 465 000 newly confirmed infections reported globally in the past 24 hours with over 115.74 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.57 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the conclusion that advances in slowing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 are fading and transmission is increasing. - Mod.UBA]\nSee Also\nCOVID-19 update (85): USA challenges, Brazil reinfection, WHO 20210303.8224463\nCOVID-19 update (84): statin use, long haul flight transmission, WHO 20210302.8222190\nCOVID-19 update (83): summary tidbits, intellectual property, holistic model, WHO 20210301.8219679\nCOVID-19 update (82): mapping escape mutants, variants, vaccines, WHO, global 20210228.8218147\nCOVID-19 update (81): transmission, reinfection, vaccine and case severity, WHO 20210227.8216798\nCOVID-19 update (80): vaccine, USA variants, comments, WHO, global 20210226.8214650\nCOVID-19 update (70): gangrene, challenge trials, immunity, cancer, WHO, global 20210218.8198620\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, pangolin, bat 20210211.8184900\nCOVID-19 update (50): UK vaccine study, Brazil reinfection, WHO 20210205.8167161\nCOVID-19 update (01): variants, vaccine, Thailand, global, WHO 20210101.8062938\n2020\n----\nUndiagnosed pediatric inflammatory syndrome (06): COVID-19, heart, young adults 20200522.7364506\nCOVID-19 update (562): viral load, UK vacc dose, ECDC, WHO 20201231.8061525\nCOVID-19 update (01): China, global, EVZD, reporting criteria, WHO 20200213.6984084\nNovel coronavirus (42): China, global, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, WHO 20200211.6979942\nNovel coronavirus (01): China (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU) (10): genome available, Hong Kong surveill. 20200111.6883998\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (01): (HU) wildlife sales, market closed, RFI 20200102.6866757\n2019\n----\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/uba/mj/ao/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8228080", "headline": "Announcement: Opt-In coming soon for ProMED", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8228080", "date": "2021-03-04 15:11:24", "main_text": "ANNOUNCEMENT: OPT-IN COMING SOON FOR PROMED\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDear ProMED Subscriber,\n\nOver the next few weeks, the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) will be improving the mail-deliverability infrastructure for the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED).

Seroprevalence studies indicate CCPP presence in West Africa (though no sites in Morocco were evaluated). Given the OIE regulation of CCPP it is an important rule out.\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nMay Meghan\nUniversity of New England\nPortland, ME, USA\n<mmay3@une.edu>\n\n[CCPP is a severe disease of goats occurring in many countries in Africa and Asia; synonyms include pleuropneumonie contagieuse caprine (France), bou-frida (Algeria), and abu-nini (Sudan).\n\nPeracute, acute and chronic forms occur in endemic areas. In case of the peracute presentation, the affected goats may die within 1-3 days with minimal clinical signs. Diagnosis is carried out by clinical and necropsy observations that should be confirmed by laboratory tests. Post-mortem examination reveals fibrinous pleuropneumonia with massive lung hepatisation and pleurisy, accompanied by accumulation of straw coloured pleural fluid. CCPP is strictly a respiratory disease. One wonders if necropsies were undertaken in the event described.

Ministers and government representatives from Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone attended the inter-ministerial meeting.\n\n\"If in 2014 Guinea and the neighbouring countries were victims of Ebola, this time around Guinea and the region are resolutely facing up to Ebola,\" said H.E. the Prime Minister.\n\nThe ministers agreed in a final declaration to set up a coordination mechanism, enhance cross-border collaboration, including working with communities, to support the efforts in containing the virus. They also agreed to facilitate import regulations for vaccines and drugs as well as promote measures that were effective in bringing the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa under control.\n\nGuinea declared an outbreak on [14 Feb 2021] after cases were confirmed positive for Ebola in a rural community in N'Zerekore prefecture, which lies near the border with Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia. As of [2 Mar 2021], 17 cases (13 confirmed, 4 probable) had been reported.\n\n\"We are greatly encouraged by the common front taken by Guinea's neighbours to tackle this outbreak. We know from experience how much this is critical in fighting Ebola,\" said Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, Regional Emergency Director at the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa. \"With close cross-border trade and social ties, we cannot ignore the importance of regional approaches against health crises.\"\n\nIn support of Guinea's health authorities, WHO and partner organizations have ramped up response to the outbreak. Ebola vaccinations were launched just 9 days after the outbreak was declared. To date, 1317 people have been vaccinated and 32 000 vaccine doses have so far been delivered.\n\nAll the 6 countries bordering Guinea are stepping up readiness.

He made this call on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], during an exchange he had with them. According to the minister, during the epidemic period, some patients flee conventional structures to seek treatment from traditional healers.\n\n\"This is why we wanted to sound the alarm among traditional healers to be vigilant, especially since we have all been trained in integrated disease surveillance and response so that they can help us alert patients who show signs resembling Ebola and COVID-19. They understood the magnitude of the threat and promised to lend us a hand,\" said Dr Nzanzu Salita.\n\nExpressing their commitment to the fight against Ebola and COVID-19, these traditional healers pleaded for the provision of personal protective equipment, in order to protect themselves against Ebola in their various centers.\n\nThe provincial health minister has promised to find a solution to this request in the near future.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Bringing the traditional healers into the response to combat Ebola would be very helpful. But they are at high risk of infection when treating infected patients. If they could be provided with personal protective equipment, they would be less likely to become infected themselves and thus unlikely to transmit the disease to naive individuals who come to seek care or accompany those who do. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] Congo DR (North Kivu): 2 individuals cured\nDate: Wed 3 Mar 2021\nSource: Media Congo.net on Twitter [in French, machine trans., edited]\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/mediacongo/status/1367169904886054912\n\n\n#Butembo [North Kivu]: 2 people cured of Ebola virus disease officially left the Ebola treatment center on Wednesday [3 Mar 2021]. 11 cases have already been notified, with 4 deaths\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Seeing individuals released from treatment centers after recovering from Ebola is always a cause for celebration.

It might lead to heavy loss if the disease is not checked from spreading further. Observers claimed that leaf blight disease happens due to fungal infection and advised to use pesticide with constraint. They also advised to conduct awareness programme to sensitise the farmers about the disease.\n\nHowever, the [local] agriculture department has failed to be of any help. The farmers are also not seeking the assistance of farm experts to contain the disease. They are buying pesticide from the market. As a result, wrong use of pesticide results in crop loss and reduced output.\n\n[A] scientist at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra [agricultural extension centre] in Jajpur said that the disease has affected the crop as the farmers do not treat the seeds before cultivation. He advised farmers to treat seeds and contact the agriculture scientist before making use of pesticide on their crops.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A number of tomato diseases have been reported from the region; many of them can also affect potatoes and other solanaceous crops. Leaf blight symptoms, as mentioned above, can be due to a number of mainly fungal and bacterial pathogens. For example, late blight of tomato and potato (caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) is rife in the region, with a severe strain spreading there (ProMED-mail post 20180418.5755980). It is not clear whether this disease has been excluded as a possibility.\n\nThe problems above may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors. Reliable molecular diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the farmers. However, the recommendation above to make use of seed treatments and expert advice in the meantime is certainly sound.\n\nMaps\nIndia (with states):\nhttp://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm\nOdisha districts:\nhttps://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/orissa/orissa.htm\n\nPictures\nSymptoms of some tomato diseases via:\nhttp://www.ipmimages.org/browse/AreaSubs.cfm?area=63\n\nLinks\nList of major diseases and pathogens of tomato:\nhttps://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/resources/commonnames/Pages/Tomato.aspx\nFact sheets of some major tomato diseases via:\nhttp://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_List.htm\n- Mod.DHA]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nUndiagnosed disease, tomato - India (02): (MH) multiple viruses 20200528.7388319\nUndiagnosed disease, tomato - India: (MH) 20200514.7337673\n2019\n----\nUndiagnosed disease, tomato - Iraq: (BA) 20190116.6262560\n2018\n----\nLate blight, potato - India: strain Blue 13\n2017\n----\nUndiagnosed virus, tomato - India: (OR) 20171103.5421613\nUndiagnosed fungus, potato - Bangladesh: (DH) 20170203.4812065\n2016\n----\nTomato leaf curl virus, eggplant - India: (TN) 20160415.4160915\n2015\n----\nBuckeye & bacterial blight, tomato, capsicum - India: (HP) 20150721.3525025\nUndiagnosed disease, potato & tomato - Nepal: (BN) 20150115.3095471\n2013\n----\nYellow leaf curl & blights, tomato - Pakistan: (SD) 20130206.1531086\n2012\n----\nUndiagnosed disease, tomato - India: (UT) 20121213.1450713\n2011\n----\nUndiagnosed virus, chili - India: (GA) 20110408.1099\n2010\n----\nBacterial wilt, tomato - Uganda, Nepal 20101209.4386\nLate blight, seed potato, tomato - India: (HP) 20101015.3738\nBuckeye & bacterial blight, tomato - India: (HP) 20101001.3560\nLate blight, tomato - India: (UT) 20100121.0236\n2009\n----\nMultiple pathogens, tomato, capsicum, strawberry - India 20090622.2284\nand additional items on tomato diseases in the archives\n.................................................sb/dha/tw/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8225848", "headline": "Theileria - New Zealand: spread by sheep", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8225848", "date": "2021-03-03 18:13:55", "main_text": "THEILERIA - NEW ZEALAND: SPREAD BY SHEEP\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 22 Feb 2021 21:45 NZDT\nSource: New Zealand Herald [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/research-shows-sheep-may-help-spread-bovine-anaemia-parasite/CYVYYW6ZPT35XXN2TXOKRSWQLY/\n\n\nNew Zealand researchers have proven sheep can carry and potentially spread the parasite behind the bovine anaemia epidemic. Sheep were asymptomatic carriers of the tick-borne parasite _Theileria orientalis_, which meant they were unaffected by the disease but could spread it to the ticks feeding on them.\n\n_T. orientalis_ is a tickborne intracellular parasite of red blood cells causing severe and mild infections in various ruminants worldwide. To date [22 Feb 2021], there have been 11 types identified within this species, of which 4 types are presently found in New Zealand cattle, researchers said.\n\nSince 2012, New Zealand suffered a substantial epidemic of infectious bovine anaemia in both dairy and beef cattle associated with the Ikeda type. Researchers believed the speed at which the disease spread through the North Island suggested other species could have been involved in transmission.\n\nTherefore, the aim of a series of related experiments was to test the null hypothesis sheep can't maintain _T. orientalis_ Ikeda-type infection or infect ticks feeding on them. Several studies were conducted over 2 years to address this hypothesis.\n\nThe studies showed sheep can have detectable levels of _T. orientalis_ Ikeda-type infection, in both the acute and chronic phase, and _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ (also known as the Asian longhorned tick) larvae can become infected when feeding on sheep. Researchers recorded no anaemia, weight loss, or clinical disease in the sheep in the acute phase of infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Some North Island, as well as South Island, cattle are suffering anemia as the result of infection with a strain of the parasite _Theileria orientalis_, called Ikeda. The infection is spread by ticks.\n\n\"The intracellular protozoal parasite _Theileria orientalis_ ikeda has rapidly spread across southeastern Australia since 2006, causing deaths and production losses in cattle. The 3-host \"bush tick\" _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ (Neumann) appears the principal biological vector in the endemic regions. To generate sufficient numbers of ticks to produce stabilate for infection to confirm vector competency and for acaricide trials, the optimal conditions and stage-specific intervals for the generational lifecycle of _H. longicornis_ was defined on 2 dogs and 2 steers. To determine whether _H. longicornis_ was a definitive host for _T. orientalis_, nymphal stages were fed on a steer infected with _T. orientalis_ and moulted adults were permitted to feed for 3 days on an uninfected calf prior to harvest. Subsequent detection of infection after inoculation of 4 naive calves with stabilate produced from ground-up adult ticks or dissected salivary glands confirmed _H. longicornis_ as one final (definitive) host for _T. orientalis_ in Australia.\" (Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590138919300189).\n\nNow it seems we know this particular tick feeds on sheep with no ill effects to the sheep.\n\nThe issue first appeared in Northland in August 2012, and since then cases were found across the North Island but predominantly in the upper island. The bulk of cases appear in areas where ticks are very prevalent. It appears tick populations increased rapidly as a result of summer's drought [in 2013], and the mild winter might mean they survived and became active early during the 2014 season.\n\nIt now appears the sheep may be harboring the infective agent and passing it to the ticks. While this is great research, it is in some ways disheartening to realize the sheep may be the source of the situation. It seems keeping cattle and sheep treated with a tick control will be essential to the health of cattle. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nNew Zealand: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nTheileria, bovine - Australia, New Zealand: background 20151205.3841381\n2014\n----\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand (04): (South Island) 20141125.2987470\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand (03): (South Island) 20141108.2938293\nTheileria, bovine - Australia (02): (SA) 20141018.2876525\nTheileria, bovine - Australia: (VI) 20140823.2715493\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand (02) 20140621.2557021\nTheileria, cervid - China: (northwest) 20140516.2477057\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand 20140423.2422975\n2013\n----\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand (03) 20131123.2069997\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand (02) 20130925.1966132\nTheileria, bovine - New Zealand 20130922.1960608\nTheileria, bovine - Australia (02) 20130613.1769991\nTheileria, bovine - Australia 20130612.1768157\n2012\n----\nTheileria, bovine - Australia (03): (VI) 20120605.1156373\nTheileria, bovine - Australia (02): (VI) 20120604.1155307\nTheileria, bovine - Australia: (NS) 20120325.1080410\n.................................................sb/tg/rd/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8225738", "headline": "Undiagnosed deaths, goat - Morocco: (SS) RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8225738", "date": "2021-03-03 14:05:51", "main_text": "UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, GOAT - MOROCCO: (SOUSS-MASSA) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 2 Mar 2021\nSource: Hespress [in Arabic, trans.

Other etiologies to be considered, in all age groups, include anthrax and various toxic agents, among others.\n\nFor the location of the Moroccan province of Chtouka Ait Baha, situated within the Souss-Massa region, please go to https://goo.gl/maps/CKeQBy5SS76AFbZQA. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map of Morocco: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30671]\nSee Also\n2020\n----\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (03): human, animal, spread, WHO 20201114.7943971\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (02): animal, human, spread, Sudan susp 20201001.7828576\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: (BR, TG, HG) camelids, OIE 20200926.7813988\n2019\n----\nFoot & mouth disease - Morocco (02): livestock, st O, tt EA-3, spread, control 20190726.6589603\n2017\n----\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: RFI 20170605.5085590\n2015\n----\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania (03): ovine, caprine, OIE 20151107.3774473\nAnthrax - Morocco: (MA.MT) cutaneous, RFI 20150830.3611950\n.................................................sf/arn/mj/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8224463", "headline": "COVID-19 update (85): USA challenges, Brazil reinfection, WHO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8224463", "date": "2021-03-03 14:04:20", "main_text": "CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 UPDATE (85): USA CHALLENGES IN DISEASE CONTROL, BRAZIL REINFECTION, WHO, GLOBAL\n********************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] USA: challenges in disease control\n[2] Brazil: reinfection\n[3] WHO updates (as of 2 Mar 2021)\n[4] Global update: Worldometer accessed 2 Mar 2021 23:29 EST (GMT-5)\n\n******\n[1] USA: challenges in disease control\nDate: Mon 1 Mar 2021\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]\nhttps://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/even-3-vaccines-now-cdc-head-warns-possible-4th-covid-surge\n\n\nEven with 3 vaccines now, CDC head warns of possible 4th COVID surge\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOver the weekend [27-28 Feb 2021] both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave the green light to Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, making it the 1st one-dose option available to Americans. The newly approved vaccine is expected to arrive in arms as soon as tomorrow. A total of 4 million doses will be administered across the United States by the end of the week, Reuters reported. Johnson & Johnson previously said it aims to have 20 million doses delivered to Americans by the end of the month [March 2021], and 100 million doses by June [2021]\n\nBiden administration officials warned that availability of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be sporadic and limited, most likely until April [2021].\n\n'Very real threat' of variants\n------------------------------\nThe welcomed news of a 3rd COVID-19 vaccine was tempered today [1 Mar 2021] by warnings from CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, who said during a White House press briefing that recent declines in case counts are stalling. \"The most recent 7-day average of cases, approximately 67 200, represents an increase of a little over 2% compared to the prior 7 days,\" said Walensky. \"Please hear me clearly -- at this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained. These variants are a very real threat to our people and our progress.\"\n\nWalensky said the country cannot settle for 70 000 cases and 2000 deaths per day due to the virus. She also said if states lift mitigation mandates, like mask-wearing, too quickly, the nation could see a 4th wave of virus activity before enough Americans are vaccinated.\n\nYesterday [28 Feb 2021] the United States reported 51 204 new COVID-19 cases, and 1097 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, the country has 28 648 156 cases, including 514 216 deaths.\n\nThe latest CDC tracking on variants shows confirmed 2400 B.1.1.7 cases in 46 states, 53 B.1.351 cases in 16 states, and 10 P1 cases in 5 states.\n\nVaccine hesitancy among Black Americans\n---------------------------------------\nNew data from Rand Corporation shows Black Americans, including healthcare workers, report high levels of vaccine hesitancy.\n\nOnly 40% of Black Americans polled (out of 207) said they would definitely get a vaccine. Further, 1/3 of all survey participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, and an additional 25% said they did not know if they would get vaccinated.\n\nBlack Americans have been among the hardest-hit US groups during the pandemic, but government distrust and vaccine hesitancy remain a lingering problem.\n\nYesterday [28 Feb 2021], Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said all Americans should get whatever vaccine is made available to them as soon as possible, stressing that efficacy rates among the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are not comparable.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was 100% effective in preventing deaths, was less effective in preventing mild to moderate illness when compared with the mRNA vaccines but was tested when more variant strains were spreading, Fauci said yesterday on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"It's not the weaker vaccine. They are all 3 really good vaccines,\" Fauci said.\n\nIn other US news, the New York Times reports that, nationwide, COVID-19 testing is down by 30%, likely owing to fewer exposures, less travel after the holidays, the vaccine rollout, and pandemic fatigue.\n\n[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nClaudinne Miller\nTulane Outbreak News\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\n\n[Also see:\n\n- US COVID-19 cases caused by variants (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html; updated 2 Mar 2021)\n\"The emerging variants CDC is closely monitoring have mutations in the virus genome that alter the characteristics and cause the virus to act differently in ways that are significant to public health (for example, causes more severe disease, spreads more easily between humans, requires different treatments, changes the effectiveness of current vaccines). It's important to understand that genetic mutations are expected, and some variants can spread and become predominant while others subside.\"\n\n- The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/01/world/covid-19-coronavirus)\n\"From a high of nearly 14 million tests a week in early January [2021], the pace fell to fewer than 10 million -- a level not seen since October [2020] -- in the week ended [24 Feb 2021], according to the Covid Tracking Project.\n\n\"Some areas report even sharper declines.\n\n\"Experts cited a number of factors that could be contributing to the slump:\n- Fewer exposures. Since daily tallies of new coronavirus infections have fallen sharply, fewer people may be having contacts that would prompt them to seek a test.\n- Less travel. The holiday rush is over, reducing the need for people to get tested before or after trips.\n- Bad weather. The severe storms and Arctic temperatures that battered much of the country, from Texas to the Northeast, caused many testing sites to close temporarily.\n- The vaccine rollout. Some states have shifted their limited public health resources, and their public messaging, toward vaccination efforts at the expense of testing.\n- Pandemic fatigue. Some experts worry the decline may be yet another symptom of public exhaustion and frustration with pandemic precautions and safety measures.\"\n\nIt is important to the understanding of virus evolution and dynamics that testing continue. But the decrease is not surprising and probably is a result of a combination of the factors listed. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Brazil: reinfection\nDate: Sun 21 Feb 2021\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases [abridged, edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/5/21-0191_article\n\n\nref: Vasques Nonaka CK, Franco MM, Graf T, et al. Genomic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection involving E484K spike mutation, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2021 May [cited 2 Mar 2021]. doi: 10.3201/eid2705.210191\nOriginal publication date: [19 Feb 2021]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nUncertainty remains about how long the protective immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 persists, and suspected reinfection in recovered patients has been reported. We describe a case of reinfection from distinct virus lineages in Brazil harboring the E484K mutation, a variant associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies.\n\n-------\nA 45-year-old woman residing in Salvador (Bahia State, northeast Brazil) with no underlying conditions had symptoms of viral infection on 2 occasions (26 May 2020 and 26 Oct 2020). In the 1st episode, the patient had diarrhea, myalgia, asthenia, and odynophagia for approximately 7 days. She took 40 mg prednisone for 5 days and returned to normal activities 21 days later, after resolution of symptoms without sequelae or complaints. In the 2nd episode, which was symptomatically more severe in terms of intensity and duration, the patient had headache, malaise, diarrhea, cough, and sore throat that evolved to myalgia and ageusia, muscle fatigue, insomnia, mild dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath. In both episodes, however, disease was classified as mild, and she was treated at home, not requiring hospitalization.\n\nComparison of the phylogenetic profiles of the 2 new sequences with contemporaneous sequences from Brazil (Appendix Table, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/27/5/21-0191-App1.xlsx) clearly demonstrated that the 2 COVID-19 episodes, separated by a 147-day interval, were indeed caused by different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, confirming reinfection.\n\nThis reinfection case aligns with another reinfection recently described in Brazil in which a 1st infection with the B.1.1.33 lineage was followed by a 2nd one with the P.2 lineage (Resende PC et al, unpub. data, https://virological.org/t/spike-e484k-mutation-in-the-first-sars-cov-2-reinfection-case-confirmed-in-brazil-2020/584). The E484K mutation, located in the viral receptor binding domain, has been emerging independently in several SARS-CoV-2 variants, and its monitoring is of pivotal importance in the current stage of the pandemic.\n\nOur report of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with a E484K variant corroborates in vitro and in silico studies that estimated the potential of lineages carrying this mutation to escape from neutralizing antibodies and highlights the importance of genomic surveillance to detect and monitor the emergence of new viral linages with possible implications for public health policies and immunization strategies.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promdmail.org>\n\n[Also see Coronavirus reinfection will soon become our reality (https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/coronavirus-reinfection/618128/; 24 Feb 2021) for a basic discussion of re-infection.\n\n\"The coronavirus is very likely here to stay, even after the pandemic officially ends. The virus will continue to have opportunities to evolve; in its myriad forms, it will cross paths with many of us again and again. \"Reinfections are probably something we're going to have to get used to,\" [Brianne Barker, an immunologist at Drew University] said. But virus and human will grow accustomed to each other, reaching something of a d\u00e9tente; immunity will, over time, build like a seawall.\"\n- Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] WHO updates (as of 2 Mar 2021)\n[A] Weekly epidemiological update\nDate: Tue 2 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO Emergency Situational Updates [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---2-march-2021\n\n\n[References, figures, and tables available at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP]\n\nData as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [28 Feb 2021], 10 am CET\n\nGlobal overview\n---------------\nOver 2.6 million new cases were reported last week, a 7% increase compared to the previous week, following 6 consecutive weeks of declining numbers (Figure 1). The global case increase was driven by increases in the Eastern Mediterranean (14%), South East Asia (9%), Europe (9%), and the Americas (6%). Possible reasons for this increase include the continued spread of more transmissible variants of concern (VOCs), relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSM), and fatigue around adhering to PHSM measures. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response. For public health authorities, that means testing, contact tracing, isolation, supported quarantine and quality care. For individuals, it means avoiding crowds, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks and ventilation. Furthermore, immunity conferred by vaccination takes weeks at the individual level, and it may take longer to observe impacts at the population-level.\n\nThe number of global new deaths continues to decrease, with over 63 000 new deaths reported last week [week of 22 Feb 2021], a 6% decrease as compared to the previous week. New deaths decreased in 4 regions, Europe, Africa, the Western Pacific, and the Americas (by 15%, 19%, 35% and 1%, respectively), and increased by 47% in the South East Asia Region, partly due to retrospective reporting of deaths from Nepal. The Americas reported over 1.1 million new cases and nearly 34 000 deaths, which accounted for 42% of global cases and 53% of global deaths.\n\nIn the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the United States of America (472 904 new cases, a 2% decrease), Brazil (373 954 new cases, an 18% increase), France (149 959 new cases, a 14% increase), Italy (112 029 new cases, a 32% increase), and India (105 080 new cases, a 21% increase).\n\nFigure 1: COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO Region, and global deaths, as of [28 Feb 2021].\nFigure 2: COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories, and areas, [22 Feb 2021] through [28 Feb 2021].\nTable 1: Newly reported and cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, by WHO Region, as of [28 Feb 2021].\nAnnex 1: COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories, and areas, and WHO Region, as of [28 Feb 2021].\nAnnex 3: Data, table, and figure notes.\n\nSpecial focus: COVID-19 and international trade, travel, and points of entry\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is having, a substantial impact on international trade and travel. In 2020, world passenger traffic fell by 2.7 billion passengers, or by 60% compared to 2019, causing a USD 371 billion loss of gross passenger operating revenues of airlines /1. In addition to the economic loss, travel restrictions are also having a direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of transport workers, most notably in the maritime sector. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that around 400 000 seafarers have been stranded on board commercial vessels, long past the expiry of their contracts and unable to be repatriated. A similar number of seafarers urgently need to join ships to replace these individuals. /2\n\nWHO has been engaging with and supporting stakeholders in the travel sector across all points of entry (airports, ports, and ground crossings) since the start of the pandemic, and produced its 1st travel-related guidance in March 2020. All guidance documents can be found [at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance-publications].\n\nManaging the safe and effective recovery of international travel through a risk-based approach\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn December 2020, WHO published guidance for national authorities on a step-by-step approach to decision-making for calibrating public health risk mitigation measures for international travel in the context of COVID-19 [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Risk-based-international-travel-2020.1]. It is divided into 3 main sections: risk assessment, risk mitigation and risk communication. Key points include:\n- during the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel should always be prioritized for emergencies and humanitarian actions, travel of essential personnel, repatriations, and cargo transport for essential supplies such as food, medicines, and fuel;\n- as countries gradually resume international travel, introduction of risk mitigation measures aiming to reduce travel associated exportation, importation, and onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should not unnecessarily interfere with international traffic and should be based on a thorough risk assessment that is conducted systematically and routinely;\n- decision-makers in Member States can conduct risk assessments through a mixed-method approach (explained in the guidance and the accompanying risk assessment tool) to calculate the additional burden presented by possible importation of COVID-19 cases and decide policies on the basis of whether they have the capacity to cope with this burden;\n- international travellers should not be considered by nature as suspected COVID-19 cases or contacts. Therefore, WHO does not recommend travellers as a priority group for testing;\n- the use of \"immunity certificates\" for international travel in the context of COVID-19 is not currently supported by scientific evidence and is therefore not recommended by WHO; and\n- the overall health and well-being of communities should be at the forefront of considerations when deciding on and implementing international travel-related measures.\n\n[Also available at the source URL above:}\n- COVID-19 diagnostic testing in the context of international travel\n- Impact of new variants of concern on international travel restrictions\n- Considerations regarding COVID-19 vaccination for international travellers\n- Systematically reviewing the evidence available to inform and update WHO's travel guidance\n\nSpecial focus: the importance of fit, filtration and breathability of non-medical (fabric) masks in the context of COVID-19\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSince January 2020, WHO has recommended the use of masks as part of a comprehensive set of interventions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There are many commercial non-medical (also called fabric or cloth) masks available; however, the multitude of voluntary international standards together with the absence of regulatory oversight has made it difficult for people to know if their masks are effective barriers.\n\nWhen implemented with other public health and social measures, a mask can serve as an effective barrier to prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, provided that it fits well, has good filtration, and the wearer can easily breathe through it (Figure 3). When any of these 3 parameters are not optimized, the mask may be an ineffective barrier and/or uncomfortable to wear.\n\nGood fit means the mask fully covers the nose, mouth, and chin. There should be no leaks around the edges of the mask. The exhaled breath should be filtered through the surface of the mask.\n\nGood filtration means the mask has the right fabric or combination of fabrics that filter droplets present in exhaled air.\n\nGood breathability means the wearer can easily breathe through the material of the mask. Since masks are often rated in terms of their filtration, it is equally important to maximize breathability to ensure the wearer's comfort.\n\nWHO first issued guidance on the composition of non-medical or fabric masks in June 2020 providing specific recommendations about the number of layers, their composition and performance, and the importance of fit. Where possible, to ensure adequate wearer comfort, the design and combination of textiles used in manufacturing the fabric masks should be independently tested for adequate fit, filtration and breathability. This is especially important for masks used for an extended period of time and/or in humid environments.\n[More details at the source URL above.]\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of the 3 essential parameters of filtration, breathability, and fit.\n\nSpecial focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern\n-------------------------------------------------------\nWHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions, and researchers, continues to monitor the public health events associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and provides updates as new information becomes available. Further information on the background of the variants of concern (VOC) is available from previously published Disease Outbreak News and recent publications of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports]. Here we provide an update on the geographical distribution of 3 VOCs as reported by countries, territories, and areas (hereafter countries) as of [2 Mar 2021] (Table 2, Annex 2). This information should be interpreted with due consideration of limitations of ongoing surveillance, including but not limited to differences between countries in sequencing capacity and which samples are prioritized for sequencing. WHO continues to advocate for strengthening surveillance and sequencing capacity, and a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of variant transmission. New potential variants of interest (VOIs) or VOCs are currently under review and may be added to future updates.\n\nAlthough many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections likely as a result of the public health and social measures (PHSM) implemented and various vaccination programme implementations, there has been an increased number of reports of variants which are of concern. Many countries across all 6 WHO regions have started to report increases in new cases of COVID-19 in the past month [February 2021]. While it is difficult to ascertain the exact proportion of all new cases which may be attributable to VOIs and VOCs, summaries on the past week's updates on VOC 202012/01, 501Y.V2, and P.1 variants of concern are outlined below.\n\nTable 2: Key characteristics of circulating variants of concern (as of [1 Mar2021)]. Annex 2: List of countries/territories/areas reporting variants of concern as of [2 Mar 2021].\n\nProposed working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 VOIs and VOCs [see source URL above]\n\n1. Variant VOC 202012/01\nSince our last update on [23 Feb 2021], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 5 additional countries. As of [2 Mar 2021], a total of 106 countries across all 6 WHO regions have reported cases of this variant (Figure 4). Community transmission has been reported in at least 42 countries across 4 WHO regions, noting that transmission classification is currently incomplete for 35 (33%) countries reporting this variant.\n\nFigure 4: Countries, territories, and areas reporting VOC 202012/01, as of [2 Mar 2021].\n\n2. Variant 501Y.V2\nSince the last update on [23 Feb 2021], 501Y.V2 has been reported from 5 additional countries -- now totalling 56 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 5). Community transmission of 501Y.V2 has been reported in 8 countries across 3 WHO regions, noting the transmission classification is currently incomplete for 42 (75%) countries reporting this variant.\n\nFigure 5: Countries, territories, and areas reporting 501Y.V2, as of [2 Mar 2021].\n\n3. Variant P.1\nSince our last update, one country has corrected their reporting, and reporting from another amounted to one additional country. To date, this variant is reported in 29 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 6). Community transmission of P.1 has been reported in at least 3 countries in one WHO region, noting the transmission classification is currently incomplete for 9 (31%) countries reporting this variant.\n\nFigure 6: - Countries, territories, and areas reporting P.1, as of [2 Mar 2021]\n\nSituation by WHO Region\n-----------------------\n[Epidemic curves available for each region at the source URL above]\n\n- African Region\nIn the past week, the African Region reported over 50 000 new cases and 1500 new deaths, a 24% and 19% decrease respectively compared to the previous week. This represents the largest decline as a percentage in new cases and the 2nd largest decline of new deaths globally. In the region new cases in the past week rose in 17 of 49 (36%) countries and fell in 30 of 49 (64%). This week new deaths increased in 13 of 49 (28%) countries and declined in 24 of 49 (53%). The highest numbers of new cases were reported in South Africa (9858 new cases; 16.6 new cases per 100 000 population; a 20% decrease), Ethiopia (6196 new cases; 5.4 new cases per 100 000; a 1% increase), and Nigeria (3864 new cases; 1.9 new cases per 100 000; a 34% decrease). The same countries reported the highest number of new deaths in the past week: South Africa (1001 new deaths; 1.7 new deaths per 100 000; an 11% decrease), Ethiopia (83 new deaths; 0.1 new deaths per 100 000; an 8% decrease), and Nigeria (74 new deaths; less than 0.1 new deaths per 100 000; a 12% decrease).\n\n- Region of the Americas\nOver 1.1 million new cases and just under 34 000 new deaths were reported in the Region of the Americas this week, a 6% increase and 1% decrease respectively compared to the previous week. This represents the 1st rise in new cases since the week ending [10 Jan 2021]. This week, new cases rose in 22 of 56 (39%) countries and fell in 24 of 56 (43%). This week, new deaths increased in 11 of 56 (20%) countries and declined in 20 of 56 (36%). The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the United States of America (472 904 new cases; 142.9 new cases per 100 000 population; a 2% decrease), Brazil (373 954 new cases; 175.9 new cases per 100 000; an 18% increase), and Argentina (49 516 new cases; 109.6 new cases per 100 000; a 50% increase). The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the United States of America (14 866 new deaths; 4.5 new deaths per 100 000; a 1% increase), Brazil (8070 new deaths; 3.8 new deaths per 100 000; an 11% increase), and Mexico (5509 new deaths; 4.3 new deaths per 100 000; a 14% decrease).\n\n- Eastern Mediterranean Region\nIn the past week, the Eastern Mediterranean Region reported over 207 000 new cases, a 14% increase compared to last week. The region reported just over 2500 new deaths, a 5% increase. Across the region 14 of 22 (64%) countries reported increases in new cases and 8 of 22 (36%) declined this week. New deaths rose in 13 of 22 countries (59%) and fell in 7 of 22 (32%). The 3 countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases this week were the Islamic Republic of Iran (57 078 new cases; 68 new cases per 100 000 population; a 3% increase), Iraq (27 491 new cases; 68.3 new cases per 100 000; a 19% increase) and Jordan (26 685 new cases; 261.5 new cases per 100 000; a 78% increase). The highest numbers of new deaths this week have been reported in the Islamic Republic of Iran (571 new deaths; 0.7 new deaths per 100 000 population; a 9% increase), Lebanon (355 new deaths; 5.2 new deaths per 100 000; a 6% increase) and Egypt (341 new deaths; 0.3 new deaths per 100 000; a 6% decrease).\n\n- European Region\nThe European Region reported over 1 million new cases and over 21 000 new deaths, an increase of 9% and decrease of 15% respectively when compared to the previous week. This represents the 1st rise in new cases since the week ending [10 Jan 2021], and reverses declines made over the previous 2 reporting weeks. This week new cases rose in 36 of 61 (59%) countries and fell in 22 of 61 (36%) while new deaths rose in 16 of 61 countries (26%) and fell in 30 of 61 (49%). The 3 countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases were France (149 959 new cases; 229.7 new cases per 100 000; a 14% increase), Italy (112 029 new cases; 185.3 new cases per 100 000; an 32% increase), and Czechia [Czech Republic] (82 321 new cases; 768.7 new cases per 100 000; a 26% increase).

A global total of 9522 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 1 Mar 2021 to late 2 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include Brazil, USA, France, Italy (17 063), India (15 704), Czech Republic (12 191), Turkey (11 837), Sweden (11 804), and Russia (10 565). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 45 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and none from the African region. Spain has made some alterations in the daily case count so that today's (2 Mar 2021) total is 74 347 fewer than yesterday's (1 Mar 2021). Noteworthy is that Brazil reported more cases than the USA.\n\nComparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.6%. Given the decline in reported cases from Spain today (2 Mar 2021), I deleted Spain from the 7-day newly confirmed case count and the comparative 7-day change is an increase of 4.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 8.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 14.2% increase in reported deaths.\n\nImpression: The global daily reported cases totaled over 295 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 115.28 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.55 million reported deaths. The marked revision of reported case counts in Spain over the past 24 hours, combined with the recognized aberrant decrease in testing leading to lower reported cases in the USA makes one raise an eyebrow, but conclude that advances in slowing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 are fading and transmission is increasing. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nCOVID-19 update (84): statin use, long haul flight transmission, WHO 20210302.8222190\nCOVID-19 update (83): summary tidbits, intellectual property, holistic model, WHO 20210301.8219679\nCOVID-19 update (82): mapping escape mutants, variants, vaccines, WHO, global 20210228.8218147\nCOVID-19 update (81): transmission, reinfection, vaccine and case severity, WHO 20210227.8216798\nCOVID-19 update (80): vaccine, USA variants, comments, WHO, global 20210226.8214650\nCOVID-19 update (70): gangrene, challenge trials, immunity, cancer, WHO, global 20210218.8198620\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, pangolin, bat 20210211.8184900\nCOVID-19 update (50): UK vaccine study, Brazil reinfection, WHO 20210205.8167161\nCOVID-19 update (01): variants, vaccine, Thailand, global, WHO 20210101.8062938\n2020\n----\nUndiagnosed pediatric inflammatory syndrome (06): COVID-19, heart, young adults 20200522.7364506\nCOVID-19 update (562): viral load, UK vacc dose, ECDC, WHO 20201231.8061525\nCOVID-19 update (01): China, global, EVZD, reporting criteria, WHO 20200213.6984084\nNovel coronavirus (42): China, global, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, WHO 20200211.6979942\nNovel coronavirus (01): China (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU) (10): genome available, Hong Kong surveill. 20200111.6883998\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (01): (HU) wildlife sales, market closed, RFI 20200102.6866757\n2019\n----\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/mpp/lk/mpp/mj/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8225607", "headline": "Avian influenza (39): Ukraine (KS) wild bird, HPAI H5, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8225607", "date": "2021-03-03 14:03:22", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (39): UKRAINE (KHERSON) WILD BIRD, HPAI H5, OIE\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 25 Feb 2021\nSource: OIE, Disease Alerts, 2021 [edited] https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/CUTOVER_OIE-WAHIS/UKRAINE_HPAI-A_02032021.pdf\n\n\nHighly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds), Ukraine\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInformation received on 2 Mar 2021 from Svitlana Shlapatska, focal point for animal disease notification, Ukraine\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 28 Feb 2021\nDate of confirmation of the event: 1 Mar 2021\nReason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 12 Jan 2017\nManifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\nSerotype: H5\nNature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)\nThis event pertains to a defined zone within the country.\n\nNew outbreaks\nSummary of outbreaks\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak location: Kherson district, Kherson\nDate of start of the outbreak: 28 Feb 2021\nOutbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)\nEpidemiological unit: natural park\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\nMute swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / - / 21 / 21 / 0 / 0\nAffected population: 21 mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) were found dead on the territory of the natural park.\n\nEpidemiology\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species\nEpidemiological comments: a 3 km [1.8 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been established.

Some reactivated their local Ebola radio programs.\n\nRadio Soleil adapted its new health program King Afya (Swahili for \"Let's Preserve Good Health\") to respond to the outbreak. The program takes its inspiration from Internews' KomaEbola, a radio program on Ebola that was listened to by 68.8% of respondents in North Kivu in a survey conducted in December 2020.\n\nAnother station in Butembo, Radio Salama, \"is able to take its own initiatives by producing magazines and spots that are edited at the radio and broadcast to audiences,\" said Kavira Syntiche, a journalist at the station and Communications Officer of the Collective of Women Journalists in Butembo.\n\nAt the beginning of the year [2021], Radio Salama had developed listening clubs to engage with community members and place their concerns are at the center of the health emergency response.\n\n\"We have 10 listening clubs at the moment,\" said Syntiche. \"We go there to produce educational programs with the population, programs that focus on COVID-19 and sexual violence. We integrated the issue of the fight against Ebola from the moment the disease reappeared. We record the listening club sessions, and these are included in our radio programs for broadcast.\"\n\nListening clubs include citizens who regularly follow radio programs in their community and then share their views and those of the community on the issues covered in the program. This helps the radio station staff understand and respond to citizens' concerns.\n\nOne women member from a listening club in Butemo expressed concern that more needs to be done. \"Awareness is still low if we compare the 10th epidemic with the 12th,\" she said. \"Journalists have to know that they are like doctors. First save lives.\"\n\nIn a bid to streamline the local Ebola response, the Network of Community Radio Stations in North Kivu (CORACON), which Internews worked with in the last Ebola outbreak, engaged its members in radio content development and coordination.\n\nWhile acknowledging that DRC's local media is still economically fragile, CORACON's Director, Jack Vagheni, said that building the capacity of local media prior to the outbreak has enabled journalists to quickly develop quality programs to inform the population and helped them address rumors that can complicate the response efforts.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[This news is very welcome.

Almost 15% (14.8%) of statin users died in-hospital within 30 days of admission, compared with 26.5% of those who did not, resulting in a 0.47 odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.62). Overall, 17.2% of statin users died while hospitalized, compared with 31.0%.\n\nThe need for invasive mechanical ventilations, days on a ventilator, or length of hospital stay were not statistically significantly different between the groups. Those who took statins, however, had on average lower levels of C-reactive protein upon admission (100.0 milligrams per liter vs 120.7), which can indicate less inflammation.\n\nOut of all 2626 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the hospital system, 36.2% used statins prior to admission. Statin users were more likely to be older (median age 70 vs 62), have Medicare or Medicaid versus a commercial insurer (63.0% vs 53.6%), and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (ranging from 5.4-30.7 percentage points in difference).\n\n\"If their beneficial effect bears out in randomized clinical trials, statins could potentially prove to be a low-cost and effective therapeutic strategy for COVID-19,\" said co-lead author Mahesh Madhavan, MD, in a Columbia University Irving Medical Center press release.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n----\n[A] News release, Columbia University\nDate: Fri 26 Feb 2021\nSource: EurekAlert!, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) [edited]\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/cuim-sua022621.php\n\n\nStatin use associated with increased survival in severe COVID-19\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nPeople who took statins to lower cholesterol were approximately 50% less likely to die if hospitalized for COVID-19, a study by physicians at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and NewYork-Presbyterian has found. \"Our study is one of the larger studies confirming this hypothesis and the data lay the groundwork for future randomized clinical trials that are needed to confirm the benefit of statins in COVID-19,\" says Aakriti Gupta, MD, a cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and one of the co-lead authors of the study. \"If their beneficial effect bears out in randomized clinical trials, statins could potentially prove to be a low-cost and effective therapeutic strategy for COVID-19,\" adds co-lead author Mahesh V Madhavan, MD, also a cardiologist at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nWhy Look at statins?\n--------------------\nGupta, Madhavan, and the study's leadership group are cardiologists who cared for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the spring and summer of 2020 when the 1st wave of the pandemic swept through New York City. \"We observed that patients who got very sick and required hospitalization had high rates of hyperinflammation and clotting,\" says Elaine Wan, MD, the Esther Aboodi Assistant Professor of Medicine in Cardiology and Cardiac Electrophysiology and a cardiac electrophysiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, one of the study's senior authors. \"As cardiologists, statins naturally came to mind,\" Gupta says. \"In addition to their well-known cholesterol-lowering effect, statins are known for their anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and immunomodulatory properties.\"\n\nStudy analyzed data from electronic health records\n--------------------------------------------------\nBased on their observations, the authors looked at outcomes for 2626 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a quaternary academic medical center in Manhattan during the 1st 18 weeks of the pandemic. The researchers compared 648 patients who regularly used statins before developing COVID-19 to 648 patients who did not use statins. Patients in each group were matched so that there were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, or use of other medications at home.\n\n50% fewer deaths among statin users\n-----------------------------------\nAmong the statin users, 96 (14.8%) died in the hospital within 30 days of admission compared with 172 (26.5%) of patients who did not use statins. When other differences among the patients were factored in, the researchers found that statin use was significantly associated with a 50% reduction in in-hospital mortality (within 30 days). Patients on statins also tended to have lower levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. Statin use was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (18.6% in statin users vs. 21.9%), days on a ventilator (13.5 vs 12.8), or length of hospital stay (7 vs 7).\n\nComparison with other studies\n------------------------------\nOther studies and meta-analyses from China have also suggested a survival benefit from statins among COVID-19 patients. However, these results may not apply to patients in Western countries who generally have more cardiovascular disease. The current study is one of the larger studies confirming the association. Smaller retrospective studies out of North America and Europe have found similar results.\n\nRandomized clinical trials needed\n---------------------------------\nAlthough the study compared closely matched participants and adjusted for other variables, as a retrospective analysis, unknown factors could explain the results. \"Only randomized controlled clinical trials can evaluate the benefits of statins in COVID-19 patients,\" says senior author Sahil A Parikh, MD, associate professor of medicine and a cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Several randomized trials are underway, including studies to determine if statins can prevent hospitalization in outpatients, and lower the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n----\n[B] Original source reference\nDate: Fri 26 Feb 2021\nSource: Nature [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21553-1\n\n\nref: Gupta A, Madhavan MV, Poterucha TJ, et al.

PMID: 33637713; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21553-1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in a hyperinflammatory state, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial injury, and thrombotic complications, among other sequelae. Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from [1 Feb through 12 May 2020] with study period ending on [11 Jun 2020]. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint includes in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, statin use is significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36-0.62, p\u2009less than 0.001). We conclude that antecedent statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with lower inpatient mortality.\n\nDiscussion [abridged, edited]\n-----------------------------\nThe principal findings of this analysis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are (1) antecedent statin use was common in our cohort, as 36% of patients admitted to our institution were prescribed statins prior to their index admission; (2) patients receiving statins were older, with a higher burden of cardiovascular comorbidities, (3) patients receiving statins tended to present with lower levels of CRP [C-reactive protein is a protein found in blood plasma, whose circulating concentrations rise in response to inflammation. It is an acute-phase protein of hepatic origin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein) - Mod.LK] and (4) antecedent statin use was associated with significantly lower odds of patients experiencing the primary endpoint of in-hospital mortality in a propensity-matched analysis.\n\nThe current analysis suggests that statins merit further evaluation in COVID-19 given their pleiotropic properties and potentially disease-modifying effects in the setting of this viral illness.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See publication for possible explanations why statins improve outcome in patients. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Long haul flight transmission\nDate: Sun 28 Feb 2021\nSource: News Medical Life sciences [edited]\nhttps://www.news-medical.net/news/20210228/New-evidence-of-SARS-CoV-2-spreading-on-planes.aspx\n\n\nNew research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below] analyzed a case showing in-flight transmission of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite passengers getting tested before departing to New Zealand.\n\nSince the 1st coronavirus wave, New Zealand has had an exceptional response to the pandemic with a system of managed isolation and quarantine for people entering the country. The restrictions also expanded to include testing people for COVID-19 on the 3rd and 12th day of quarantine.\n\nThe world currently has over 114 million global cases and over 2.53 million deaths. New Zealand has some of the lowest cases around the globe reporting approximately 2378 cases and 26 deaths.\n\nThe study \"Genomic evidence of in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 despite predeparture testing\" may help scientists and public health officials further understand the exact risk of coronavirus transmission on long flights. The international research team, led by Tara Swadi from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, writes: \"Combined, these data present a likely scenario of more than 4 SARS-CoV-2 transmission events during a long-haul flight from Dubai to Auckland. These transmission events occurred despite the reported in-flight use of masks and gloves. Further transmission between travel companions then occurred after the flight, in a MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facility.\"\n\nDetails on COVID flight transmission between 7 passengers\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe team gathered case data from a coronavirus outbreak on a plane on [29 Sep 2020], arriving from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand. During the 14-day managed isolation and quarantine, 7 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The researchers collected data from the Ministry of Health collection for epidemic surveillance. All 7 passengers infected with SARS-CoV-2 came from 5 different countries, and 5 were tested negative on one layover stop in Malaysia. All 7 passengers were seated 4 rows away from each other during an 18-hour flight. During the flight and before leaving the Dubai airport, mask-wearing was optional. 5 of the 7 infected passengers wore masks and gloves while on the plane, while 2 did not.\n\nGenomic SARS-CoV-2 data\n-----------------------\nThe researchers performed whole-genome sequencing on the test samples of the 7 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. They found the sequences were genetically identical, and with the exception of one mutation from one passenger, all SARS-CoV-2 samples came from the B.1 lineage. The researchers then compared the 7 genomes to the international database (GISAID) also found 6 identical genomes, with 4 coming from Switzerland and 2 from the United Kingdom.\n\nTracking down the source\n------------------------\nBased on the results, the team predicts 2 passengers were the source of infection. These passengers had traveled together from Switzerland and had tested negative 3 days before leaving the country. One of these passengers was the 1st to report symptoms of COVID-19 infection on [1 Oct 2020] with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result the following day. In addition, they predict 4 passengers became infected during the flight, and 1 passenger became infected while in mandatory quarantine.\n\nLimitations in genomic surveillance pose difficulty in finding the source of transmission\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHowever, the researchers suggest limited global sequencing data makes it hard to narrow down the source of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the plane. \"These findings were consistent with virus introduction onto the airplane from Switzerland by passenger A, B, or both. Nevertheless, accurately identifying the source of this outbreak may be impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data; hence, we cannot explicitly exclude passenger C as the source.\"\n\nThere's also the possibility of an alternative exposure event, such as SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the Dubai airport before boarding. Although, they suggest the close seating makes in-flight transmission a likely option. \"Although not definitive, these findings underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2, even if pre-departure testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight.\"\n\n[Byline: Jocelyn Solis-Moreira]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from Google Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Reference\n----------\nSwadi T, Geoghegan JL, Devine T, et al.

PMID: 33400642; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/3/20-4714_article\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Abstract\n--------\n\"Since the 1st wave of coronavirus disease in March 2020, citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand have been required to undergo managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of [20 Oct 2020], of 62 698 arrivals, testing of persons in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 86 passengers on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that arrived in New Zealand on [29 Sep 2020], test results were positive for 7 persons in MIQ. These passengers originated from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; 5 had negative predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results. To assess possible points of infection, we analyzed information about their journeys, disease progression, and virus genomic data. All 7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, except for a single mutation in one sample. Despite predeparture testing, multiple instances of in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission are likely.\n\n\"Discussion [abridged, edited]\n------------------------------\n\"Evidence of in-flight transmission on a flight from the United Arab Emirates to New Zealand is strongly supported by the epidemiologic data, in-flight seating plan, symptom onset dates, and genomic data for this group of travelers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\"Among the 7 passengers, 2 were probably index case-patients infected before the flight, 4 were probably infected during the flight, and the remaining passenger was probably infected while in MIQ. All 7 passengers were seated in aisle seats within 2 rows of where the presumed index case-patient(s) were seated.\n\n\"Combined, these data present a likely scenario of 4 or more SARS-CoV-2 transmission events during a long-haul flight from Dubai to Auckland. These transmission events occurred despite reported in-flight use of masks and gloves. Further transmission between travel companions then occurred after the flight, in an MIQ facility.\n\n\"Similar reports of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted during flight have recently been published (3,4,16,17). Those reports, along with the findings we report, demonstrate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread on long-haul flights. It must also be noted that the auxiliary power unit of the flight EK448 aircraft was reported as having been inoperative for [approximately] 30 minutes during the 2-hour refueling stop in Kuala Lumpur, such that the environmental control system would not have been working during this period.\n\n\"That 3 passengers had positive test results on day 3 of their 14-day quarantine period indicates some of the complexities of determining the value of predeparture testing, including the modality and timing of any such testing. Although not definitive, these findings underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2, even if predeparture testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight.\"\n\nReferences\n--------\n3.

Since individuals were apparently infected within 4 rows of seating, it is impossible to separate passengers sufficiently to assure safety. Quarantine would protect the destination location, but not necessarily the passengers, depending on how they are housed and the interactions permitted while in quarantine. This is a dilemma for the airlines and travelers. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 1 Mar 2021)\nDate: Mon 1 Mar 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 1 Mar 2021 18:03 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n---------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 626 645 (6063) / 29 074 (68)\nEuropean Region (61): 38 788 470 (109 136) / 863 489 (1583)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 539 176 (22 167) / 208 321 (308)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 418 407 (30 158) / 144 845 (366)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 50 595 663 (169 603) / 1 209 960 (4715)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 851 062 (10 854) / 72 189 (198)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 113 820 168 (347 981) / 2 527 891 (7238)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 1 Mar 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20update%201%20Mar%202021_1614630370.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 48.7% of daily case numbers and 65.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 50.59 million cases.

A global total of 6433 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 28 Feb 2021 to late 1 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (6 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain (15 978), Italy (13 106), Russia (11 571), and India (11 378). A total of 40 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 40 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Mexico, Belgium, Sweden, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Costa Rica, and Lithuania, among others -- this combined with marked reductions in daily counts is indicative of the continued weekend reporting artifact.\n\nComparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 5d.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 4.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.7% increase in reported deaths.\n\nImpression: The global daily reported cases totaled just under 300 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 114.98 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.54 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again, unconfirmed but possibly due to the impact of the variants in circulation. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nCOVID-19 update (83): summary tidbits, intellectual property, holistic model, WHO 20210301.8219679\nCOVID-19 update (82): mapping escape mutants, variants, vaccines, WHO, global 20210228.8218147\nCOVID-19 update (81): transmission, reinfection, vaccine and case severity, WHO 20210227.8216798\nCOVID-19 update (80): vaccine, USA variants, comments, WHO, global 20210226.8214650\nCOVID-19 update (70): gangrene, challenge trials, immunity, cancer, WHO, global 20210218.8198620\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, pangolin, bat 20210211.8184900\nCOVID-19 update (50): UK vaccine study, Brazil reinfection, WHO 20210205.8167161\nCOVID-19 update (01): variants, vaccine, Thailand, global, WHO 20210101.8062938\n2020\n----\nUndiagnosed pediatric inflammatory syndrome (06): COVID-19, heart, young adults 20200522.7364506\nCOVID-19 update (562): viral load, UK vacc dose, ECDC, WHO 20201231.8061525\nCOVID-19 update (01): China, global, EVZD, reporting criteria, WHO 20200213.6984084\nNovel coronavirus (42): China, global, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, WHO 20200211.6979942\nNovel coronavirus (01): China (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU) (10): genome available, Hong Kong surveill. 20200111.6883998\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (01): (HU) wildlife sales, market closed, RFI 20200102.6866757\n2019\n----\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/lk/mpp/mj/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8222012", "headline": "Leptospirosis - Australia: (NT) cattle workers, alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8222012", "date": "2021-03-02 08:02:19", "main_text": "LEPTOSPIROSIS - AUSTRALIA: (NORTHERN TERRITORY) CATTLE WORKERS, ALERT\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 1 Mar 2021 3:00 pm AEST\nSource: Queensland Country Life [edited]\nhttps://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/story/7146558/wet-season-spike-in-a-rare-disease-among-cattle-workers/?cs=4698\n\n\nThe best wet season in a decade has also seen a spike in cases of the rare disease leptospirosis among cattle workers in the Top End.\n\nThere have already been 9 cases confirmed in the Northern Territory [NT], which has prompted the issuing of a health warning.\n\nLeptospirosis can be a fatal disease, which passes to humans chiefly through animal urine and cases have risen after the return of a better La Nina-inspired wet season across the Territory. It can be successfully treated with antibiotics; there is no vaccine [for humans].\n\nMelioidosis, or gardeners disease, is another risk to northern Australian residents who come into contact with soil disease from sodden ground.\n\nNT's Centre for Disease Control public health registrar Dr Damien Brown said there had already been 9 cases of leptospirosis confirmed among cattle workers since January [2021]. Most of the new cases have been linked to workers in the Daly River and rural Darwin region, with 2 cases confirmed in Pine Creek. There were only 4 cases confirmed in the Top End last year [2020] during a generally poor wet season.\n\n\"Leptospirosis is known to affect cattle and farm workers, and is particularly common after heavy rains,\" Dr Brown said. \"Anyone with a fever, muscle aches, and headache -- especially in the absence of cold-like symptoms like a runny nose -- is urged to see a doctor for further assessment and testing. The disease is easily treated with oral antibiotics if caught early, but left untreated can progress to a severe and sometimes fatal illness.\" Dr Brown said the disease poses most risk to people working on stations closely with animals or in abattoirs.\n\nHowever, contaminated water, mud, and soil can also be a risk. People camping, hunting, and gardening should take precautions, Dr Brown said.\n\nLeptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria _Leptospira_. It occurs in both humans and animals, mainly in tropical areas like the NT and north Queensland. \"The illness is caused by a bacterium that is found in animals such as pigs, cattle, rats, dogs, and possums, and spread by their infected urine,\" Dr Brown said. \"Humans become infected when we come into contact with contaminated water, wet soil, or animals or their tissue -- hence the other names 'cane cutter's fever' and 'mud fever'. The bacteria usually enter through cuts or grazes, or splashes to the eye or contact with the inside of the mouth.\"\n\nSymptoms -- sudden fever with headaches, chills, severe muscle pain (particularly in the legs), and reddened eyes -- typically occur after about 10 days and last around 3 weeks. \"Cough, diarrhoea, and vomiting can also occur and some people go on to develop more severe disease including jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), bleeding, breathing difficulties, and confusion, and in rare cases, this can be fatal,\" Dr Brown said.\n\n[Byline: Chris McLennan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news article above reports an increase in cases of leptospirosis occurring in cattle workers in Daly River and Pine Creek (small towns in the Katherine region) and in the Darwin region of the Top End, the northern-most portion of Australia's Northern Territory (NT). NT is located between the states of Western Australia to the west and Queensland to the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory). Its capital is Darwin. A map of NT showing the location of the 5 NT regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkly_Tableland#/media/File:Alice_Springs_region.jpg. Maps of Australia can be seen at http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif and < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/19647>.\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and frequently follows flooding after heavy rains. Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria, in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by urine of usually asymptomatic, but chronically infected animals, with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira_ spp. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions and are associated with one or more maintenance hosts. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are maintenance hosts that serve as reservoirs for this organism. _Leptospira_ spp. serovar Hardjo causes disease in cattle and humans throughout the world (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC130359). Serovar Hardjo is split into 2 species: _L. borgpetersenii_ serovar Hardjo, which is found worldwide, and the less frequent _L. interrogans_ serovar Hardjo (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159387).\n\nLeptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also, leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.\n\nMost patients with leptospirosis have a non-specific mild, flu-like illness. Some patients develop severe disease with myocardial, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic involvement. Multi-organ failure, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding may develop. Severe infection may be fatal in 5-40 per cent of cases.\n\nBecause of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made with confidence without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.\n\nLeptospirosis is usually treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone intravenously for severe disease and doxycycline or amoxicillin for milder disease. Antibiotic treatment is most efficacious when started early in the course of the disease (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12870063/). Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments\n(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805).\n- Mod.ML\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, affecting many animal species. In farm animals (cattle and pigs) it may cause considerable economic losses. _Leptospira borgpetersenii_ serovar Hardjo and _L. interrogans_ serovar Pomona have been shown to be the most important pathogenic serovars in cattle, responsible for systemic illness, abortion, neonatal death, weak calves, and various production losses throughout the world. In Australia, a range of serovars have been identified, including _L._ Hardjo, Tarassovi, Pomona, and Szwajizak. The disease is controlled mainly by vaccination.\n\nLeptospirosis is not included in OIE's list of reportable diseases. - Mod.AS]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nLeptospirosis - Australia: (NS) human, dog 20190710.6560060\n2018\n----\nLeptospirosis - Israel (06): (HZ) recreation, streams, bovine vaccination 20180827.5989589\nLeptospirosis - Israel (05): (HZ) recreation, streams, MOH update 20180819.5974231\nLeptospirosis, melioidosis - Australia: (QL) flooding, alert 20180310.5678104\n2017\n----\nLeptospirosis - Israel: bovine, Leptospira serovar Pomona, RFI 20170202.4811833\n2016\n----\nLeptospirosis - India (02): (MH) bovine 20160727.4374009\n2011\n----\nLeptospirosis - Australia (02): (NS) 20110422.1262\nLeptospirosis - Australia: (QL) alert 20110121.0246\n2010\n----\nLeptospirosis, farm workers, travelers - Australia (02): background 20100220.0581\nLeptospirosis, farm workers, travelers - Australia: (QL) aler t 20100219.0571\n.................................................sb/ml/mj/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8221811", "headline": "Bluetongue, cattle - Spain: susp. international trade issue, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8221811", "date": "2021-03-01 20:30:53", "main_text": "BLUETONGUE, CATTLE - SPAIN: SUSPECTED, INTERNATIONAL TRADE ISSUE, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*****************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 1 Mar 2021\nSource: The Guardian [edited]\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/01/cattle-stranded-on-ship-to-be-destroyed-in-port-as-second-vessel-returns-to-spain\n\n\nSpanish authorities are about to begin slaughtering hundreds of calves that have spent months crisscrossing the Mediterranean, said a lawyer for the cattle shippers.\n\nThe 864 cattle due for slaughter are onboard the Karim Allah, which is docked in the Spanish port of Cartagena. It is one of 2 vessels that left Spain in mid-December 2020 to deliver live cargoes of young bulls. The 2nd vessel, Elbeik, loaded almost 1800 cattle from Tarragona.\n\nThe Elbeik, now carrying more than 1700 cattle, also appears to be returning to Spain.\n\nBoth shipments ran into problems when they were refused entry by various countries, including Turkey and Libya, owing to fears the animals had a disease called bluetongue, which causes lameness and hemorrhaging among cattle but does not affect humans.\n\nDisease regulations outlined by Spanish officials mean the cattle cannot re-enter the EU having attempted to enter Libya. The slaughter order issued to Karim Allah's management, seen by the Guardian, states that Libya: \"Has a ban on the export of animals to the EU due to the existence of, among other epizootic diseases of major impact for livestock, foot-and-mouth disease in that state\" [see comment].\n\n\"The Spanish authorities have indicated they will start killing the cattle on Tue [2 Mar 2021],\" said Miquel Masramon, a lawyer representing Talia Shipping Line. The Karim Allah is owned by Khalifeh Livestock Trading and managed by Talia Shipping Line, both based in Lebanon, while the cattle are owned by a 3rd party.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday [27 Feb 2021], the agriculture ministry indicated that if the Karim Allah did not begin to \"isolate and slaughter the animals in accordance with the applicable regulations\" the ministry would do so.\n\nA source at the ministry said on Sun [28 Feb 2021] the shipper had been informed that it had until Mon 1 Mar 2021 midday to begin the slaughter. The ministry said: \"It is up to the shipowner in the 1st instance to isolate and slaughter the animals. He has until 1st thing tomorrow morning [Mon 1 Mar 2021] to communicate his decision to the administration.\"\n\nBoth the director of Talia Shipping Line, Majed Eid, and Masramon said they would fight the decision. Their aim, they say, is to allow the cattle time to heal and then find a new buyer, once they have the results of bluetongue blood tests taken last week.\n\nA report by Spanish veterinary officials who boarded the Karim Allah last week said the captain told them of 22 deaths at sea. Another 9 cattle were not accounted for. The report said 20 of the animals that died were chopped up and thrown overboard during the journey, citing information provided by the captain.\n\nThe report concluded that the animals had suffered from the lengthy journey and were generally in a poor state. Some were unwell and not fit for transport outside the EU, or fit to be allowed into Europe. Euthanasia would be best for their health and welfare, it concluded.\n\nThe report did not say whether the cattle had bluetongue but noted other skin, eye and leg conditions including alopecia, flaking, scabs, and joint inflammation compatible with septic arthritis.\n\nOn Sunday [28 Feb 2021], Masramon said he was trying to get a new veterinary report and was hoping to get a vet to board the ship and \"inspect the animals and respond to the Spanish authorities' veterinary report. The problem right now is to get the [vet] official approval to enter the port.\"\n\n[Byline: Sophie Kevany & Ashifa Kassam]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Following the refusal to unload its cargo in Turkey, the Karim Allah visited Tripoli (Libya) in an attempt to sell the Spanish cattle there, but was similarly refused. Spain's refusal to allow the unloading of the returning cattle is attributed by the authorities to the passage of the vessel in Tripoli, since Libya is regarded FMD-infected. Vaccination against FMD has been prohibited in the EU since 1991, accompanied by a severe import policy to protect the fully FMD-susceptible European cattle. Import is banned from FMD-infected, suspected, or vaccinating countries/regions. Libya was also suspected, in early 2020, of Rift Valley fever infections in small ruminants (by serology).\n\nFor the track of the Karim Allah livestock carrier since 17 Dec 2020, as published by Reuters on 25 Feb 2021, please see\nhttps://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xegpbwewqvq/KarimAllahCarrier.png.\n\nAccording to other reports (The Guardian, Reuters), a 2nd vessel with a consignment of cattle from Spain is returning to Spain; this refers to the Elbeik, which set sail a day after Karim Allah from Tarragona with a cargo of nearly 1800 cattle similarly destined to Turkey. Both vessels were refused unloading in Turkey. On Sat 27 Feb 2021, tracking the website Marine Traffic showed the Elbeik on its way back to Spain, destined for Cartagena. The vessel's return to Spain was confirmed in an email from the Cypriot government's chief veterinary officer, Christodoulos Charalambous Pipis, who has been monitoring the Elbeik. It spent several days anchored off the coast of northern Cyprus, outside the port of Famagusta.\n\nLate last week, a source told the Guardian that of the 1770 or so animals loaded on the Albeik, about 35 might have died, and the rest were in good condition. \"They are limousin and charolais cross [bulls], between 6 and 12 months old,\" the source said.\n\nRepresentatives from the Karim Allah and Elbeik argued that they were \"100% sure\" the cattle on the ship were bluetongue-free and that \"there was a mistake on the Spanish animal health paperwork. That is how this all started. They wrote Aragon [as the cattle's origin].

They are also being dramatically impacted by wildfires and habitat loss.\n\nWhile it is known that chlamydia is widespread among koalas, the cause of their cancers has long been a mystery. Researchers from Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin studied the DNA of 10 koalas and found a retrovirus embedded in their genome. HIV, which causes AIDS, is the most commonly known human retrovirus.\n\nThe genome-altering virus has infected the cells of koalas which create eggs and sperm, allowing the virus to be passed down the generations.\n\nKoala retrovirus (KoRV) often inserts itself at 'hot spots' which are near genes linked with cancer, and the researchers think the mutations brought about by the virus increases the prevalence of certain cancers.\n\nRemains of ancient retrovirus infections are commonly seen in the genomes of many vertebrates. These retrovirus relics indicate the infection occurred millions of years ago and has since been neutralised.\n\nBut analysis of 10 cancer-riddled koalas from the wild reveals the marsupial population only 1st became infected with KoRV around 50 000 years ago. Since then it has spread and it is now found in every koala in Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nThe DNA samples revealed each koala has around 80 - 100 inherited copies of KoRV in its genome. 'The genomic locations of most of these are not shared between koalas, indicating a rapid expansion and accumulation of KoRV copies in the population,' says Professor Alex Greenwood, head of wildlife diseases at the Leibniz-IZW.\n\n'Each time a retrovirus copies and re-inserts itself into the genome, it causes a mutation, potentially disrupting gene expression, which could be detrimental to the host.'\n\nAs the virus spreads throughout a koala it slowly rewrites more of the koala's genome and replaces its original DNA. The German team found a copy of KoRV had incorporated an entire cancer-related gene into one koala's DNA sequence.\n\nThe analysis also suggests KoRV predisposes koalas to particular tumours and these genes can then also be inherited by their offspring.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Before the discovery of the koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV), mammalian endogenous retrovirus were thought not to produce infectious particles. KoRV retains its ability to form virus particles capable of 'de novo' horizontal infection transmission. Due to this, it is thought to be undergoing a process of 'endogenization'.\n\nRecent investigations in koalas kept in zoos revealed the existence of 4 subtypes of KoRV, KoRV-A, KoRV-B, and KoRV-J. Different subtypes have different traits in their transmission and pathogenicity.\n\nA recent study (https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9529) described the 1st exogenous retrovirus in bats, the Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus (HPG) in northeast Australia. Koala populations are currently in severe decline and at risk from KoRV, which is closely related to HPG. HPG is also related to the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), which suggests that the origins of KoRV and GALV are spill-over from bats.\n\nKoalas are at an early state of the endogenization process of KoRV, and so the extinction of the exogenous retroviral counterpart and genomic fixation may not be reached for hundreds of years. Until that happens, koalas must endure and overcome the impact on their health, including increased cancer rates.\n\nResearch article referenced:\nMcEwen GK, Alquezar-Planas DE, Dayaram A, et al.

Under the new restrictions, almost all travel will be banned. There are only a few exemptions, including lorry drivers and certain key workers. Anyone crossing the border will have to provide a valid negative COVID-19 test. Earlier this month [February 2021], Germany added the Czech Republic and Tyrol in Austria to its list of hotspots where the UK and South African variants -- thought to be more contagious -- are spreading. Entry bans targeting those areas caused long tailbacks on motorways leading to the German border. The travel restrictions for Moselle are due to take effect from Tuesday [2 Mar 2021].\n\n- The majority of people in Germany are still in support of the current lockdown measures, but the share has been slowly dropping, a poll published on Sunday [28 Feb 2021] by the Welt am Sonntag. The share of the population which considered the coronavirus measures appropriate was at 63% in February [2021], down from 69% in November [2020] and 73% in September [2020]. Germany's Robert Koch Institute reported 7890 new cases in the past 24 hours on Sunday [28 Feb 2021]. There were also 157 coronavirus deaths reported -- this brought the total number of deaths in the country since the beginning of the pandemic to over 70 000.\n\n- Britain's government says families with children in school will be provided with free twice-weekly coronavirus home test kits, regardless of whether anyone has symptoms. The tests will be offered as part of plans for schools to reopen, beginning on [Mon 8 Mar 2021].\n\n- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been vaccinated against coronavirus, he announced on his official Facebook page on Sunday [28 Feb 2021]. He received the shot developed by China's Sinopharm pharmaceutical company.\n\n- Danish police have arrested 8 people at an anti-lockdown demonstration in Copenhagen. The largely peaceful rally late Saturday [27 Feb 2021] was attended by around 1200 people. It was the 1st such protest since the government announced last week that it was extending many anti-coronavirus restrictions. The police said they arrested people for allegedly using fireworks and for rowdy behavior.\n\nAmericas\n--------\n- The US Food and Drug Administration approved the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for emergency use on Saturday evening [27 Feb 2021], making it the 3rd vaccine to be given the green light in the country.\n\n- Thousands of Argentinians gathered in front of government buildings in Buenos Aires on Saturday [27 Feb 2021] evening to protest \"vaccine privileges.\" The revelation that people close to the minister of health had been able to jump the queue sparked outrage and ended with the minister losing his position.\n\nAfrica\n------\n- Nigeria expects to become the 3rd West African country to receive vaccines from the COVAX program. It is expecting 3.92 million doses in the shipment. The country is expecting 16 million overall doses in the next few months from COVAX. The country plans to vaccinate 40% of its some 200 million people by the end of the year [2021], and 30% more in 2022.\n\n- South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said there is an agreement to secure 11 million Johnson & Johnson vaccines through the end of the year. About 1/4 of those vaccines would come in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Ramaphosa added that the cabinet decided to ease restrictions on movement due to a drop in cases, downgrading the national alert level from 3 to 1.\n\nAsia and Oceania\n----------------\n- Iran's coronavirus fatalities broke the 60 000 mark on Sunday [28 Feb 2021] after a further 93 people died in 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The Islamic Republic is battling the Middle East's worst outbreak of the illness.\n\n- Residents in New Zealand's biggest city Auckland woke up on Sunday [28 Feb 2021] to a 2nd lockdown this month [February 2021]. The 7-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after a community coronavirus case was found with no links to a previous cluster. The person had also been infectious for a week but was not in isolation, fueling concerns that there could be additional cases [apparently the case was connected to the case earlier in February 2021, according to the other cases' family https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/124390078/covid19-case-n-went-for-a-walk-with-mother-in-cluster-household-during-alert-level-3.]\n\n- Thailand launched its vaccination program on Sunday [28 Feb 2021], administering doses of the Chinese SinoVac vaccine to frontline health and medical workers as well as cabinet ministers. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, 66, fell outside of the age range of the SinoVac vaccine -- 18-59 -- and so did not receive a dose.\n\n- The Philippines has received its 1st batch of COVID-19 vaccines. The 600 000 doses were donated by China. The country is among the last in Southeast Asia to secure the critical doses despite having the 2nd-highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the hard-hit region.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Other developments in Africa: Ghana became the \"1st country to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the World Health Organization's COVAX program on Wednesday [24 Feb 2021], a joint statement issued by UNICEF Ghana and WHO Ghana said.\n\nThe vaccines were produced by the Serum Institute of India, in the Indian city of Pune, and are part of the 1st wave of COVID-19 vaccines headed to low and middle-income countries, the joint statement added. \"Today marks the historic moment for which we have been planning and working so hard,\" said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. \"With the 1st shipment of doses, we can make good on the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the race for life-saving vaccines.\"\n(Excerpted from https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/24/africa/ghana-covax-vaccine-intl/index.html)]\n\n\"Ivory Coast received a shipment of COVID-19 doses from the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility on Friday [26 Feb 2021], becoming the 2nd country to benefit from a programme meant to ensure fairer distribution amid a global scramble.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says 'we can't beat COVID without vaccine equity'26 Feb 2021 Countries seeking their own COVID-19 vaccine doses are making deals with drug companies that threaten the supply for the global COVAX programme for poor and middle-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri [26 Feb 2021].\n\n\"Now, some countries are still pursuing deals that will compromise the COVAX supply. Without a doubt,\" WHO senior adviser Bruce Aylward told a briefing.\n\nThe WHO has long called upon rich countries to ensure that vaccines are shared equitably. The global organisation is one of the leaders of COVAX, a programme that aims to supply 1.3 billion vaccine doses to poor and middle-income countries this year. But so far, COVAX has had a slow roll-out. \"We can't beat COVID without vaccine equity. Our world will not recover fast enough without vaccine equity, this is clear,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\"We have made great progress. But that progress is fragile. We need to accelerate the supply and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and we cannot do that if some countries continue to approach manufacturers who are producing vaccines that COVAX is counting on.\"\n\n\"These actions undermine COVAX and deprive health workers and vulnerable people around the world of life-saving vaccines.\"\n\nThe Ivory Coast received its 1st batch of coronavirus vaccines under the COVAX scheme on Friday [26 Feb 2021]\n\nIntellectual property plea Tedros also called for countries to waive intellectual property rules, to allow other countries to make vaccines more quickly. \"If not now, when?\" he asked.\n\nThe idea of temporarily waiving intellectual property rights for tools to fight COVID-19 is set to come up again next week at a meeting of World Trade Organization (WTO) member states. In the past, it has run into opposition from rich countries with big pharmaceutical industries.\n\nIncoming WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria has said her top priority would be to ensure the trade body does more to address the COVID-19 pandemic, calling disparities in vaccine rates between rich and poor \"unconscionable\".\n\nThe 164-member WTO body usually has to agree by consensus unless members agree to proceed to a rare vote.\n\nSeparately, the WHO said Nigeria is expecting its 1st 4 million doses of coronavirus vaccines next week via COVAX. Walter Kazadi Mulombo, head of WHO's mission in Nigeria, told a briefing by video link that Nigeria was expecting 14 million doses in total.\n\nChikwe Ihekweazu, Director General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said the situation in Nigeria was so far much better than had been widely predicted early in the pandemic.\n\nNigeria, Africa's most populous country with some 200 million people, has reported fewer than 1900 COVID-19 deaths so far.\n\n\"The whole world expected the continent of Africa, and Nigeria with our social and economic realities, to basically fall apart,\" Ihekweazu told the briefing.\n\nHe also referred to the findings of seroprevalence studies, published on Monday [22 Feb 2021], which suggested that 23 percent of Lagos state inhabitants -- around 4 million people -- may have had COVID-19 in October [2020].\n\nHe said studies in 4 Nigerian states had shown that serious illness appeared to be rarer than feared, possibly in part because of the young average age of the population.\n\n\"Getting the vaccine into Nigeria will serve the continent well, will serve the world well,\" he said.\n\nNigeria plans to inoculate 40 percent of the population this year [2021] and 30 percent more in 2022.\n\nIhekweazu said authorities recognised the need for equity in access to vaccines and was committed to pursuing multilateral deals.\n\n\"We will not look for bilateral deals,\" Ihekweazu said.\n\n\"We will work in a multilateral way with WHO, with COVAX with the African Union (AU) to make sure that as we get vaccines into Nigeria, the same happens ... across the continent,\" he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is important to control COVID-19 and fair to the people that low- and middle-income countries have equal access to the vaccine.

Some of this is attributable to the relative importance of those features, but most is attributable to computational necessity -- simulating even a single protein in such excruciating resolution is extraordinarily computation-intensive. Now, researchers from the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego have developed the 1st complete model of the coronavirus, finding, among other things, that its spike proteins move cooperatively.\n\n\"We wanted to understand how SARS-CoV-2 works holistically as a whole particle,\" said Gregory Voth, a professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and corresponding author of the study, in an interview with Jorge Salazar of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). \"We developed a bottom-up coarse-grained model where we took information from atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations and from experiments.\"\n\nVoth and his colleagues have been using the coarse-grained modeling method, which resolves groups of atoms rather than each individual atom, to study viruses like HIV and the flu for decades. \"The benefit of the coarse-grained model is that it can be hundreds to thousands of times more computationally efficient than the all-atom model,\" he said. \"What you're left with are the much slower, collective motions. The effects of the higher frequency, all-atom motions are folded into those interactions if you do it well. That's the idea of systematic coarse-graining.\"\n\nUsing the coarse-graining method, the team simplified and combined atomistic models of SARS-CoV-2's spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins. Some of these all-atom models were generated by the Amaro Lab (led by Gordon Bell Special Prize winner Rommie Amaro) using the 23.5 Linpack petaflops Frontera supercomputer at TACC, and the remaining models were generated on the Anton 2 system at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).\n\n\"Frontera and Anton 2 provided the key molecular level input data into this model,\" Voth said. \"Frontera has been especially useful in providing the molecular dynamics data at the atomistic level for feeding into this model. It's very valuable.\"\n\nThe supercomputer-powered coarse-grained model showed some interesting behavior: the virus' spike proteins, which litter its surface and allow it to infect human cells, move cooperatively.\n\n\"They don't move independently like a bunch of random, uncorrelated motions. They work together,\" Voth said. \"The paper we published shows the beginnings of how the modes of motion in the spike proteins are correlated.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the model would be, as a 1st step, to study the initial virion attractions and interactions with ACE2 receptors on cells and to understand the origins of that attraction and how those proteins work together to go on to the virus fusion process.\"\n\n[Byline: Oliver Peckham]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Reference\n----------\nYu A, Pak AJ, He P, et al.

Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and ongoing development of a largely \"bottom-up\" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data become publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.\n\n\"Significance\n-------------\n\"This study reports the construction of a molecular model for the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details our multiscale approach toward model refinement. The resulting model and methods can be applied to and enable the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 virions.\n\n\"A holistic model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion can provide insight into the mechanisms of large-scale viral processes and the collective behavior of macromolecules involved in viral replication and infectivity.\"\n- Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 28 Feb 2021)\nDate: Sun 28 Feb 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 28 Feb 2021 18:31 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n---------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 620 580 (6983) / 29 006 (114)\nEuropean Region (61): 38 674 452 (139 264) / 861 803 (2296)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 517 009 (24 114) / 208 013 (317)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 388 249 (27 904) / 144 479 (339)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 50 426 060 (179 480) / 1 205 245 (4920)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 840 208 (7211) / 71 991 (244)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 113 467 303 (384 956) / 2 520 550 (8230)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 28 Feb 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20COVID%20update%2028%20Feb%202021_1614557361.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 46.6% of daily case numbers and 59.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 50.42 million cases.

A global total of 6599 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 27 Feb 2021 to late 28 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Italy (17 440), India (15 801), Russia (11 359), Poland (10 101), and Mexico (10 056). A total of 47 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 47 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Lithuania among others -- this combined with marked reductions in daily counts is indicative of the weekend reporting artifact.\n\nComparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 2.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 4.9% increase in reported deaths.\n\nImpression: The global daily reported cases totaled almost 380 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 114.36 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.53 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again, unconfirmed but possibly due to the impact of the variants in circulation. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nCOVID-19 update (82): mapping escape mutants, variants, vaccines, WHO, global 20210228.8218147\nCOVID-19 update (81): transmission, reinfection, vaccine and case severity, WHO 20210227.8216798\nCOVID-19 update (80): vaccine, USA variants, comments, WHO, global 20210226.8214650\nCOVID-19 update (79): fitness facilities, variants, vs influenza, WHO, global 20210225.8213103\nCOVID-19 update (78): animal, Spain, pet ferret 20210224.8211251\nCOVID-19 update (77): vaccine effects, variants, UK vaccination impact, WHO 20210224.8210082\nCOVID-19 update (76): mutation & recomb, transmission, school, Tanzania, WHO 20210223.8207677\nCOVID-19 update (75): rapid testing, Israel vaccine results, WHO, global 20210222.8205363\nCOVID-19 update (74): vaccines, variants, genomic surveillance WHO, global 20210221.8204585\nCOVID-19 update (73): post COVID, encephalopathy, USA safety monitoring, WHO 20210220.8202495\nCOVID-19 update (72): Africa reporting, UK lockdown impact, Israel vaccine, WHO 20210219.8200334\nCOVID-19 update (71): world, animal, mink, WHO/FAO/OIE risk assessment 20210218.8200008\nCOVID-19 update (70): gangrene, challenge trials, immunity, cancer, WHO, global 20210218.8198620\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, pangolin, bat 20210211.8184900\nCOVID-19 update (50): UK vaccine study, Brazil reinfection, WHO 20210205.8167161\nCOVID-19 update (01): variants, vaccine, Thailand, global, WHO 20210101.8062938\n2020\n----\nUndiagnosed pediatric inflammatory syndrome (06): COVID-19, heart, young adults 20200522.7364506\nCOVID-19 update (562): viral load, UK vacc dose, ECDC, WHO 20201231.8061525\nCOVID-19 update (01): China, global, EVZD, reporting criteria, WHO 20200213.6984084\nNovel coronavirus (42): China, global, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, WHO 20200211.6979942\nNovel coronavirus (01): China (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU) (10): genome available, Hong Kong surveill. 20200111.6883998\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (01): (HU) wildlife sales, market closed, RFI 20200102.6866757\n2019\n----\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/mpp/lk/mpp/mj/lxl", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8219231", "headline": "Ebola update (20): USA, Guinea, Sub-Saharan Africa", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8219231", "date": "2021-02-28 18:42:54", "main_text": "EBOLA UPDATE (20): UNITED STATES, GUINEA, SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] USA\n[2] Guinea: caregivers\n[3] Sub-Saharan Africa: Spillover events\n\n******\n[1] USA\n- Fri 26 Feb 2021. Monitoring travelers\nCBS News (abridged, edited)\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-monitoring-program-u-s-considering-as-new-cases-reported-in-africa/\n\n\nThe U.S. will soon be monitoring travelers coming into the country from 2 nations impacted by the Ebola virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Fri 26 Feb 2021. The CDC confirmed these plans after CBS News 1st reported the details on Friday [26 Feb 2021] night.\n\nStarting next week, the \"very small number\" of travelers arriving from Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be funneled to 6 U.S. airports where their information will be collected and shared with local health officials, the CDC said.\n\nAs of 25 Feb 2021, 9 Ebola cases have been reported in Guinea, resulting in 5 deaths, and 8 cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in 4 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC stressed in its statement that \"the outbreaks are centered in remote areas of these countries,\" and said \"the risk of Ebola to the United States is extremely low.\"\n\nThe CDC said airlines \"will collect and transmit passenger information to CDC for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days. This information will be shared with U.S. state and local health departments to appropriately monitor arrivals in their jurisdiction.\"\n\nA source familiar with the decision said John F. Kennedy in New York, Dulles outside Washington, D.C., O'Hare in Chicago, Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, Los Angeles International Airport and Newark Liberty outside New York were all being considered as monitoring points. The CDC did not specify which airports it plans to use.\n\nThis funneling approach is similar to steps taken in 2014 when travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were directed to 5 of those airports, where they had their temperature taken upon arrival.\n\nBetween March 2014 and April 2016, there were more than 28 000 cases of Ebola in West Africa, and 11 310 people died, according to the CDC.\n\nWith the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is recognition within the CDC that resources for additional monitoring are stretched thin, according to one of the people familiar with the discussions. Almost 30 000 people were monitored by the CDC for Ebola beginning in 2014, an effort that required hundreds of CDC staff, the CDC said.\n\n\"This is a great example of how we have to be prepared for anything in the public health arena,\" another source familiar with the discussions said about the monitoring before the news was announced.\n\nIn 2014, the Obama administration appointed Ron Klain to lead the U.S. Ebola strategy. Klain is now President Biden's chief of staff.\n\n[Byline: Bo Erickson, Corey Rangel and Ed O'Keefe]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[Diverting and monitoring for Ebola in US travelers from the DRC and Guinea when there are only a handful of cases seems overly cautious and an added burden on public health personnel at a time when there is tremendous pressure from COVID. Resources are already stretched thin. The situation is very different from that occurring during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. Certainly, medical personnel should be alerted to the ongoing outbreak in the DRC and Guinea so they can be certain their hospitals and staff are prepared to respond immediately should a potential patient be identified. - Mod.LK]\n\n----\n- Fri 26 Feb 2021.

Airlines will collect passenger information for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n******\n[2] Guinea: Caregivers\n- 26 Feb 2021\nDaily Mail (abridged, edited)\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-9305209/In-Ebola-stricken-Guinea-caregivers-no-risks.html\n\n\nEbola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.\n\nHigh mortality rates, and harrowing memories of the previous outbreak, has made some in Nzerekore reticent about seeking treatment. However the prognosis appears better this time around.\n\nAt least 5 people have died in the latest outbreak, according to the country's health agency, although there is some confusion over the exact death toll.\n\nGuinean health authorities have also reported 10 confirmed or probable Ebola cases and are tracking 400 more contact cases.\n\nThe country also launched a vaccination campaign against Ebola this week, a treatment which was unavailable during the last epidemic.\n\nGuinea's government, medical NGOs, and the World Health Organization mobilised quickly after news of the outbreak. Vaccinations began only a week after the outbreak was confirmed, and medical teams were rapidly deployed to Nzerekore. The treatment centre there consists of a small compound of several buildings painted yellow and red, surrounded by a metal grating.\n\n\"People need to understand that an Ebola treatment centre is not a hospice,\" said Dally Muamba, a doctor employed at the centre by the Alliance for International Medical Action.\n\nHe added that the centre is using a treatment developed in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- where Ebola is endemic -- which involves injecting patients with antibodies extracted from survivors of the disease.\n\n\"Chances of survival are much higher today,\" Muamba says.\n\nAlseny-Modet Camara, the head of the treatment centre, agrees. \"The mortality rate was up to 70 percent before we were able to reduce that mortality to less than 10 percent,\" he said.\n\nA middle-aged man emerges from one of the small buildings with his eyes downcast, drips in both arms, and sits on a plastic chair. The man has just learned he has Ebola. An Ebola survivor from the 1st epidemic, nicknamed \"Dr Papus,\" broke the news to him, and tried to reassure him. \"I tell them that I have faced this disease, that we must not give up,\" says Papus, whose father and uncle both died of Ebola in 2014.\n\nHe says he did not believe in the epidemic until he fell ill, and subsequently recovered. \"Since I am already immune, I have to help others, I have to go back and face this demon again,\" he says.\n\nBut not everyone survives. On Thu 25 Feb 2021 evening, a Red Cross pick-up truck arrived at the centre, its paintwork faded from repeat disinfections. It had come to remove the body of a patient who had succumbed to Ebola and whose burial will also be subject to strict medical precautions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[See map: https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/02/26/19/wire-39813532-1614367679-314_634x599.jpg, where Guinea's latest Ebola outbreak occurred.\n\nThe response this time was very fast. But the problem now seems to fall on diagnosis: early and rapid diagnosis is needed to prevent a patient from going to multiple healthcare centers for medical help. If rapid tests were in stock in clinics in countries where Ebola is enzootic/endemic and doctors were trained to use them if Ebola is even remotely suspected when the patient presents with fever and bleeding, that would be a good practice. It could prevent spread beyond the initial site. - Mod LK]\n\n******\n[3] Sub-Saharan Africa: Spillover events\n- 24 Feb 2021\nForbes (abridged, edited)\nhttps://apple.news/AqaOTkhBpSdyxuM1VZS_OqA\n\n\nI reported recently on the 2 new outbreaks of Ebola in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the time, there were 4 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and 8 cases in Guinea. Since then, another 2 or 3 cases have been found in the DRC.\n\nThis is the 12th Ebola epidemic in the DRC, and the 2nd in Guinea.\n\nEbola is a zoonotic pathogen, meaning that the virus is maintained in a wild animal species, or reservoir. Under conditions that aren't particularly well understood, it periodically spills over from animal populations into people. Ebola 1st came to global attention in 2015 during the West Africa epidemic that spread widely throughout Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and less extensively in Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the UK, and the USA.\n\nA map published in the scientific journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2015 [see comment below] shows where Ebola virus outbreaks have historically occurred along with the animal species implicated in the spillover process. The timeline on the right shows when these outbreaks occurred, including an outbreak of an unidentified pathogen in DRC in 1972 that is now suspected to have been Ebola.\n\nIt has been 5 years since that map was published. Since then, there have been 5 more outbreaks, bringing the total to 27, including (1) a 2018 outbreak in Equateur province (DRC); (2) an epidemic that lasted from August 2018 to June 2020 in the Eastern region of Kivu (DRC), which also spread to Uganda; (3) an outbreak last year [2020], again in Equateur province (DRC); and (4) and (5) the new outbreaks in the DRC and Guinea.\n\nThis invites us to ask the question: is the spillover of Ebola increasing in frequency?\n\nIf we look back at just the last 10 years, there have been 9 outbreaks of Ebola since 2010 -- almost one per year -- compared with just 18 in the preceding 38 years, or roughly one every other year.\n\nFrom this point of view, it certainly looks like Ebola outbreaks have been increasing in frequency. But another look at the timeline shows a curiosity. Ebola seems to have been in a lull with no reported human cases between 1980 and 1993. (There were, however, a few outbreaks in non-human primates in the early 1990s). Viewed this way, one might think of Ebola as having 3 epochs:\n\n1972-1979: 5 outbreaks in 8 years\n1980-1993: 0 outbreaks in 14 years\n1994-present: 22 outbreaks in 28 years.\n\nThe average time between outbreaks in each of these epochs is shown in the following figure [see URL].\n\nFrom this perspective, the frequency of outbreaks now is not meaningfully different than it was in the 1970s, when Ebola was described. So, which historical view is correct? Either way, we have a mystery to solve.\n\nIf we take the timeline view, considering each outbreak, it seems that, indeed, Ebola spillover events are increasing in frequency. Why? What is happening to cause the increase in outbreaks? One hypothesis concerns environmental change, as Ebola outbreaks seem to correlate with shifts in vegetation and the transition between dry and wet seasons. Another explanation concerns the frequency of encounters between humans and wild animals, perhaps because of land conversion or increased demand for animal protein from hunting.\n\nHowever, if we take the epochal view, grouping outbreaks into distinct periods, then there would seem to be no evidence for an increase.\n\nHowever, there is the mystery of the lull in the 1980s and early 1990s. Why would there not have been any outbreaks for 14 years when they occurred every one to 2 years on either side of this period? Did we simply miss them for some reason or were there really that many fewer outbreaks?\n\nIn either case, it is reasonable to expect that Ebola will continue to spill over into human populations. Identifying spillover risk factors, developing surveillance systems for early detection, and securing healthcare and public health resources for rapid response are needed to protect against future Ebola epidemics. Fortunately, the benefits of these investments also have a kind of \"spillover,\" providing protection not only from Ebola but other endemic and emerging diseases too.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[Alexander KA, Sanderson CE, Marathe M, et al. What Factors Might Have Led to the Emergence of Ebola in West Africa? PLoS NTD Published: 4 Jun 2015 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003652.\n\nAbstract:\n\"An Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scope emerged in West Africa in December 2013 and presently continues unabated in the countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Ebola is not new to Africa, and outbreaks have been confirmed as far back as 1976. The current West African Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded and differs dramatically from prior outbreaks in its duration, number of people affected, and geographic extent. The emergence of this deadly disease in West Africa invites many questions, foremost among these: why now, and why in West Africa? Here, we review the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that might have influenced the emergence of Ebola in this region of Africa and its spread throughout the region. Containment of the West African Ebola outbreak is the most pressing, immediate need. A comprehensive assessment of the drivers of Ebola emergence and sustained human-to-human transmission is also needed in order to prepare other countries for importation or emergence of this disease. Such assessment includes identification of country-level protocols and interagency policies for outbreak detection and rapid response, increased understanding of cultural and traditional risk factors within and between nations, delivery of culturally embedded public health education, and regional coordination and collaboration, particularly with governments and health ministries throughout Africa. Public health education is also urgently needed in countries outside of Africa in order to ensure that risk is properly understood and public concerns do not escalate unnecessarily. To prevent future outbreaks, coordinated, multiscale, early warning systems should be developed that make full use of these integrated assessments, partner with local communities in high-risk areas, and provide clearly defined response recommendations specific to the needs of each community.\"\n\nCertainly, lessons have been learned from and since the 2013 West African outbreak. In addition, vaccines are now available as are effective antivirals. Treatment of patients is greatly improved. But equally important are communication and education, which must be maintained as well as public health infrastructure. Resources should be committed to maintaining clinics, which can be used for other endemic diseases once an outbreak ends. Training of staff should continue.\n\nWith these practices, should Ebola re-emerge, the community will be well prepared to respond immediately. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nEbola update (19): Guinea (NZ), Congo DR (NK) 20210225.8212245\nEbola update (18): Guinea, Congo DR (NK), West Africa 20210224.8210083\nEbola update (17): Guinea, West Africa 20210223.8207483\nEbola update (16): Guinea, Congo DR (NK) 20210222.8205208\nEbola update (15): Guinea (KA) 20210221.8203671\nEbola update (14): Congo DR (NK), Guinea, Liberia 20210219.8202136\nEbola update (13): Liberia, Guinea, Congo DR (NK) 20210218.8199619\nEbola update (12); Guinea, Congo DR (NK) 20210218.8197835\nEbola update (11): Guinea, Congo DR (NK) 20210216.8195512\nEbola update (10): Guinea, Congo DR (NK) 20210215.8192845\nEbola update (09): Congo DR (NK), Guinea 20210214.8190818\nEbola update (08): Congo DR (NK), Guinea 20210214.8189771\nEbola update (07): Congo DR (NK) WHO 20210212.8188297\nEbola update (06): Congo DR (NK) WHO, 2nd fatal case 20210212.8186694\nEbola update (05): Congo DR (NK) fatal 20210207.8173659\nEbola update (04): long term sequelae, antibody resurgence 20210131.8151988\nEbola update (03): Ebanga monoclonal antibody 20210118.8114712\nEbola update (02): Kenya, vaccine stockpile 20210117.8110442\nEbola update (01): vaccine stockpile 20210113.8099749\n2020\n----\nEbola update (52): Congo DR (EQ) situation report, Inmazeb 20201112.7933531\nEbola update (51): Congo DR (EQ) strategies, antibody 20201105.7917308\nEbola update (50): Congo DR, case update 20201020.7877514\nEbola update (49): antibody research, treatment 20201015.7864768\nEbola update (48): Congo DR (EQ) 20201004.7835528\nEbola update (47): Congo DR (EQ) 20200922.7803256\nEbola update (46): Congo DR (EQ) 20200913.7774105\nEbola update (45): Congo DR (EQ), WHO 20200910.7765863\nEbola update (44): Congo DR (EQ) 20200907.7754938\nEbola update (43): Congo DR (EQ) WHO 20200901.7736924\nEbola update (42): Congo DR (EQ) 20200829.7726782\nEbola update (41): Congo DR (EQ) WHO 20200824.7709014\nEbola update (40): Congo DR (EQ) 20200819.7696049\nEbola update (39): Congo DR (EQ) 20200815.7682207\nEbola update (38): Congo DR (EQ) 20200808.7657868\nEbola update (37): Congo DR (EQ) 20200803.7638646\nEbola update (36): Congo DR (EQ) 20200730.7626335\nEbola update (35): Congo DR (EQ) 20200727.7614562\nEbola update (34): Congo DR (EQ) 20200724.7606487\nEbola update (33): Congo DR (EQ) 20200719.7590632\nEbola update (32): Congo DR (EQ) 20200714.7573201\nEbola update (31): Congo DR (EQ) 20200709.7558494\nEbola update (30): Congo DR (EQ) 20200704.7540595\nEbola update (20): Congo DR (NK,IT) WHO, cases, summaries, perspective 20200501.7288278\nEbola update (10): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, summaries, WHO 20200221.7012106\nEbola update (01): Congo DR (NK,IT) cases, WHO, summary, anthropology 20200105.6872195\n2019\n----\nEbola update (111): Congo DR (NK,IT) WHO, security, treatment 20191128.6801849\nEbola update (95): Congo DR (NK,IT,SK) cases, WHO, survivors, vaccine 20191003.6706383\n2018\n----\nEbola update (120): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, WHO, vaccination in pregnancy 20181027.6114985\nEbola update (73): Congo DR (NK) cases, anti-viral, research 20180821.5977639\nEbola update (28): Congo DR, cases, WHO, action 20180607.5843872\n2016\n----\nEbola update (23): comment, pregnant women, news, research 20160316.4098040\n.................................................lk/msp/mpp", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8217634", "headline": "Avian influenza, human (03): Russia, H5N8, update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8217634", "date": "2021-02-28 16:38:06", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (03): RUSSIA, H5N8, UPDATE\n*************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 26 Feb 2021\nSource: Disease Outbreak News [edited]\nhttps://www.who.int/csr/don/26-feb-2021-influenza-a-russian-federation/en/\n\n\nOn 18 Feb 2021, the National IHR Focal Point for the Russian Federation notified WHO of detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) in 7 human clinical specimens. These are the 1st reported detections of avian influenza A(H5N8) in humans.\n\nPositive clinical specimens were collected from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The laboratory confirmation of the 7 specimens was performed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR (WHO H5 Reference Laboratory). The ages of the 7 positive cases ranged between 29 to 60 years, and 5 were female.\n\nBetween 3 and 11 Dec 2020, a total of 101 000 out of 900 000 egg-laying hens on the farm died. This high mortality rate prompted an investigation. Samples were collected from these birds, and an initial detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) was performed by the Russian regional veterinary laboratory. On 11 Dec 2020, the outbreak was confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference laboratory, and the Federal Centre for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH), in Vladimir, the Russian Federation. Outbreak containment operations started immediately and continued for several days due to the large size of the poultry farm.\n\nThe cases remained asymptomatic for the whole follow up duration (several weeks). Follow up nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during the medical observation period and were tested negative for avian influenza A(H5N8). No obvious clinical manifestations were reported from any farm workers under medical surveillance, their family members, or other close contacts of the 7 cases. Additionally, acute and convalescent sera were collected from the 7 positive human cases for serological testing. The results were suggestive of recent infection.\n\nInfluenza A(H5N8) viruses isolated from this poultry outbreak in Astrakhan belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses. In 2020, avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses were also detected in poultry or wild birds in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation.\n\nOn receiving the initial signal of a probable outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at the poultry farm on 3 Dec 2020, the national authorities took immediate measures including cessation of poultry production cycles and product transportation from the affected farm.\n\nBetween 11 and 18 Dec 2020, several measures, including culling and disposing of poultry, eggs, and litter, and disinfection of contaminated premises, were taken as part of outbreak response activities.\n\nDuring and after the culling of all the poultry, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples were collected from poultry farm workers and personnel involved in outbreak response at the farm. Surveillance activities, both within and outside of the containment area, were intensified. A total of 24 close contacts of the confirmed cases have been identified and traced. In total, 150 individuals were monitored for clinical indication of respiratory disease, and they received antiviral prophylaxis therapy. No symptoms were reported among these individuals.\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing of avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses isolated from poultry and from one of the 7 human cases was performed and uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database on 20 Feb 2021. Genetic and phenotypic characterization of the virus is ongoing.\n\nWHO is following up with public health authorities in the Russian Federation, including implementation of public health measures warranted by such events, and with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) on further analysis and assessment of the virus materials and serum samples. On 20 Feb 2021, a special briefing by the head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing was organized for the state Russian media to inform the public about these cases and the implications.\n\nSince 2004, avian influenza A(H5) viruses have spread from Asia to Europe via wild birds. The genetic clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses have often reassorted among other avian influenza viruses, resulting in avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N5), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses, some of which have been detected in birds in many countries.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, avian influenza A(H5N8) of clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated for the 1st time in 2014 in a wild bird in the northern region of the Russian Far East.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, all the 7 cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. All close contacts of these cases were clinically monitored, and no one showed signs of clinical illness. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.\n\nFurther genetic and antigenic characterization and information on seroconversion among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.\n\nThe development of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses for potential use in human vaccines, coordinated by WHO, remains an essential component of the overall global strategy for influenza pandemic preparedness.\n\nBased on currently available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.\n\nThese cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza, which should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.\n\nWhen avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves, and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.\n\nDue to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.\n\nThorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.\n\nIn the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.\n\nTravelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nBased on the currently available information, WHO advises against any special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions on travel and/or trade with the Russian Federation.\n\nFor further information and details, please see:\n- Current technical information including monthly risk assessments at the Human-Animal Interface WHO\n- WHO Influenza virus infections in humans October 2018\n- Case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR (2005)\n- International Health Regulations IHR (2005)\n- Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza (2011)\n- Terms of Reference for National Influenza Centers of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The above report provides additional details about the 7 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 reported almost one week ago. No new cases have been identified since then.\n\nNow that human cases have been reported for this avian influenza subtype, preparedness for future such events requires continued monitoring and surveillance of the circulating viruses in animals and humans. - Mod.UBA]\n\n[According to the Russian report, the 7 individuals found infected by the H5N8 virus strain remained asymptomatic for the whole follow up duration. Checking persons in close contact with HPAI H5N8-affected domestic or wild birds deserves to be undertaken in other affected countries in order to get more information on the zoonotic impact of this widely-spread virus strain. The above report mentions 13 such countries. According a recent update, HPAI H5N8 in poultry and/or wild birds has been recently reported from 31 countries, of which 21 are in Europe, 8 in Asia (of which 2 are in the Middle East) and 2 in Africa.

The local people said leishmania have affected the entire area, and the disease is spreading rapidly. They said about 140 people have been affected by the disease so far, and the number of patients is increasing.\n\nPeople of the area have called upon the Health Department to send medical teams. They fear that the disease may get out of control if timely measures are not taken.\n\nDistrict Health Officer Dr Adnan said teams of Health Department workers have been sent to the affected area. He said the teams would immediately start treatment of affected persons. The health officer said all the affected persons are registered with the Health Department and that the situation would be brought under control soon.\n\nThe local people said leishmania are on the rise in the area due to lack of fumigation by the local administration. They said the Health Department must carry out fumigation and distribution of mosquito nets on an emergency basis in Bajaur to control the situation.\n\nExperts warn that the monsoon season will bring about a rise in leishmaniasis as well as malaria and dengue. According to media reports, more than 30 000 leishmania cases were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Due to the looming threat of the disease, there is a need to improve awareness among the public. Last year [2020], a shortage of leishmania injections had created problems.

MSF has also vaccinated 756 children for measles since then.\n\nAs there are cases of measles throughout the year in Chaman, MSF already supports the department of health and runs a 5-bed isolation unit inside its pediatric ward in the Qilla Abdullah DHQ hospital.\n\nIts teams started receiving significant numbers of children with measles from the end of December 2020. There were over 1000 cases of measles reported in one month in the district Qilla Abdullah.\n\nMSF medical focal point Dr. Mir Waiz said in a media briefing: \"Our emergency response to the measles outbreak in Chaman is a part of MSF's commitment to supporting the Department of Health in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters and disease outbreaks. We have opened the extended ward for a period of 2 months; however, the treatment of the children with measles will continue in our regular activities. People must take cautionary measures, including isolating patients with measles and getting them treated as soon as possible to stop the outbreak.\"\n\nMost patients recover from measles within 2-3 weeks, but in low-resource settings, up to 15 per cent of patients infected with measles die from one or more complications. Children, especially those under 5 and those who may have other immune-suppressing illnesses, such as severe malnutrition, make up most of those who die from the disease.\n\n\"As vaccination is the best protection against measles, we urge all parents to get their children vaccinated in order to stop the ongoing outbreak of measles and avoid any such emergency situation in the future.

The number of reported measles cases per year averaged approximately 29 000 during 1980-1989 and 3900 during 1990-1999.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nEstimated MCV1 coverage increased from 57% to 76% during 2000-2017, and 2nd-dose coverage increased from 30% to 45% during 2009-2017. Approximately 232.5 million children were vaccinated with MCV during 2005-2018 vaccination campaigns. Despite these efforts, MCV coverage remained well below the recommended level of 95%, and measles incidence increased during 2010-2018.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nTo achieve measles elimination, efforts are needed to increase 2-dose vaccine coverage, reach communities not accessing immunization services, and increase measles surveillance sensitivity.\n\nTo advance progress toward measles elimination in Pakistan, there is a need to raise the visibility of measles elimination efforts, including the benefits of achieving measles elimination. Without jeopardizing the focused efforts to interrupt poliovirus transmission, transitioning the substantial polio infrastructure and resources should be carefully managed to support measles elimination and broader EMR vaccination goals.\"\n\nThis report was pre-COVID; consequently, the impact of COVID is not reflected in the numbers. If the measles vaccination campaign could piggyback on the polio immunization program, that would be highly efficient and effective.

As new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants emerge, it is important to predict whether they will remain susceptible to antibody treatment.\n\nStarr et al. used a yeast library that covers all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that do not strongly disrupt binding to the host receptor (ACE2) and mapped how these mutations affect binding to 3 leading anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The maps identify mutations that escape antibody binding, including a single mutation that escapes both antibodies in the Regeneron antibody cocktail. Many of the mutations that escape single antibodies are circulating in the human population.\n\nAbstract\n\"Antibodies are a potential therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the risk of the virus evolving to escape them remains unclear. Here, we map how all mutations to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 affect binding by the antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail and the antibody LY-CoV016. These complete maps uncover a single amino acid mutation that fully escapes the REGN-COV2 cocktail, which consists of 2 antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, targeting distinct structural epitopes. The maps also identify viral mutations that are selected in a persistently infected patient treated with REGN-COV2 and during in vitro viral escape selections. Finally, the maps reveal that mutations escaping the individual antibodies are already present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. These complete escape maps enable interpretation of the consequences of mutations observed during viral surveillance.\n\nIn this study, we have completely mapped mutations that escape 3 leading anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These maps demonstrate that prior characterization of escape mutations was incomplete, having identified neither a single amino acid mutation that escapes both antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail nor most mutations that arose in a persistently infected patient treated with the cocktail. Of course, our maps still do not answer the most pressing question: Will SARS-CoV-2 evolve widespread resistance to these antibodies? But certainly, it is concerning that so many escape mutations impose little cost on RBD folding or receptor affinity and that some are already present at low levels among circulating viruses.\n\nUltimately, it will be necessary to wait and see what mutations spread as SARS-CoV-2 circulates in the human population. Our work will help with the 'seeing,' by enabling immediate interpretation of the effects of the mutations cataloged by viral genomic surveillance.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The mapping of potential escape mutants is important not only from the point of view of antibody therapy but can also help determine the efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy versus use of antibody cocktails in identified cases. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[2] Variants\n[A]\nDate: 26 Feb 2021\nSource: UW Medicine [abridged, edited]\nhttps://newsroom.uw.edu/news/single-mutation-set-recent-covid-19-variants-expansion\n\n\nA subset of patient coronavirus test samples, collected since November 2020 in 6 U.S. states, showed an increasing number of amino acid mutations in a region that helps the virus bind to host cells.\n\nAmong the rising mutations discovered in those late-fall, early winter samples, the L452R was dominant. This mutation, riding along with 4 other mutations, occurs in a recently discovered California coronavirus variant, designated CAL.20C (also goes by names B.1.427 and B.1.429), that is undergoing massive expansion across the state and is associated with many outbreaks.\n\nIn some of the samples, the researchers found another L452R-carrying virus variant that emerged more recently. It is now also circulating in California and has started to show up in across states. This variant caused the only recorded case of COVID-19 in apes by infecting a gorilla troop at the San Diego Zoo in early January 2021.\n\nIn that newer variant, designated CAL.20A (B.1.232), the L452R mutation is the only one in the spike protein that latches the virus onto cells to create a pathway to inject its genetic materials. The spike proteins are what give the coronavirus its studded, crown-like appearance.\n\nAdditional analyses have shown that several coronavirus lineages carrying L452R mutations have arisen around the world, thereby creating a global exponential increase in these types of coronavirus variants. Almost all of them were reported between December 2020 and February 2021.\n\nThe researchers determined that the L452R mutation alone triggered the emergence of the 2 California and multiple global variants.\n\nA rise in mutational variants, particularly in this part of the virus, is of public health concern because of the potential that they might make the pandemic coronavirus more infective, more virulent, or more able to escape protective antibodies, the scientists conducting the study noted.\n\nThe findings seem to suggest that the L452R, in and of itself, offers significant adaptive value to the pandemic coronavirus. From a virus evolution standpoint, positive selection for this mutation somehow became strong only in the past few months. It is not certain why this happened, but it could have occurred as the virus adapts to growing population immunity or the containment measures.\n\nHow might the mutation provide a competitive advantage for the strains of virus that carry it? The mutation exchanges arginine to replace the amino acid leucine-452, which is in direct contact with the ACE2 cell receptor for the coronavirus. This replacement is predicted to create a much stronger attachment of the virus to the human cells and also might allow it to avoid the neutralizing antibodies that try to interfere with this attachment.\n\nHowever, although evidence for such assumptions is growing, additional research is necessary to determine the exact impact of the mutation on the virus structure and function. Additional work is also needed to see how it might affect the transmissibility and infectivity of the virus, how the immune system responds to the variant, and the course and severity of disease.\n\nBecause of the possibility of a powered-up version of the virus, the authors of the study say that the L452R variants warrant close surveillance and more in-depth functional studies of how the mutation operates and how the different variants interplay.\n\nA total of 570 positive test samples from April 2020 through February 2021 were included in this particular study. They were gathered in Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n------\n[B]\nDate: 22 Feb 2021\nSource: bioRxiv [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.22.432189\n\n\nAbstract\n\"The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies.\n\nHere, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois.\n\nWe found that samples isolated since November [2020] have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation.\n\nThis mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California.\n\nIn some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently.\n\nThe newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A.\n\nWe also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape -- gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 -- is CAL.20A.\n\nIn contrast to CAL.20C that carries 2 additional L452R mutations in the spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A.\n\nAccording to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation.\n\nFurther analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020-February 2021.\n\nTaken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The lineage B1.429 is predominantly circulating in California USA (98%) but with exports to other countries, with the earliest assigned date as 30 Jun 2020.

The locations of the mutations in this variant and whether they could potentially make it more infectious or transmissible remain to be determined and, quoting the authors, warrant close surveillance and in-depth functional studies. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[3] Vaccines\nDate: 26 Feb 2021\nSource: Swiss Medic [edited]\nhttps://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/en/home/news/coronavirus-covid-19/nebenwirkungen-covid-19-impfungen-ch-update.html\n\n\nAs of 24 Feb 2021, Swiss Medic, in collaboration with the Ticino reference centre and other regional pharmacovigilance centres in particular, have evaluated 364 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) to COVID-19 vaccinations in Switzerland. The reports corroborate the side effects profile identified during the authorisation studies and described in the medicinal product information and do not as yet point to any new safety issues.\n\nAs of 24 Feb 2021, Swiss Medic had evaluated a total of 364 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) in connection with COVID-19 vaccinations in Switzerland. 199 reports involve Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnaty, while 154 are associated with Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. In 2 cases, the vaccine was not specified. The majority of reports were submitted by medical professionals, but 28 (7.7%) came directly from patients or people affected.\n\nMost reports concerned women (67%). Men were affected in 28.3% of cases, and there were a few cases (4.7%) where no gender was specified. Figure 1 shows the age distribution of the people affected. Of the 158 people aged 75 or over, 81 were between 80 and 89, while 16 were 90 or older.\n\nAbout 3/4ths of cases (74%) were not serious. The most common reactions in these cases were injection site reactions (redness, itching, pain and swelling), headaches, fever and shivering. Particularly noteworthy were the reports of delayed skin reactions around the injection site or on the skin of the arm in which the vaccine had been administered, which appeared to occur more frequently with Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine (see figures 2 and 3). Swiss Medic has already provided information on these reactions.\n\nThere were 95 serious cases (26%). The people affected were either treated in hospital, or their reactions were classified as medically significant for other reasons but were not in themselves dangerous in most cases. The most commonly reported reactions in these cases were shingles (n=8), fever (n=8), headache (n=7), COVID-19 (n=9) and allergic reactions, including 4 cases of anaphylactic reactions (see also Swiss Medic's communication of 29 Jan 2021).\n\nSince a single report generally involves more than one reaction, reactions such as fever or headache are reported in cases that are serious overall as well as in non-serious cases.\n\nIn 16 serious cases, the people concerned died at differing intervals after receiving the vaccine. Their average age was 86, and the majority of them had serious pre-existing conditions. These cases were analysed against the available information with particular care. As far as is known at the moment, death was caused by conditions such as infections, cardiovascular events, or diseases of the lungs and airways. Despite a chronological correlation, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the vaccination was the cause of death. The drug regulatory authorities of other countries and the WHO have also drawn similar conclusions when evaluating deaths with a temporal link to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe reports of adverse reactions received to date and subjected to careful analysis do not change the positive benefit-risk profile of the COVID-19 vaccines. The known side effects of COVID-19 vaccines are listed in the continually updated medicinal product information page, published at http://www.swissmedicinfo.ch.\n\nPlease note: Known, non-serious reactions are not subject to the reporting obligation prescribed by Art. 59 of the Therapeutic Products Act. The known, non-serious and very common reactions to COVID-19 vaccines include transitory pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, shivering, fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain. These passing local and general reactions are normally a sign of the body dealing with the vaccine.\n\nHowever, serious or as yet unknown adverse reactions must be reported. At this relatively early stage of the vaccination campaign, doctors should generally report all ADR that they feel are medically relevant.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[As the COVID-19 pandemic continues into 2021, vaccination is one of the most important interventional strategies. However, it is essential to have systematic and robust monitoring mechanisms in place for vaccine-associated adverse reactions, their severity, and ensuring that community awareness messages incorporate risk-versus-benefit analysis on this aspect as well. - Mod.UBA]\n\n******\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 27 Feb 2021)\nDate: Sat 27 Feb 2021\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\n\n\n*Daily case reports as of 27 Feb 2021 16:18 CET\n\nSurveillance\n------------\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\n---------------------------------------\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 1 613 598 (6565) / 28 892 (152)\nEuropean Region (61): 38 529 578 (163 763) / 849 461 (3357)\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 13 492 895 (26 038) / 207 696 (401)\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 6 360 314 (30 978) / 144 138 (341)\nRegion of the Americas (54): 50 246 580 (187 378) / 1 200 325 (6522)\nAfrican Region (49): 2 832 997 (5769) / 71 747 (166)\nCases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 745 (0) / 13 (0)\n\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\nGrand total: 113 076 707 (420 491) / 2 512 272 (10 939)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 27 Feb 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2021%20WHO%20Daily%20Tables%20Feb27_1614486944.pdf.\n\n- The Americas region reported 44.5% of daily case numbers and 59.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 50.24 million cases.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, India (17 346), Italy (18 916), Czech Republic (14 676), Poland (12 100), and Russia (11 534). A total of 47 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 47 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.\n\nComparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.6% increase in daily reported cases and a 1.3% increase in reported deaths.\n\nImpression: The global daily reported cases totaled almost 380 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 114.36 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.53 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again, unconfirmed but possibly due to the impact of the variants in circulation. - Mod.UBA]\nSee Also\nCOVID-19 update (81): transmission, reinfection, vaccine and case severity, WHO 20210227.8216798\nCOVID-19 update (80): vaccine, USA variants, comments, WHO, global 20210226.8214650\nCOVID-19 update (79): fitness facilities, variants, vs influenza, WHO, global 20210225.8213103\nCOVID-19 update (78): animal, Spain, pet ferret 20210224.8211251\nCOVID-19 update (77): vaccine effects, variants, UK vaccination impact, WHO 20210224.8210082\nCOVID-19 update (76): mutation & recomb, transmission, school, Tanzania, WHO 20210223.8207677\nCOVID-19 update (75): rapid testing, Israel vaccine results, WHO, global 20210222.8205363\nCOVID-19 update (74): vaccines, variants, genomic surveillance WHO, global 20210221.8204585\nCOVID-19 update (73): post COVID, encephalopathy, USA safety monitoring, WHO 20210220.8202495\nCOVID-19 update (72): Africa reporting, UK lockdown impact, Israel vaccine, WHO 20210219.8200334\nCOVID-19 update (71): world, animal, mink, WHO/FAO/OIE risk assessment 20210218.8200008\nCOVID-19 update (70): gangrene, challenge trials, immunity, cancer, WHO, global 20210218.8198620\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, pangolin, bat 20210211.8184900\nCOVID-19 update (50): UK vaccine study, Brazil reinfection, WHO 20210205.8167161\nCOVID-19 update (01): variants, vaccine, Thailand, global, WHO 20210101.8062938\n2020\n----\nUndiagnosed pediatric inflammatory syndrome (06): COVID-19, heart, young adults 20200522.7364506\nCOVID-19 update (562): viral load, UK vacc dose, ECDC, WHO 20201231.8061525\nCOVID-19 update (01): China, global, EVZD, reporting criteria, WHO 20200213.6984084\nNovel coronavirus (42): China, global, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, WHO 20200211.6979942\nNovel coronavirus (01): China (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU) (10): genome available, Hong Kong surveill. 20200111.6883998\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (01): (HU) wildlife sales, market closed, RFI 20200102.6866757\n2019\n----\nUndiagnosed pneumonia: China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153\nand other items in the archives\n.................................................sb/uba/msp/mpp", "reports": []}, {"archive_id": "8216716", "headline": "Lead poisoning - North America: USA, Canada, bald eagle", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8216716", "date": "2021-02-28 11:37:16", "main_text": "LEAD POISONING - NORTH AMERICA: USA, CANADA, BALD EAGLE\n*******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this post:\n[1] USA (Montana)\n[2] USA (Iowa)\n[3] USA (Maine)\n[4] Canada (Saskatchewan)\n\n******\n[1] USA (Montana)\nDate: Thu 25 Feb 2021\nSource: NBC Montana [edited]\nhttps://nbcmontana.com/news/local/several-bald-eagles-test-positive-for-lead-poisoning\n\n\nThe Montana Raptor Conservation Center reported on their Facebook page they rescued a bald eagle on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021] suffering from lead poisoning.

She says both were weak, emaciated, dehydrated and barely able to stand.\n\n\"After we received the 1st one, we knew it was a high probability of poison in that area,\" Lawrence said. \"They both lasted only about 48 hours in care before passing away.\"\n\nWith coyote carcasses in the area where the eagles were found, Lawrence suspected they [the coyotes] had been shot with lead ammunition. She says because bald eagles are scavengers, it's likely they would have eaten the carcasses. [A necropsy] later confirmed her suspicions regarding the lead poisoning.\n\nAccording to a study by the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, the number one cause of death in bald eagles in Saskatchewan is poisoning. \"We learned slightly more than 50% of bald eagles submitted to our diagnostic lab in Saskatoon here (between 1999 and 2012) died of poisonings,\" said Trent Bollinger, Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative regional director.\n\nBollinger says [those poisonings include] both insecticides and lead, with the majority of cases happening during the winter.\n\n\"Certainly, by far, the largest causes of mortality in these eagles are related to human activities,\" said Bollinger. \"We're seeing them at a time when there's lead bullets present in carcasses or animals which haven't been retrieved, or they've been dressed out and the organs are left behind which might have residues of lead shots in them.\"\n\nMore than 2 decades ago the Canadian government banned lead for hunting migratory game birds, but lead ammunition is still used for hunting large game.\n\n\"We continue to see lead poisoning in eagles and in other raptors fairly regularly,\" Bollinger said. \"It seems to be unchanged from previous years and we're also seeing this right through North America.\"\n\nLawrence says she wants to see lead banned altogether, to help prevent another tragic death. \"It's a problem in every rehab center where eagles are coming in,\" Lawrence said. \"Almost all of them will test positive for lead. So, I know we'd like to see definitely less use of lead out there.\"\n\n[Byline: Katelyn Wilson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Carcasses that have been shot with lead ammo and not retrieved are a direct source of lead pellets for scavengers. Also, in areas of heavy hunting, the lead concentration in tissues of apparently healthy prey may be very high, and this dissolved lead is then transferred to predators, scavengers, people who eat hunted birds, or to the soil and water.\n\nThe following is extracted from an article by Manning et al. at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0300985818813099\\. Please see this source URL for complete references and figures:\n\n\"Lead toxicity due to ingestion of spent ammunition is an ongoing cause of mortality in bald eagles. While gross and histologic lesions of lead intoxication have been described in a few individuals of this species, the prevalence of lesions is underreported. A retrospective study of 93 bald eagles with severe lead intoxication was performed to describe the associated lesions and their prevalence and to compare the lesions with blood, liver, kidney, and/or bone lead concentrations. Gross lesions associated with lead toxicity were most frequent within the heart (51/93 birds) and consisted of multifocal myocardial pallor and rounding of the apex. Within the brain, gross lesions included petechiae or hemorrhagic necrosis (13/93 birds). Histologic lesions compatible with lead toxicity occurred within the heart (76/93 birds), brain (59/93 birds), and eyes (24/87 birds). Lead toxicity in bald eagles is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of small- to medium-caliber arteries, most commonly affecting the heart, brain, and eyes. Gross and histologic lesions are consistent with ischemia caused by a primary vascular injury. A blood lead concentration of greater than 4 ppm and markedly elevated liver lead concentrations were associated with a greater likelihood of lesions in the heart. Severe lead intoxication is frequently associated with lesions that are histologically detectable in bald eagles. The presence of fibrinoid arterial necrosis and parenchymal degeneration, necrosis, and/or hemorrhage within the heart, brain, and/or eyes is suggestive of lead toxicity in bald eagles and warrants evaluation of liver or bone lead concentrations.\n\n\"Lead toxicity in bald eagles (_Haliaeetus leucocephalus_) is primarily associated with scavenging of carcasses or offal from animals that have been killed with lead-based ammunition (5,22,25,26,32,36,37). Lead-intoxicated bald eagles may demonstrate neurologic, ocular, gastrointestinal, and/or respiratory clinical signs or may be found deceased (8,10,14,20,25). A review of eagles submitted to the National Wildlife Health Center between 1975 and 2013 found trauma and poisonings to be the most frequent causes of death of bald eagles, with lead intoxication accounting for 63.5% of diagnosed poisonings (33).\n\n\"While elevated lead concentrations in blood, liver, kidney, and/or bone have been frequently reported in bald eagles (4,13,14,21,23,27,36,38,39), gross and histologic lesions in bald eagles with lead toxicity are mostly limited to small numbers of animals (8,23,25,30) with only one previous publication of a large series (11). Blood lead concentrations of 1 ppm or greater are considered evidence of severe incurable lead poisoning in bald eagles (36).\n\n\"Gross and histologic lesions in bald eagles with lead toxicity have been described in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and infrequently within the brain, eye, and kidney, with an underlying vascular insult suspected (6,8,23,25,30). In 5 bald eagles with experimentally induced lead toxicity, medial fibrinoid necrosis of small arterioles was occasionally observed within the ventriculus, proventriculus, liver, spleen, heart, and kidney (30). In previous reports of lead toxicity in bald eagles, there has been sporadic documentation of areas of pallor in the heart corresponding histologically to cardiomyopathy, myocardial degeneration, and/or fibrosis (11,23). Lesions within the brain of bald eagles with lead toxicity have only been infrequently reported and are grossly characterized by red to brown discoloration or red pinpoint foci (6,23).\n\n\"The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe gross and histopathologic lesions associated with severe lead toxicity (1 ppm or greater blood lead concentration), including their distribution and prevalence of lesions in a large series of bald eagles. Blood, liver, kidney, and/or bone lead concentrations were analyzed to determine if these were correlated with the presence and distribution of lesions and if blood lead concentrations were correlated with lead concentrations in the liver, kidney, or bone.\"\n- Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED maps:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106\nCanada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nLead poisoning, avian - Chile: Andean condor 20120806.1230608\nLead poisoning, avian - USA: California condor 20120629.1184945\nLead poisoning, avian - Canada (02): (NS) eagles, comment 20120110.1005482\nLead poisoning, avian - Canada: (NS) eagles 20120106.1001689\n2011\n----\nLead poisoning, avian - USA: (WA) trumpeter swan 20110204.0405\n.................................................sb/tg/rd/mpp", "reports": []}]}
