# SENG3011- We Byte

PHASE 1: API based on Promed Mail:
SwaggerHub API link: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Seng-We-Byte/We-Byte/1.0.0#/

Phase 2: 
We created a web application, called Epidemic Sandbox, for university students/researchers (our target users) who want to find relationships between different variables. Epidemic Sandbox provides visualisations, allows input of variables, performs analysis, provides predictions and creates reports on variables provided by us as well as user inputted variables. 

Our user personas, as aforementioned, are university students/researchers and our application is designed with them in mind. Our Persona 1, Matt, is a university student that is time poor, interested in connecting different variables and seeing them as visualisations but perhaps not the most familiar with data. Whereas, Persona 2, Dr. Cara, is a researcher at university and also time but she is comfortable with data and wants more personalisation and details. The user stories for this project attempt to find solutions for these wants while keeping the personaâ€™s requirements, such as an easy-to-use user interface, in mind.
