Of these cases, 183 mentioned above are classified as JE, and 148 are AES cases.\n\nAs mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nThe report above does not indicate whether any of the AES etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is well underway, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 3-4 months.\n\nAlthough mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas.

Of these cases, 183 mentioned above are classified as JE, and 148 are AES cases.\n\nAs mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nThe report above does not indicate whether any of the AES etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is well underway, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 3-4 months.\n\nAlthough mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread.

We plan to conclude it by [15 Mar 2020]. The Centre has agreed to provide around 57 lakh vaccines. We will procure the rest on our own if there is a shortfall,\" Samir Sinha, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department said. The campaign is likely to be announced in a week.\n\nOn Thursday [12 Sep 2019], while no fresh JE cases were reported, one person from Kamrup (Rural) succumbed to the disease that is spread by _Culex_ mosquitoes, according to the daily bulletin from the office of JVN Subramanyam, Director, National Health Mission (NHM), Assam.\n\nThe state recorded 614 JE positive cases in 2015, 427 in 2016, 605 in 2017 and 509 in 2018. In 2015, the number of deaths due to JE stood at 135; in 2016 the number came down to 92 and further decreased to 87 in 2017. In 2018, the state saw 94 deaths due to the vector-borne disease. In 2014, the state recorded 165 deaths due to JE.\n\nThe bulletin from NHM said till 12 Sep [2019], the total number of persons who have been affected by JE stood at 630, out of which 154 people have died. While 13 persons who died belonged to Goalpara, 11 came from Kamrup (Rural), the 2 neighbouring districts in lower Assam where maximum fatalities have been recorded this year [2019]. Kokrajhar, in Bodo Territorial Administrative District, has not reported any JE positive case for the 1st time in the last 6 years, even as the rest of the state has been affected in [the] 2019 outbreak.\n\n\"Since the last 4, 5 years were relatively calm and quiet, this year [2019] the peripheral workers seemed to be reluctant to perform their field duties properly. During my visit to Goalpara, I found that peripheral workers did not attend to cases of fever initially,\" said CR Pathak, State Programme Officer of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, explaining how the lax attitude of the ground staff may have added to the late detection and higher fatalities.\n\nPathak pointed out another reason and explained how a lot of ground staff, the multipurpose workers were involved in National Register of Citizens (NRC) duty. \"I am sure the NRC authorities also did not know that the outbreak would be severe this year. We recalled the workers in July [2019],\" he said.\n\nHealth officials also introduced urgent measures like fogging, blood sample collection of all cases of fever and sending all suspected JE cases for proper tests, treatment at civil hospitals and medical colleges, among others.\n\n\"Post July [2019] the number of fresh cases have been on a decline,\" said Pathak.\n\nSinha said, \"The last 10 deaths are all old cases.\" In September [2019], only 4 fresh cases have been recorded in the state. Unlike previous years when the disease was mostly confined to Upper Assam and North Assam, the whole state was affected this time, he said.\n\nHe said analysis also showed that the adults constituted almost 80% of the casualties. \"The writing on the wall is clear. Vaccination of persons in the age group of 15-65 is the way forward to contain it,\" Sinha said.\n\nWhile the entire state has been covered under the JE vaccination campaign for children, 14 have been covered under the adult vaccination campaign in a phased manner. Officials point out the coverage [of the] latter has not been satisfactory for a multitude of reasons, including rumours about the effects of the vaccine.\n\nRecords show even vaccination is not a foolproof way to stop the outbreak. \"This year [2019], too, 15%-20% of the casualties would be from the section which had been given JE vaccination. We know that JE vaccine is effective in around 85% of the cases and depends on immunity of the persons among other factors,\" said Pathak.\n\n[Byline: Sadiq Naqvi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[All the above cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE), with no mention of non-JE acute encephalitis syndrome that was mentioned in the previous Assam report (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689). It is not stated if the vaccine used is inactivated or a live modified one. The immunity of inactivated vaccine likely is of considerably shorter duration than a live vaccine would be.

We plan to conclude it by [15 Mar 2020]. The Centre has agreed to provide around 57 lakh vaccines. We will procure the rest on our own if there is a shortfall,\" Samir Sinha, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department said. The campaign is likely to be announced in a week.\n\nOn Thursday [12 Sep 2019], while no fresh JE cases were reported, one person from Kamrup (Rural) succumbed to the disease that is spread by _Culex_ mosquitoes, according to the daily bulletin from the office of JVN Subramanyam, Director, National Health Mission (NHM), Assam.\n\nThe state recorded 614 JE positive cases in 2015, 427 in 2016, 605 in 2017 and 509 in 2018. In 2015, the number of deaths due to JE stood at 135; in 2016 the number came down to 92 and further decreased to 87 in 2017. In 2018, the state saw 94 deaths due to the vector-borne disease. In 2014, the state recorded 165 deaths due to JE.\n\nThe bulletin from NHM said till 12 Sep [2019], the total number of persons who have been affected by JE stood at 630, out of which 154 people have died. While 13 persons who died belonged to Goalpara, 11 came from Kamrup (Rural), the 2 neighbouring districts in lower Assam where maximum fatalities have been recorded this year [2019]. Kokrajhar, in Bodo Territorial Administrative District, has not reported any JE positive case for the 1st time in the last 6 years, even as the rest of the state has been affected in [the] 2019 outbreak.\n\n\"Since the last 4, 5 years were relatively calm and quiet, this year [2019] the peripheral workers seemed to be reluctant to perform their field duties properly. During my visit to Goalpara, I found that peripheral workers did not attend to cases of fever initially,\" said CR Pathak, State Programme Officer of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, explaining how the lax attitude of the ground staff may have added to the late detection and higher fatalities.\n\nPathak pointed out another reason and explained how a lot of ground staff, the multipurpose workers were involved in National Register of Citizens (NRC) duty. \"I am sure the NRC authorities also did not know that the outbreak would be severe this year. We recalled the workers in July [2019],\" he said.\n\nHealth officials also introduced urgent measures like fogging, blood sample collection of all cases of fever and sending all suspected JE cases for proper tests, treatment at civil hospitals and medical colleges, among others.\n\n\"Post July [2019] the number of fresh cases have been on a decline,\" said Pathak.\n\nSinha said, \"The last 10 deaths are all old cases.\" In September [2019], only 4 fresh cases have been recorded in the state. Unlike previous years when the disease was mostly confined to Upper Assam and North Assam, the whole state was affected this time, he said.\n\nHe said analysis also showed that the adults constituted almost 80% of the casualties. \"The writing on the wall is clear. Vaccination of persons in the age group of 15-65 is the way forward to contain it,\" Sinha said.\n\nWhile the entire state has been covered under the JE vaccination campaign for children, 14 have been covered under the adult vaccination campaign in a phased manner. Officials point out the coverage [of the] latter has not been satisfactory for a multitude of reasons, including rumours about the effects of the vaccine.\n\nRecords show even vaccination is not a foolproof way to stop the outbreak. \"This year [2019], too, 15%-20% of the casualties would be from the section which had been given JE vaccination. We know that JE vaccine is effective in around 85% of the cases and depends on immunity of the persons among other factors,\" said Pathak.\n\n[Byline: Sadiq Naqvi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[All the above cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE), with no mention of non-JE acute encephalitis syndrome that was mentioned in the previous Assam report (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689). It is not stated if the vaccine used is inactivated or a live modified one. The immunity of inactivated vaccine likely is of considerably shorter duration than a live vaccine would be. It is unfortunate to learn that the rumor that the vaccine is not safe reduces coverage of the population at risk of infection. The price paid for this rumor is a population of increased susceptibility with more cases and deaths. A public information campaign is necessary to counteract the rumors. - Mod.TY\n\nMap of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nIndia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142\nAssam State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/299]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (AS) 20190728.6591689\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (AS) 20190720.6578446\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20190716.6570013\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (BR, AR) 20190714.6567249\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS, BR) 20190710.6561773\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (AS) 20190705.6552949\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20190703.6549201\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20190630.6544796\n2018\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.58623\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.581\n.................................................sb/dk/ty/rd/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-07-15 00:00:00", "2021-08-15 00:00:00", "2021-09-15 00:00:00", "2021-11-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2020-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2019-09-12 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-07-15 00:00:00", "2021-09-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Assam", "country": "India"}, {"location": "North Assam", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Centre", "country": "Cameroon"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "non - JE", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6663432", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Salmonellosis, st I 4,[5],12:i:- - USA (04): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6663432", "date": "2019-08-01 17:10:32", "main_text": "SALMONELLOSIS, SEROTYPE I 4,[5],12:I:- - USA (03): PIG EAR DOG TREATS, OTHER SEROTYPES\n**************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 31 Jul 2019\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, salmonella homepage, [edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/pet-treats-07-19/index.html\n\n\nOutbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ serotypes I 4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport, and London infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats. As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

As of [31 Jul 2019], a total of 127 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 33 states.\n\nState / Ill People\n----------------------\nAlabama / 1\nArizona / 1\nCalifornia / 1\nColorado / 3\nConnecticut / 1\nFlorida / 3\nGeorgia / 2\nHawaii / 1\nIllinois / 7\nIndiana / 5\nIowa / 23\nKansas / 3\nKentucky / 6\nLouisiana / 1\nMaine / 1\nMassachusetts / 4\nMichigan / 12\nMinnesota / 1\nMissouri / 6\nNew Hampshire / 1\nNew Jersey / 2\nNew Mexico / 1\nNew York / 15\nNorth Carolina / 2\nNorth Dakota / 1\nOhio / 5\nOregon / 2\nPennsylvania / 6\nSouth Carolina / 2\nTexas / 2\nUtah / 1\nWashington / 1\nWisconsin / 4\n-------------\nTotal / 127\n\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Jun 2015] to [6 Jul 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 40 years. A total of 55 (45%) ill people are female. Of 88 ill people with information available, 26 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nPredicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 71 isolates from ill people. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for one isolate; the remaining 70 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Testing of one clinical isolate using standard susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications, and may require a different choice.\n\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\n-----------------------------\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. A total of 76 (89%) of 85 ill people reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 62 people with available information, 45 (73%) reported contact with pig ear dog treats or with dogs who were fed pig ear dog treats. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.\n\nDuring the investigation, health and regulatory officials from Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and FDA collected pig ears at retail locations where ill people reported buying the products or their suppliers and distributors. Testing identified many different strains of _Salmonella_. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _S._ Infantis, _S._ London, and _S._ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation.\n\nAdditional _Salmonella_ strains were isolated from pig ears, and investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to those strains. Those strains include _S._ Panama, _S._ Brandenburg, _S._ Anatum, and _S._ Livingstone.\n\nSome of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, and Brazil. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was a another issue that led to _Salmonella_ contamination.\n\nOn [3 Jul 2019], Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [26 Jul 2019], Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On [30 Jul 2019] Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.\n\nInformation collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. CDC and FDA recommend that people do not purchase or feed any pig ear pet treats to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.\n\nThis investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A handful of the newly added cases seem to be from infections occurring between 2015-2017.\n\nAs a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.\n\nThe designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:\n- the \"I\" reflects subspecies _enterica_;\n- the \"4, [5] 12\" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;\n- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.\n- Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUnited States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106]\nSee Also\nSalmonellosis - USA (03): live poultry, multiple serotypes, fatal 20190723.6581931\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA (02): pig ear dog treats, other serotypes 20190722.6581930\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA (02): Mexican papayas, alert 20190706.6554747\nSalmonellosis, st I 4,[5,12:i:- - USA: pig ear dog treats 20190704.6551235\nSalmonellosis, st Uganda - USA: Mexican papayas, alert 20190701.6545756\nSalmonellosis - USA (02): live poultry, multiple serotypes 20190615.6522442\nSalmonellosis, st Typhimurium - USA (03): pet hedgehog 20190602.6498690\nSalmonellosis, st Braenderup & Montevideo - USA: live poultry 20190518.6472999\nSalmonellosis, st Concord - USA: tahini, alert, recall request 20190517.6471874\nSalmonellosis, st Carrau - USA (02): precut melon, CDC 20190426.6442308\nSalmonellosis, st.

State officials have said that many victims had died due to hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar.\n\nThousands of children have died of encephalitis in Bihar and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh since the 1st case was detected in the late 1970s.\n\nThe state has announced that it will bear the cost of treatment for all those affected. The Indian government has said that it will \"extend all possible support\" to the state and affected families.\n\nThe outbreak since the beginning of June [2019] has seen the most deaths in the city of Muzaffarpur.\n\nThe disease usually occurs during the monsoon season, and children are the worst affected.

But in the past decade or so, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.\n\nThe disease causes headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney. Doctors say children between the age of 6 months and 15 years are the worst affected, and 1/5 of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses.\n\n\"It is difficult to say with certainty if children are dying due to encephalitis, because there could be a number of reasons behind these deaths,\" Dr Mala Kaneria told BBC Hindi's Priyanka Dubey. \"It could also be due to malnutrition, insufficient levels of sugar and sodium, or electrolyte imbalances.\"\n\nDr Kaneria added that some of these deaths could also be caused by eating lychees on an empty stomach. Lychees contain toxins that inhibit the body's ability to produce glucose, which could affect young children whose blood sugar levels were already low because they were not eating dinner.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRaman Mahajan\nMedecins Sans Frontieres\n<msfe-delhi-epidem@barcelona.msf.org>\n\n[The number of cases of AES in the area continues to grow. A 19 Jun 2019 report indicates that the death toll has increased to 114 with more than 500 cases of AES registered since the outbreak began 1 Jun 2019, according to a government health bulletin released Wednesday [19 Jun 2019]. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 deg C / 114.5 deg F (https://federalnewsnetwork.com/health-news/2019/06/death-toll-rises-in-eastern-india-in-encephalitis-outbreak/). As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nIt has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state, and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved [dextrose administration is not mentioned in the above report]. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity, and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india).

A 19 Jun 2019 report indicates that the death toll has increased to 114 with more than 500 cases of AES registered since the outbreak began 1 Jun 2019, according to a government health bulletin released Wednesday [19 Jun 2019]. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 deg C / 114.5 deg F (https://federalnewsnetwork.com/health-news/2019/06/death-toll-rises-in-eastern-india-in-encephalitis-outbreak/). As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nIt has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state, and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved [dextrose administration is not mentioned in the above report]. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity, and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india).

A 19 Jun 2019 report indicates that the death toll has increased to 114 with more than 500 cases of AES registered since the outbreak began 1 Jun 2019, according to a government health bulletin released Wednesday [19 Jun 2019]. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 deg C / 114.5 deg F (https://federalnewsnetwork.com/health-news/2019/06/death-toll-rises-in-eastern-india-in-encephalitis-outbreak/). As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nIt has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state, and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved [dextrose administration is not mentioned in the above report]. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity, and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india).

A 19 Jun 2019 report indicates that the death toll has increased to 114 with more than 500 cases of AES registered since the outbreak began 1 Jun 2019, according to a government health bulletin released Wednesday [19 Jun 2019]. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 deg C / 114.5 deg F (https://federalnewsnetwork.com/health-news/2019/06/death-toll-rises-in-eastern-india-in-encephalitis-outbreak/). As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.\n\nIt has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state, and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved [dextrose administration is not mentioned in the above report]. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity, and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india).

Enterovirus infections have been attributed before as etiological agents of AES, but laboratory confirmations are scarce. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/364]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) 20190619.6527331\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20190614.6519707\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20190612.6515634\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR) 20190609.6510811\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01) 20190112.6255835\n2018\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (MH) 20181220.6216363\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (MP) 20181112.6141152\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (21): (AS) 20181108.6132872\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (MP) 20180827.5991109\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (BR) 20180823.5981659\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20180814.5964023\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) 20180711.5900435\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.5862346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MP) 20180614.5855342\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (HP) 20180607.5844658\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.55507\n2015\n----\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India: (BR) litchi, methylenecyclopropylglycine 20150201.3132842\n.................................................jh/ty/tw/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "dengue", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2019-06-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2019-06-19 00:00:00", "2021-05-15 00:00:00", "2021-06-15 00:00:00", "2014-06-15 00:00:00", "2019-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "KA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bihar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Muzaffarpur", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Patna", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6527331", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6527331", "date": "2018-11-12 18:06:41", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (22): (MADHYA PRADESH)\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 11 Nov 2018, 11:10 AM\nSource: The Hitavada [edited]\nhttp://thehitavada.com/Encyc/2018/11/11/8-Japanese-Encephalitis-patients-found-so-far.aspx\n\n\nGradually, hazardous diseases like Japanese encephalitis (JE) spreading its wings over the State [of Madhya Pradesh].

Currently, 8 patients of Japanese Encephalitis are found positive in Madhya Pradesh so far. Sources in the health department, on condition of anonymity, informed [us] that [there] are 8 JE patients and 3 of them are from Bhopal.\n\nA few days back a 3 year old child died of JE. Health officials have already started research about the virus around the localities of positive patients. Authorities concerned have confirmed the presence of JE virus in the areas.\n\nSources informed that [up to now] a total of 8 JE positive cases [have been] registered all across the state. The health department is taking all the necessary measures to get control over the hazardous JE virus disease.\n\nDr Himanshu Jaiswar, director [of the] State Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, talking to 'The Hitavada' said that in the wake of rising vectorborne diseases, the State Vector Borne Disease Control Department is conducting local entomological work, especially at the native lands of JE patients. He said that the vectorborne disease control department is trying to get control over JE. The department has already [commissioned] local entomological work and the health department is trying to overcome the disease as early as possible.\n\nDr Himanshu told [us what the] Vector Borne Disease Control Department is planning to do to stop JE virus. He said that the heath department is also planning to concern the Government of India to administer immunisation for the same as JE could be controlled with effective vaccination. Notably, Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).\n\nSymptoms of JE may include headache, vomiting, fever, and confusion. This occurs about 5 to 15 days after infection. JEV is generally spread by mosquitoes, specifically culex mosquitoes, pigs and wild birds. It can be prevented by Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which is both safe and effective, and by avoiding mosquito bites.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is the busy Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season in India.

AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of India:\nhttp://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/6506.\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nUttar Pradesh State, India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/322]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (MP) 20180827.5991109\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (BR) 20180823.5981659\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (AS) 20180818.5974190\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20180814.5964023\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (AS) 20180812.5961217\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (AS) 20180805.5948662\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) 20180711.5900435\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (AS) 20180701.5883729\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20180628.5881510\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10) 20180620.5866496\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20180618.5862346\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20180618.5860635\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MP) 20180614.5855342\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (HP) 20180607.5844658\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL) 20180530.5827153\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20180523.5812921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP), typhus 20180416.5749050\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.55507\n.................................................sb/mpp/ty/msp/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "1427-03-15 00:00:00", "2018-08-09 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "KA", "country": "Turkey"}, {"location": "Gorakhpur", "country": "India"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Singh", "country": "India"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5900435", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5900435", "date": "2018-06-07 15:15:44", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (06): (HIMACHAL PRADESH)\n****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 6 Jun 2018 12:40 AM\nSource: The Tribune [edited]\nhttp://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/je-virus-two-children-test-positive/600679.html\n\n\nThe Centre [source does not specify further. - Mod.SH] on [Tue 5 Jun 2018] confirmed the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Himachal, with 2 children from Solan district testing positive for the mosquitoborne viral infection of the brain.\n\nBoth children are currently in Indira Gandhi Medical Hospital, Shimla. One, a 3 year old boy from Dharampur is critical and on ventilator support. The other, a 6 year old boy from Dhalli is also under intensive care. Altogether, 7 Solan kids were referred to the IGMC, Shimla, with symptoms of viral infection, but 5 were discharged.\n\nHealth secretary Preeti Sudan told The Tribune that she had spoken to the state's principal health secretary, and directed teams from the National Centre for Disease Control and the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme to be sent to Himachal for detailed investigations into the cause of the infection.\n\nThe state surveillance officer under the Integrated Disease Control Programme had spotted symptoms of febrile illness in 7 children of Solan district and referred them to the IGMC, Shimla, suspecting Nipah virus. Their samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, to rule out Nipah and 2 of these instead tested positive for JE. \"Blood samples of these 2 children have tested positive for JE. We have now sent their cerebrospinal fluid samples to the NIV, Pune, for further investigation,\" a Health Ministry official said.\n\nHimachal has never reported JE. This is the 1st time the state has seen cases of the virus which kills 220 children under 15 pan-India every year on an average. The highest mortality rate from JE is in Uttar Pradesh where children's deaths in Gorakhpur recently sent shock waves all over the country. These deaths were primarily attributed to JE aggravated by poor healthcare facilities.\n\nSince 2010, India has seen 10 893 JE cases and 1756 deaths, a mortality rate of 17 per cent.\n\nJE has no cure. There's a preventive vaccine the government now offers under routine immunisation plan. The management of JE-infected children to minimise chances of death is the main line of care.\n\nA central multi-sectoral team rushed to Himachal will now determine whether JE infection in the state is indigenous or imported. Domestic pigs and wild birds carry the JE virus mostly transmitted by mosquitoes found around paddy fields. Mosquitoes get the infection by feeding on diseased domestic pigs and wild birds. They then further transmit the JE virus to humans.\n\n\"Central experts will have to trace the virus host and its vector -- the mosquito -- in Solan for the infection to be notified as endemic.

Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India: Changing Etiological Understanding.\n\nAbstract\nSeasonal outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with high case fatality have been occurring in Gorakhpur division in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, for more than 3 decades. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounted for less than 10 percent of AES cases, while the etiology of the remaining cases remained largely unknown. Investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks indicated _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (Haruo Hayashi 1920) (Norio Ogata 1929) Tamura et al. 1995 (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) as the etiology in about 60 percent of AES cases. Hospital-based surveillance studies indicated that about 1/5th of the patients with acute febrile illness [AFI] were due to scrub typhus. Further studies are required to identify the etiology of about 1/3rd of AES cases that test negative for scrub typhus, JEV, or dengue.\n\nConclusions and way forward\nThe evidence available since 2014 indicates _O. tustsugamushi_ as the leading etiology of AES cases, accounting for over 60 percent of AES cases. In contrast, during this period, JEV accounted for only about 10 percent AES cases. The key strategies for AES control in the region needs to include 1) reducing incidence by maintaining high coverage of JEV vaccine as well as removing the misconception of vaccinators about simultaneous administration of vaccines, 2) administering doxycycline/Azithromycin to suspected scrub typhus patients attending peripheral health facilities, thereby preventing the progression of AFI to AES, and 3) reducing mortality by administering Azithromycin to all hospitalized AES patients. ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has initiated several studies in the region to understand the epidemiology of scrub typhus. These include 1) entomological studies to characterize mite species present on rodents, 2) serological and molecular studies on rodent sera and mite pools for documenting _O. tsutsugamushi_ infection, 3) surveys to estimate the sero-prevalence of antibodies against _O. tsutsugamushi_ in human population, 4) studies to identify risk factors for acquiring scrub typhus, and 5) studies to identify factors associated with the progression of febrile illness to AES.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Occurrence of encephalitis cases in northeastern India, and especially in Uttar Pradesh state, has been a significant public health problem for many years. A report cited in an earlier ProMED-mail post (Japanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774) stated that in 2017, there were 4759 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases with 595 deaths. JE cases in 2017 were 677 with 81 deaths. This came after the health department claimed it had carried out a mass immunization campaign in 38 AES-JE endemic districts in May and June [2017], covering over 9.1 million children in the age group of 1-15 years.\n\nAlthough Japanese encephalitis virus is endemic in Uttar Pradesh state and other areas in eastern India, it is frequently shown to be responsible for a minor proportion of encephalitis cases in children, the majority being classified as AES of undetermined etiology.\n\nThe determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. The above retrospective study indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases. The rationale for posting this published report of retrospective studies is that one hopes that these findings may stimulate prospective studies by ICMR and other scientists as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children is now beginning in northeastern India and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year [2018].\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142 and Uttar Pradesh State, India at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/322. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774\n2017\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (UP) 20171106.54263192011\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20171010.5369812\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP), RFI 20170916.5320148\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) 20170902.5290553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment 20170830.5283261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\n.................................................ty/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "dengue", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "1995-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "4759-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "UP", "country": "South Korea"}, {"location": "KA", "country": "Turkey"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5827153", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (KL)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5827153", "date": "2018-04-16 13:15:31", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (02): (UTTAR PRUDISH), TYPHUS\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 4 Apr 2018\nSource: Journal of Medical Entomology [edited]\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jme/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjy042/4955586\n\n\nManoj Murhekar, Jeromie Wesley, Vivian Thangaraj, Mahima Mittal, Nivedita Gupta. Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India: Changing Etiological Understanding.\n\nAbstract\nSeasonal outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with high case fatality have been occurring in Gorakhpur division in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, for more than 3 decades. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounted for less than 10 percent of AES cases, while the etiology of the remaining cases remained largely unknown. Investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks indicated _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (Haruo Hayashi 1920) (Norio Ogata 1929) Tamura et al. 1995 (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) as the etiology in about 60 percent of AES cases. Hospital-based surveillance studies indicated that about 1/5th of the patients with acute febrile illness [AFI] were due to scrub typhus. Further studies are required to identify the etiology of about 1/3rd of AES cases that test negative for scrub typhus, JEV, or dengue.\n\nConclusions and way forward\nThe evidence available since 2014 indicates _O. tustsugamushi_ as the leading etiology of AES cases, accounting for over 60 percent of AES cases. In contrast, during this period, JEV accounted for only about 10 percent AES cases. The key strategies for AES control in the region needs to include 1) reducing incidence by maintaining high coverage of JEV vaccine as well as removing the misconception of vaccinators about simultaneous administration of vaccines, 2) administering doxycycline/Azithromycin to suspected scrub typhus patients attending peripheral health facilities, thereby preventing the progression of AFI to AES, and 3) reducing mortality by administering Azithromycin to all hospitalized AES patients. ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has initiated several studies in the region to understand the epidemiology of scrub typhus. These include 1) entomological studies to characterize mite species present on rodents, 2) serological and molecular studies on rodent sera and mite pools for documenting _O. tsutsugamushi_ infection, 3) surveys to estimate the sero-prevalence of antibodies against _O. tsutsugamushi_ in human population, 4) studies to identify risk factors for acquiring scrub typhus, and 5) studies to identify factors associated with the progression of febrile illness to AES.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Occurrence of encephalitis cases in northeastern India, and especially in Uttar Pradesh state, has been a significant public health problem for many years.

The rationale for posting this published report of retrospective studies is that one hopes that these findings may stimulate prospective studies by ICMR and other scientists as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children is now beginning in northeastern India and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year [2018].\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142 and Uttar Pradesh State, India at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/322. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (KA, UP) 20180110.5550774\n2017\n----\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (23): (UP) 20171106.54263192011\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (22): (UP) 20171010.5369812\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (UP), RFI 20170916.5320148\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (UP) 20170902.5290553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): comment 20170830.5283261\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20170825.5273513\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (UP) AES due to scrub typhus 20170817.5255252\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14) 20170816.5252801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20170807.5234297\n.................................................ty/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "dengue", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "1995-03-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "4759-03-15 00:00:00", "2017-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "UP", "country": "South Korea"}, {"location": "KA", "country": "Turkey"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5452732", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (25): (MP)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5452732", "date": "2017-09-28 15:35:35", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (21): (MAHARASHTRA)\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 27 Sep 2017, 11:57 PM IST\nSource: The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/woman-with-je-citys-fourth-case-in-11-months/articleshow/60861880.cms\n\n\nAlready struggling to rein in the rising number of dengue and chikungunya cases, residents must now gear up to combat another mosquito-borne disease; Japanese encephalitis (JE).

In the last 2 days, 16 new cases of AES and 3 deaths were reported from Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, the largest in the district. However, the hospital and district health officials are claiming that the situation is much better than in the previous years.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the Gorakhpur district, and eastern Uttar Pradesh state generally, have been localities of many cases of JE and AES in recent years, this is the 1st report from those locations this year (2017).\n\nAs with cases of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh and other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined.\n\nThe above report does not indicate whether JE vaccination campaigns have been active there this year [2017]. Other etiologies for AES, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), lychee fruit consumption, and agricultural-related toxicants have been proposed. The above report does not indicate what the etiologies of the AES cases might be.

It has affected 313 persons, mostly children, and claimed 10 lives in Odisha till the end of May this year [2017].\n\nWhile 3 deaths have been reported from Khurda district and 2 from Balasore, one each has died in Kendrapara, Jajpur, Nayagarh, Puri and Sambalpur.\n\nAs per the statistics available from the directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), no deaths have been reported from Japanese encephalitis (JE); though 313 AES cases have been diagnosed so far, 2 have been found to be JE positive.\n\nOdisha is, in fact, the 4th state -- after Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam -- which has recorded the maximum number of deaths due to AES. Uttar Pradesh has registered the highest number, 56 deaths, followed by 49 in WB and 32 in Assam. Though Tamil Nadu has registered the highest at 401 cases, no deaths have been reported in the southern state this year [2017].\n\nJoint Director of Health Services (NVBDCP) Dr MM Pradhan said AES is a growing concern in the country, as it is a clinical neurologic manifestation caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins.\n\n\"Management of AES including JE is essentially symptomatic. It is important to identify early warning signs and refer patients to health facilities for treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Health workers have been educated for 1st line management of such cases at the grassroots level,\" he said.\n\nThere are many AES-causing viruses for which neither vaccines nor medicines are available. In many cases, people affected with AES suffer from brain aspiration [meaning unclear - Mod.JH] and edema, which develop as a result of an inflammatory reaction in brain. It is difficult to survive if such cases are not treated early.\n\nThe Health Department has alerted people to remain cautious, as early detection and treatment are 2 possible methods to put a check on AES. \"Since there is no particular medicine for the disease, we are adopting symptomatic treatment. Awareness activities have also been increased and health workers deployed at the periphery to spread awareness,\" Dr Pradhan said.\n\nAfter the spurt in AES and JE cases last year [2016], 10 sentinel laboratories were set up in the state for immediate diagnosis of blood samples. These laboratories have been provided with JE kits supplied by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology.\n\nThe Health authorities have also planned to train all treating paediatric specialists to deal with encephalitis cases. They will be imparted training at AIIMS next month [June 2017].\n\nLast year [2016], out of 1096 AES cases, 115 persons died of AES, and 42 children died of JE. Most of the cases were reported from Malkangiri district. Along with Malkangiri, mass vaccination was carried out in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Jajpur districts in campaign mode.

It has affected 313 persons, mostly children, and claimed 10 lives in Odisha till the end of May this year [2017].\n\nWhile 3 deaths have been reported from Khurda district and 2 from Balasore, one each has died in Kendrapara, Jajpur, Nayagarh, Puri and Sambalpur.\n\nAs per the statistics available from the directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), no deaths have been reported from Japanese encephalitis (JE); though 313 AES cases have been diagnosed so far, 2 have been found to be JE positive.\n\nOdisha is, in fact, the 4th state -- after Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam -- which has recorded the maximum number of deaths due to AES. Uttar Pradesh has registered the highest number, 56 deaths, followed by 49 in WB and 32 in Assam. Though Tamil Nadu has registered the highest at 401 cases, no deaths have been reported in the southern state this year [2017].\n\nJoint Director of Health Services (NVBDCP) Dr MM Pradhan said AES is a growing concern in the country, as it is a clinical neurologic manifestation caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins.\n\n\"Management of AES including JE is essentially symptomatic. It is important to identify early warning signs and refer patients to health facilities for treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Health workers have been educated for 1st line management of such cases at the grassroots level,\" he said.\n\nThere are many AES-causing viruses for which neither vaccines nor medicines are available. In many cases, people affected with AES suffer from brain aspiration [meaning unclear - Mod.JH] and edema, which develop as a result of an inflammatory reaction in brain. It is difficult to survive if such cases are not treated early.\n\nThe Health Department has alerted people to remain cautious, as early detection and treatment are 2 possible methods to put a check on AES. \"Since there is no particular medicine for the disease, we are adopting symptomatic treatment. Awareness activities have also been increased and health workers deployed at the periphery to spread awareness,\" Dr Pradhan said.\n\nAfter the spurt in AES and JE cases last year [2016], 10 sentinel laboratories were set up in the state for immediate diagnosis of blood samples. These laboratories have been provided with JE kits supplied by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology.\n\nThe Health authorities have also planned to train all treating paediatric specialists to deal with encephalitis cases. They will be imparted training at AIIMS next month [June 2017].\n\nLast year [2016], out of 1096 AES cases, 115 persons died of AES, and 42 children died of JE. Most of the cases were reported from Malkangiri district. Along with Malkangiri, mass vaccination was carried out in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Jajpur districts in campaign mode.

We are studying why it is happening.\"\n\n\"All children in the district will be vaccinated against JE on [1 Dec 2016],\" Odisha director of health services Dr Chittaranjan Nayak said. \"The process of procuring the vaccines from the Centre, training the staff and the logistical assessment has begun.\"\n\nA single shot protects children for up to a year against the JE [virus] strain prevalent in India.\n\nWhile JE is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes, AES can be caused by a range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, chemicals, and toxins. Encephalitis is marked by inflammation of the brain's membrane that causes rapidly rising fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.\n\nOdisha first reported encephalitis cases in 2015, when 660 AES cases and 33 JE cases were detected. There were 4 deaths, 2 from each.\n\n\"Children in Malkangiri have never been vaccinated against JE because there were no cases till now,\" says Dr Nayak. Till [2 Oct 2016], India reported 7443 AES cases and 840 deaths, while JE has infected another 974 people and killed 167. Of these, 456 AES and 16 JE cases were from Odisha.\n\n[Byline: Sanchita Sharma]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of encephalitis cases in the district continues to slowly increase. This is the 2nd time that acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been mentioned. Until now, almost all the encephalitis cases have been attributed to JE virus infections. AES cases go undiagnosed. When JE virus infection is ruled out, other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. Until definitive etiologies of AES are identified, appropriate treatment and control measures cannot be implemented. One hopes that the studies that Dr Madan Mohan Pradhan mentioned will determine the etiologies involved.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY\n\n******\n[2] Vaccination training\nDate: Tue 2 Nov 2016\nSource: Prameya News7 [edited]\nhttp://www.prameyanews7.com/en/nov2016/odisha/35541/Training-to-vaccinators-for-JE-immunisation-begins-JE-immunisationOdisha.htm\n\n\nThe National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) authorities on [Wed 26 Oct 2016] started imparting training to nodal officers of 4 [Odisha] districts, Malkangiri, Koraput, Keonjhar, and Jajpur to carry out immunization programme to tackle deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE).\n\nThe deadly disease so far claimed the lives of 82 children in Malkangiri district. [According to the report above, less than half of these cases are due to JE virus infection. - Mod.TY]\n\nThe exact date of vaccination is yet to be decided by the NVBDCP, but it is believed that vaccination drive against Japanese encephalitis (JE), a dreadful disease, would be organised either in the last week of November or 1st week of December [2016].\n\nAs part of vaccination drive, children in the age group of 1-15 [years] would be covered across the 4 districts. Action plan has drawn for effective implementation of JE vaccination programme in these districts.\n\nVaccine camps would be set up in Government schools besides Anganwadi centres [Anganwadi centers provide basic health care in Indian villages. - Mod.TY]. Children in the age group of 1-15 years are prone to Japanese encephalitis attack and there is no medicine to cure this viral disease.

We are studying why it is happening.\"\n\n\"All children in the district will be vaccinated against JE on [1 Dec 2016],\" Odisha director of health services Dr Chittaranjan Nayak said. \"The process of procuring the vaccines from the Centre, training the staff and the logistical assessment has begun.\"\n\nA single shot protects children for up to a year against the JE [virus] strain prevalent in India.\n\nWhile JE is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes, AES can be caused by a range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, chemicals, and toxins. Encephalitis is marked by inflammation of the brain's membrane that causes rapidly rising fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.\n\nOdisha first reported encephalitis cases in 2015, when 660 AES cases and 33 JE cases were detected. There were 4 deaths, 2 from each.\n\n\"Children in Malkangiri have never been vaccinated against JE because there were no cases till now,\" says Dr Nayak. Till [2 Oct 2016], India reported 7443 AES cases and 840 deaths, while JE has infected another 974 people and killed 167. Of these, 456 AES and 16 JE cases were from Odisha.\n\n[Byline: Sanchita Sharma]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of encephalitis cases in the district continues to slowly increase. This is the 2nd time that acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been mentioned. Until now, almost all the encephalitis cases have been attributed to JE virus infections. AES cases go undiagnosed. When JE virus infection is ruled out, other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. Until definitive etiologies of AES are identified, appropriate treatment and control measures cannot be implemented. One hopes that the studies that Dr Madan Mohan Pradhan mentioned will determine the etiologies involved.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY\n\n******\n[2] Vaccination training\nDate: Tue 2 Nov 2016\nSource: Prameya News7 [edited]\nhttp://www.prameyanews7.com/en/nov2016/odisha/35541/Training-to-vaccinators-for-JE-immunisation-begins-JE-immunisationOdisha.htm\n\n\nThe National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) authorities on [Wed 26 Oct 2016] started imparting training to nodal officers of 4 [Odisha] districts, Malkangiri, Koraput, Keonjhar, and Jajpur to carry out immunization programme to tackle deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE).\n\nThe deadly disease so far claimed the lives of 82 children in Malkangiri district. [According to the report above, less than half of these cases are due to JE virus infection. - Mod.TY]\n\nThe exact date of vaccination is yet to be decided by the NVBDCP, but it is believed that vaccination drive against Japanese encephalitis (JE), a dreadful disease, would be organised either in the last week of November or 1st week of December [2016].\n\nAs part of vaccination drive, children in the age group of 1-15 [years] would be covered across the 4 districts. Action plan has drawn for effective implementation of JE vaccination programme in these districts.\n\nVaccine camps would be set up in Government schools besides Anganwadi centres [Anganwadi centers provide basic health care in Indian villages. - Mod.TY]. Children in the age group of 1-15 years are prone to Japanese encephalitis attack and there is no medicine to cure this viral disease.

Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus, mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors, and pigs are amplifying hosts.\n\nMaps of India can be accessed at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18170. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR) 20161003.4533613\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (OR) 20160929.4525723\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (18): (OR) 20160927.4517725\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (JH) confirmation 20160926.4516189\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16) 20160926.4514686\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (JH), RFI 20160921.4503861\nJapanese encephalitis (02): India, Nepal 20160905.4467223\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (TR) 20160903.4462527\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (12): (BR,UP) 20160902.4459866\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (UP) 20160824.4438801\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (AS) 20160820.4430470\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (09): (AS) 20160803.4390885\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (MN) 20160801.4383765\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (MN, OR) 20160725.4368952\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (JH) susp 20160721.4361308\nJapanese encephalitis: Philippines (DR), Viet Nam, India (KL,BR) 20160716.4350209\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (BR) fatal 20160627.4312442\nJapanese encephalitis and other - India (04): (AS) 20160618.4295497\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (AS) 20160614.4287590\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (AS) 20160613.4283791\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India: (UP) 20160103.3908735\n.................................................ty/mj/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2016-09-15 00:00:00", "2016-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Philippines", "country": "Philippines"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DR", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "CDMO", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "Vietnam"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4533613", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (20): (OR)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4533613", "date": "2016-09-03 12:25:44", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (13): (TRIPURA)\n*******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 2 Sep 2016\nSource: The Northeast Today [edited]\nhttp://thenortheasttoday.com/tripura-43-japanese-encephalitis-cases-recorded-in-four-months/\n\n\nAt least 43 cases of Japanese encephalitis were recorded across Tripura in the last 4 months as per a report.

We have to maintain strict vigil,\" said civil surgeon Dr S.K. Jha.\n\nSahir Pall, district officer for the Centre's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), said the private hospital had reported 4 Japanese encephalitis [JE] suspects. \"Blood serum samples have been sent to the microbiology department of MGM Medical College in Dimna for confirmation. Reports are expected in another 48 hours,\" Pall added.\n\nSources at TMH said all the 4 encephalitis suspects were children -- 3 boys and a girl aged between 4-12 years.\n\n\"The patients have come from various parts of Jamshedpur like Birsanagar, Sakchi, Sonari, Kadma, Mango and Bagbera as well as Adityapur in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district.\n\nJapanese encephalitis [virus] is transmitted to humans through infected _Culex_ mosquitoes, particularly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_.\n\nOf the 200-plus samples tested for Japanese encephalitis in 2015, 40 had confirmed presence of the virus.

Prevention and control of AES will be difficult until there is a clear indication of the etiologies involved in these cases. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/46246.]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15) 20150930.3681239\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (BR) 20150917.3651976\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13): (UP) susp. 20150914.3642980\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India, Nepal 20150912.3641072\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20150909.3633134\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (ML) 20150819.3590146\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (ML,AS) 20150815.3581103\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (TN) 20150808.3566596\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (AS) 20150729.3545979\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (AS) vaccine 20150724.3534646\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20150722.3529096\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (WB) 20150715.3513485\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (AS) RFI 20150714.3510678\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (WB): 20150710.3499921\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (JH) susp. 20150409.3287355\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India (02): Methlyenecyclopropylglycine, commentary 20150225.3183897\nEncephalopathy, hypoglycemia - India: (BR) litchi, methylenecyclopropylglycine 20150201.3132842\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (01): (AS) 20150128.3126931\n.................................................ty/pg/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2011-03-15 00:00:00", "2009-03-15 00:00:00", "2011-03-15 00:00:00", "2009-03-15 00:00:00", "2015-09-15 00:00:00", "2014-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3681239", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (15)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3681239", "date": "2015-08-08 21:34:40", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS & OTHER - INDIA (09): (TAMIL NADU)\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 8 Aug 2015\nSource: The New Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Four-year-old-Dies-of-Japanese-Encephalitis/2015/08/08/article2963400.ece\n\n\nIn a rare case of Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne disease, a 4-year-old boy from Keezhlsathamangalur near Ariyur here died at the Institute of Child Health in Chennai on 1 Aug [2015].\n\nInitially, the boy was administered rabies vaccine at Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Post Graduate Institute (IGMCRI) after being bitten by a stray dog, but subsequently the family took him to the JIPMER [Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research].\n\nWhen the boy developed fever and complications, suspecting it to be a case of rabies encephalopathy, JIPMER referred the boy to Rajiv Gandhi Women and Children Hospital on 27 Jul 2015.

The disease, which in 2009 was recorded in only half of the state's districts, now is seen in all of them.\n\nDoctors say climate change has played a major role in the spread of the disease, which once appeared largely from May to July but now is seen as late in the year as November, as mosquitoes survive longer in warmer conditions.\n\nJapanese encephalitis is characterized by inflammation of the brain and high fever.\n\n\"Now, the temperature ... which is ideal for breeding of the _Culex_ mosquito, is present almost until October or so, and as a result of this, the cases of the disease are increasing,\" said Rabindra Nath Talukdar, a senior official of the Assam health department.\n\n\"Initially, it was only an upper Assam disease ... but now it has also been detected in lower Assam districts, and (now) cases have been reported from all the 27 districts in Assam,\" Talukdar said.\n\nHealth department officials said changes in agricultural patterns may be affecting the rise in encephalitis cases. Warmer conditions have allowed farmers to grow more crops of rice each year, which means rice paddies with standing water offer a breeding ground for mosquitoes for a larger part of each year. \"The _Culex_ mosquito breeds on water in the agricultural land, and now since there is water on the field for several more months than before, it gives more time and space for the mosquito to breed,\" Talukdar said.\n\nFaced with a surge in Japanese encephalitis cases, the Assam government has announced measures to tackle the problem, including more careful monitoring of cases. Assam Health Minister Nazrul Islam described the situation as \"a huge concern. I have asked the senior officials of the health department to monitor the situation carefully and to report to me on a regular basis,\" he said.\n\nFaced with a growing public outcry over the disease's rapid spread, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has ordered officials of the Assam health department to develop a plan to control the disease.\n\nPlans should include \"setting up of an intensive care unit in each district hospital for treatment of emergency cases, along with laboratory testing units,\" Gogoi said. As well, \"I have already asked the health department to procure laboratory testing kits for quick diagnosis of the disease, adequate vaccines and medicines for the hospitals, and also to carry out intensive fogging in the affected areas,\" he said.\n\nCivil society groups and activists have, however, questioned why such steps were not taken earlier. \"The data from the state health department itself shows that the disease has taken a deadly turn over the years in the state. Unfortunately, the state machinery waited for the disease to go out of control, whereas it should have taken steps to control the disease much earlier,\" said Sankar Prasad Rai, of the All Assam Students Union (AASU).\n\nSeveral influential student groups of the state, including the All Assam Students Union and the Assam Jatiyatibadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), have staged protests over the government's failure to control the spread of Japanese encephalitis.\n\n[Byline: Amarjyoti Borah]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, have been proposed.\n\nThe above report indicates that the cases referred to in Assam are JE. Increased surveillance, coupled with timely laboratory support, is very important for any control efforts to be successful. Although delivery of JE virus vaccine to hospitals is mentioned, it is curious that no mention is made of an Assam-wide vaccination campaign, nor is there mention of campaigns in previous years. Vaccination is more likely to be more effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly with the increase in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India.

He was noted to have confused speech and seizures on 1 Aug [2014] and was taken to the AED of TMH again. He was admitted for further management on the same day. The patient is now afebrile in stable condition.\n\nHis cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens tested positive for antibodies against JE [virus antigens] today [6 Aug 2014] upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.\n\nInitial enquiries revealed that the patient lives in the quarters of Crossroads Foundation near Gold Coast, Tuen Mun, and had no recent travel history during the incubation period.\n\nHe could not recall any recent mosquito bites. His family contact has remained asymptomatic and will be put under medical surveillance. The CHP's investigations are ongoing.\n\nOfficers of the CHP will conduct home visits and surveys among neighbours of the patient's residence for active case finding and arranging of blood tests.\n\nThe CHP's hotline (2125 1122), set up for public enquiries since the 1st local confirmed JE case, will operate till 9 pm today and from 9 am to 6 pm from tomorrow (7 Aug 2014] onwards.\n\nA health talk will be held at Crossroads Foundation this evening to deliver health advice to the public. Residents of Tuen Mun District with JE symptoms are also advised to promptly seek medical attention.\n\nThe CHP will issue letters to doctors and hospitals to draw their attention to the case and enlist their support in early diagnosis, control and prevention of JE.\n\nThis is the 4th JE case (3 local, one imported) reported to the CHP this year. In 2013, 6 cases (2 local, 3 imported, one unclassified) were reported in 2013 while 3 (one local, 2 imported) were filed in 2012.\n\n\"JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal. It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches, and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields. The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus, and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE is endemic on the Mainland and in Southeast Asia,\" a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nMost JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. More severe infections are clinically characterised by the quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants) and paralysis.\n\nTo avoid contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:\n- wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved clothes and trousers;\n- use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothing when outdoors; and\n- use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.\n\nTravellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:\n- avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;\n- apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and\n- consider vaccination and arrange a travel health consultation with a doctor to determine the need for vaccination and vector preventive measures at least 6 weeks before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for stays of over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As the report above indicates, there have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong (see ProMED-mail archives listed below). There have been 3 cases previously reported this year (2014) in Hong Kong. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites. JEV vaccine is available in China, but there is no mention about the immunization status of the above 2014 cases, although there is a recommendation for people to be vaccinated if they are going to be in a high risk area for a month or more.

He was noted to have confused speech and seizures on 1 Aug [2014] and was taken to the AED of TMH again. He was admitted for further management on the same day. The patient is now afebrile in stable condition.\n\nHis cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens tested positive for antibodies against JE [virus antigens] today [6 Aug 2014] upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.\n\nInitial enquiries revealed that the patient lives in the quarters of Crossroads Foundation near Gold Coast, Tuen Mun, and had no recent travel history during the incubation period.\n\nHe could not recall any recent mosquito bites. His family contact has remained asymptomatic and will be put under medical surveillance. The CHP's investigations are ongoing.\n\nOfficers of the CHP will conduct home visits and surveys among neighbours of the patient's residence for active case finding and arranging of blood tests.\n\nThe CHP's hotline (2125 1122), set up for public enquiries since the 1st local confirmed JE case, will operate till 9 pm today and from 9 am to 6 pm from tomorrow (7 Aug 2014] onwards.\n\nA health talk will be held at Crossroads Foundation this evening to deliver health advice to the public. Residents of Tuen Mun District with JE symptoms are also advised to promptly seek medical attention.\n\nThe CHP will issue letters to doctors and hospitals to draw their attention to the case and enlist their support in early diagnosis, control and prevention of JE.\n\nThis is the 4th JE case (3 local, one imported) reported to the CHP this year. In 2013, 6 cases (2 local, 3 imported, one unclassified) were reported in 2013 while 3 (one local, 2 imported) were filed in 2012.\n\n\"JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal. It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches, and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields. The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus, and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE is endemic on the Mainland and in Southeast Asia,\" a spokesman for the CHP explained.\n\nMost JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. More severe infections are clinically characterised by the quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants) and paralysis.\n\nTo avoid contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:\n- wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved clothes and trousers;\n- use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothing when outdoors; and\n- use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.\n\nTravellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:\n- avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;\n- apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and\n- consider vaccination and arrange a travel health consultation with a doctor to determine the need for vaccination and vector preventive measures at least 6 weeks before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for stays of over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As the report above indicates, there have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong (see ProMED-mail archives listed below). There have been 3 cases previously reported this year (2014) in Hong Kong. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites.

But the episodes were just a tiny fraction of the hundreds that have occurred in recent years across a sprawling web of academic, commercial and government labs that operate without clear national standards or oversight, federal reports show.\n\nSpurred by the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001, an increase in \"high-level containment\" labs set up to work with risky microbes has raised the number to about 1500 from a little more than 400 in 2004, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nYet there has never been a national plan for how many of them are needed, or how they should be built and operated. The more of these labs there are, the G.A.O. warned Congress last week, the greater the chances of dangerous blunders or sabotage, especially in a field where oversight is \"fragmented and largely self-policing.\"\n\nAs the labs have multiplied, so have mishaps. According to a 2012 article by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of reported accidents involving microbes that can cause severe illnesses grew rapidly, from just 16 in 2004 to 128 in 2008 and 269 in 2010, the last year reported. Many of the accidents involved leaks, spills or other releases of infectious material inside the laboratories, potentially infecting workers and often requiring extensive decontamination.\n\nAnother report, by the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, provided a rare glimpse into the types of accidents that have occurred at high-level labs around the country, often at universities.\n\nLab workers at different sites accidentally jabbed themselves with needles contaminated by anthrax or West Nile virus.

But the episodes were just a tiny fraction of the hundreds that have occurred in recent years across a sprawling web of academic, commercial and government labs that operate without clear national standards or oversight, federal reports show.\n\nSpurred by the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001, an increase in \"high-level containment\" labs set up to work with risky microbes has raised the number to about 1500 from a little more than 400 in 2004, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nYet there has never been a national plan for how many of them are needed, or how they should be built and operated. The more of these labs there are, the G.A.O. warned Congress last week, the greater the chances of dangerous blunders or sabotage, especially in a field where oversight is \"fragmented and largely self-policing.\"\n\nAs the labs have multiplied, so have mishaps. According to a 2012 article by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of reported accidents involving microbes that can cause severe illnesses grew rapidly, from just 16 in 2004 to 128 in 2008 and 269 in 2010, the last year reported. Many of the accidents involved leaks, spills or other releases of infectious material inside the laboratories, potentially infecting workers and often requiring extensive decontamination.\n\nAnother report, by the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, provided a rare glimpse into the types of accidents that have occurred at high-level labs around the country, often at universities.\n\nLab workers at different sites accidentally jabbed themselves with needles contaminated by anthrax or West Nile virus. An air-cleaning system meant to filter dangerous microbes out of a lab failed, but no one knew because the alarms had been turned off. A batch of West Nile virus, improperly packed in dry ice, burst open at a Federal Express shipping center. Mice infected with bubonic plague or Q fever went missing. And workers exposed to Q fever, brucellosis or tuberculosis did not realize it until they either became ill or blood tests detected the exposure.\n\nThe good news is that relatively few lab workers have become ill from accidental exposures: only 11 from 2004 to 2010, according to the CDC report. None died, and none infected other people.\n\nRichard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist and laboratory director from Rutgers University, said he had \"no confidence\" in the safety of the many labs that have sprung up since 2001. He suggested there was a culture of complacency at some of them, as well as hubris among some researchers who believe they do not need oversight or management.\n\nThe most recent revelations have underscored potentially serious lapses at the government's premier institutions. In June 2014, dozens of CDC employees may have been exposed to live anthrax. In another case disclosed this month [July 2014], a CDC lab accidentally contaminated a relatively benign flu sample with a dangerous H5N1 bird flu strain that has killed 386 people since 2003 and then shipped it to a lab at the Department of Agriculture. In yet another episode this month [July 2014], vials of smallpox and other infectious agents were discovered in a government laboratory on the campus of the National Institutes of Health after being stored and apparently forgotten about 50 years ago.\n\n6 or 7 government agencies were involved in the growth spurt of labs across the country focusing on dangerous pathogens, with no overall strategic plan, according to Nancy Kingsbury, the managing director of applied research and methods at the GAO, who testified last week before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.\n\nFor years, the accountability office has warned that there was no one federal agency overseeing all the laboratories. In fact, it has said, the real number of high-level labs is not even known because the only ones required to register with the government are those handling \"select agents,\" microbes that can cause serious illness in people, animals or crops. Other high-level labs handle pathogens that may be dangerous but are not listed as select agents, the office said, adding that not much is known about them.\n\n[Readers are encouraged to read the complete article on the NY Times website. - Mod.MHJ]\n\n[Byline: Denise Grady]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a parallel viewpoint from the UK, go to:\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/anthrax-bird-flu-dangers-lax-security-disease-control-labs.\n\nThe NY Times article notes 400 high-level containment laboratories in 2004 but some 1400 today.

Many of the accidents involved leaks, spills or other releases of infectious material inside the laboratories, potentially infecting workers and often requiring extensive decontamination.\n\nAnother report, by the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, provided a rare glimpse into the types of accidents that have occurred at high-level labs around the country, often at universities.\n\nLab workers at different sites accidentally jabbed themselves with needles contaminated by anthrax or West Nile virus. An air-cleaning system meant to filter dangerous microbes out of a lab failed, but no one knew because the alarms had been turned off. A batch of West Nile virus, improperly packed in dry ice, burst open at a Federal Express shipping center. Mice infected with bubonic plague or Q fever went missing. And workers exposed to Q fever, brucellosis or tuberculosis did not realize it until they either became ill or blood tests detected the exposure.\n\nThe good news is that relatively few lab workers have become ill from accidental exposures: only 11 from 2004 to 2010, according to the CDC report. None died, and none infected other people.\n\nRichard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist and laboratory director from Rutgers University, said he had \"no confidence\" in the safety of the many labs that have sprung up since 2001. He suggested there was a culture of complacency at some of them, as well as hubris among some researchers who believe they do not need oversight or management.\n\nThe most recent revelations have underscored potentially serious lapses at the government's premier institutions. In June 2014, dozens of CDC employees may have been exposed to live anthrax. In another case disclosed this month [July 2014], a CDC lab accidentally contaminated a relatively benign flu sample with a dangerous H5N1 bird flu strain that has killed 386 people since 2003 and then shipped it to a lab at the Department of Agriculture. In yet another episode this month [July 2014], vials of smallpox and other infectious agents were discovered in a government laboratory on the campus of the National Institutes of Health after being stored and apparently forgotten about 50 years ago.\n\n6 or 7 government agencies were involved in the growth spurt of labs across the country focusing on dangerous pathogens, with no overall strategic plan, according to Nancy Kingsbury, the managing director of applied research and methods at the GAO, who testified last week before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.\n\nFor years, the accountability office has warned that there was no one federal agency overseeing all the laboratories. In fact, it has said, the real number of high-level labs is not even known because the only ones required to register with the government are those handling \"select agents,\" microbes that can cause serious illness in people, animals or crops. Other high-level labs handle pathogens that may be dangerous but are not listed as select agents, the office said, adding that not much is known about them.\n\n[Readers are encouraged to read the complete article on the NY Times website. - Mod.MHJ]\n\n[Byline: Denise Grady]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a parallel viewpoint from the UK, go to:\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/anthrax-bird-flu-dangers-lax-security-disease-control-labs.\n\nThe NY Times article notes 400 high-level containment laboratories in 2004 but some 1400 today.

The season: JE has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes -- Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains the outbreak stops.\n\n(2). The clinical illness: The clinical and laboratory parameters are not like encephalitis (ICD 10 A 86), but typical of encephalopathy. Onset is sudden, without any prodromal phase, typically in the early morning hours. Till previous evening the child [has been] well. Cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] is clear with no increase in cell count. Low CSF sugar and low blood sugar are documented in some 40 per cent of children. Thus, the diagnosis is acute encephalopathy (ICD 10 G 92 and 93). The cause is non-infectious.\n\nThe reason, I believe, why earlier investigators (and there were several teams of experts, including from CDC, who had investigated this problem over a few or even many years) missed this clear distinction was that Japanese encephalitis occurs typically in recurrent seasonal outbreaks, and any acute brain disease occurring in annual seasonal outbreaks are taken for granted as some encephalitis. Once you diagnose encephalitis, the direction of investigation is to take clinical samples and look for viruses.\n\nThose who have not kept up with the literature over the decades may not be aware of the many reports of outbreaks of acute encephalopathy in India (Jamshedpur fever; Nagpur encephalopathy; Reye syndrome outbreak, hepatomyoencephalopathy) and in Thailand (Udorn encephalopathy). So, acute encephalopathy can occur in outbreaks; when outbreaks occur in annual seasonal recurrent fashion, there has to be some factor(s) with repetitive behavior, triggering or actually causing the disease in clusters. Epidemiological puritans can argue if non-infectious encephalopathy outbreaks are truly outbreaks or merely clusters.\n\n(3). Muzaffarpur is famous for lychee [litchi] orchards. May and June are lychee harvest season. The strong spatial and temporal association of the outbreaks with lychee harvesting have been noticed by all previous investigators, but they did not pursue the association in depth. Similar lychee-harvest-associated acute encephalopathy outbreaks have been recently reported in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh the diagnosis was encephalopathy -- hence pesticides were considered the noxious agent. In Viet Nam, lychee-associated viruses were explored. Even in Muzaffarpur, fruit-eating bats have been noted, and some investigators proposed some bat viruses.\n\nMalda in West Bengal is another lychee cultivating region in India, and this year [2014], a similar outbreak has been reported in the media (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Litchi-virus-kills-8-kids-in-Malda/articleshow/36225598.cms).\n\n(4). The Jamaican vomiting disease (acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy) is triggered by eating unripe ackee fruit [_Blighia sapida_], which contains a toxin called hypoglycin A (Methylenecyclopropylalanine, MCPA). Ackee and lychee belong to one family, namely soapberry (_Sapindaceae_). Lychee seeds have been shown to have a lower analogue of MCPA, namely methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG). In animal experiments, both MCPA and MCPG interfere with fatty acid oxidation, in mitochondria, thus causing acute encephalopathy like in Jamaican vomiting disease.\n\nWe all know lychee is a safe and enjoyably edible fruit, very popular. Eating lychee cannot simply be blamed for the Muzaffarpur (or the Bangladesh and Viet Nam) outbreaks. Yet, the presence of MCPG in lychee seeds must be pursued -- my investigation this year [2014] was aimed at investigating cases for \"metabolic fatty acid derangement\" and lychee seeds and fruits for MCPG or associated substances. Unfortunately, I was given some colleagues who interfered with funding for the studies, and thus I lost the opportunity to complete the investigations this season. Just 4 days ago, I received word that funding may be back on track, but that is too late for this year.\n\nThe pathogenesis appears to be blocked gluconeogenesis -- why children go into gluconeogenesis has to be investigated -- most victims are undernourished, and probably liver glycogen-depleted. So perhaps their glycogenolysis is inadequate to supply brain cells with energy source, namely glucose. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is necessary, but some toxin blocks the pathway -- like in any fatty acid metabolic derangement syndrome (usually of genetic origin). These are all hypothetical, to explain what we have observed. Organic acidemia and aciduria would have confirmed the diagnosis, but this year I did not have funds to pursue this.\n\nIn summary, the Muzaffarpur (and Malda in India, Bangladesh and Viet Nam) seasonal brain disease outbreaks in children are a peculiar acute encephalopathy, non-infectious in origin, probably predisposed by undernutrition and somehow associated with either lychee seed swallowing, or some such unknown link, to be investigated next year. Please be sure I am not giving lychee a bad name; please eat lychee to your hearts' content, for lychee is a great and safe fruit.\n\nI am attaching a recent hypothesis note published in: John TJ, Das M. Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: hypothesis of toxic origin. Current Science, 2014; 106: 1184-1185 (10 May 2014).\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n******\n[2] Litchi fruit NOT\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2014\nSource: The Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/no-link-between-litchi-aes-say-experts/\n\n\nExperts looking into the annual outbreak of a disease in parts of Gorakhpur [district] in Uttar Pradesh [state] and Muzaffarpur [district] in Bihar [state], which has claimed the lives of many children, have told The Indian Express that it has nothing to do with the cultivation of litchi [lychee]. The disease, for the 1st time, has also led to the deaths of children in Malda district of West Bengal [state] this year [2014].\n\nIn the absence of any known pathogen or infectious agent, the symptoms are described as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Since those affected reside close to litchi plantations, it has been loosely described as \"litchi syndrome\" as well. Some experts feel that the children are affected by colouring agents and insecticides used on the fruit crop. However, no connection has been established.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal's minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, said on Wednesday that children should not eat green litchi. \"It contains toxins, which reduces the blood sugar level as well as glucose in the body, leading to the infection, particularly in children,\" she was quoted as saying in the Assembly.\n\nDr Vishal Nath, the director of Muzaffarpur-based National Centre for Litchi under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), said, \"We have been working on investigating a correlation between litchi and the AES cases for years, and have performed hundreds of toxicology studies. Last year [2013], we had a team of experts from the Centre for Disease Control in the US, and the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi. Even this year [2014] we have doctors from the field conducting tests everyday...we have established zero association between the 2. It is ridiculous to still call the disease a litchi syndrome or associate it with the fruit in any way.\"\n\nNath pointed out that while the crop begins to bear fruit in the 1st week of May, the AES cases start surfacing a month later in June, when 90 per cent of the crop has been \"picked, sold and disposed of.\"\n\n\"Our research teams have also busted the theory that children who contract the disease may have eaten the fruit [that had] fallen from trees, which may have been touched by rats or bats. Zoologists and toxicologists from multiple agencies have conducted tests and found no toxins in the bodies of diagnosed children or on fruit samples,\" Nath explained.\n\nExperts say a history of a similar AES outbreak in Siliguri [West Bengal state] in 1996, which was traced to imported raspberry, might be behind this litchi theory.\n\nExperts at the ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, who have been trying to identify a cause for the outbreaks in Muzaffarpur, said no known cause of the disease was identified yet. \"We do not know if there is a pathogen or any environmental factors or infectious agents behind the disease. AES is a term for a broad spectrum of diseases which have encephalitis-like syndrome, including fever convulsions and high mortality, but we do not know what the disease is exactly,\" Dr Pradip Das, director of RMRI, said.\n\nIn-charge of National Centre for Disease Control, Patna, Dr Ram Singh, said tests performed by their scientists and CDC in the US last year [2013] had \"shown no association with litchi, or helped us identify any cause of the disease.\"\n\nGorakhpur witnesses JE [Japanese encephalitis virus infections] and AES cases associated with water-borne factors every year. Due to similarities in symptoms, children in Muzaffarpur were 1st tested for JE. Dr G K Thakur, medical superintendent of the Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur, one of the 2 hospitals where children are treated, said all diagnosed cases have tested negative for JE. \"If you take the history of the patients, not all have eaten the fruit. Children less than a year old cannot walk around and eat fruits lying around trees. We treat children with anti-convulsant and fever-controlling drugs,\" Thakur said.\n\nDoctors of SKMC [Sri Krishna Medical College] published an article in July [2013] in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Public Health saying that high temperatures and humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which may be contributing to the AES-like symptoms.\n\nThe experts' views came a day after Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called an emergency meeting Tuesday [10 Jun 2014] on AES. The ministry announced a JE immunisation campaign on 22-23 Jun [2014] in UP [Uttar Pradesh] and Bihar [states] as a precautionary measure. Harsh Vardhan said there was a need to conduct more research on the still unexplained nature of the disease and set up a National Virology Centre in Muzaffarpur.\n\n[byline: Pritha Chatterjee]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Litchi has been associated with cases of AES for several years. The above 2 reports lay this hypothesis to rest. Similarly, these cases of encephalopathy apparently have nothing to do with JE virus infection, which, although occurring in the same localities, has a different seasonal pattern.

The season: JE has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes -- Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains the outbreak stops.\n\n(2). The clinical illness: The clinical and laboratory parameters are not like encephalitis (ICD 10 A 86), but typical of encephalopathy. Onset is sudden, without any prodromal phase, typically in the early morning hours. Till previous evening the child [has been] well. Cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] is clear with no increase in cell count. Low CSF sugar and low blood sugar are documented in some 40 per cent of children. Thus, the diagnosis is acute encephalopathy (ICD 10 G 92 and 93). The cause is non-infectious.\n\nThe reason, I believe, why earlier investigators (and there were several teams of experts, including from CDC, who had investigated this problem over a few or even many years) missed this clear distinction was that Japanese encephalitis occurs typically in recurrent seasonal outbreaks, and any acute brain disease occurring in annual seasonal outbreaks are taken for granted as some encephalitis. Once you diagnose encephalitis, the direction of investigation is to take clinical samples and look for viruses.\n\nThose who have not kept up with the literature over the decades may not be aware of the many reports of outbreaks of acute encephalopathy in India (Jamshedpur fever; Nagpur encephalopathy; Reye syndrome outbreak, hepatomyoencephalopathy) and in Thailand (Udorn encephalopathy). So, acute encephalopathy can occur in outbreaks; when outbreaks occur in annual seasonal recurrent fashion, there has to be some factor(s) with repetitive behavior, triggering or actually causing the disease in clusters. Epidemiological puritans can argue if non-infectious encephalopathy outbreaks are truly outbreaks or merely clusters.\n\n(3). Muzaffarpur is famous for lychee [litchi] orchards. May and June are lychee harvest season. The strong spatial and temporal association of the outbreaks with lychee harvesting have been noticed by all previous investigators, but they did not pursue the association in depth. Similar lychee-harvest-associated acute encephalopathy outbreaks have been recently reported in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh the diagnosis was encephalopathy -- hence pesticides were considered the noxious agent. In Viet Nam, lychee-associated viruses were explored. Even in Muzaffarpur, fruit-eating bats have been noted, and some investigators proposed some bat viruses.\n\nMalda in West Bengal is another lychee cultivating region in India, and this year [2014], a similar outbreak has been reported in the media (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Litchi-virus-kills-8-kids-in-Malda/articleshow/36225598.cms).\n\n(4). The Jamaican vomiting disease (acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy) is triggered by eating unripe ackee fruit [_Blighia sapida_], which contains a toxin called hypoglycin A (Methylenecyclopropylalanine, MCPA). Ackee and lychee belong to one family, namely soapberry (_Sapindaceae_). Lychee seeds have been shown to have a lower analogue of MCPA, namely methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG). In animal experiments, both MCPA and MCPG interfere with fatty acid oxidation, in mitochondria, thus causing acute encephalopathy like in Jamaican vomiting disease.\n\nWe all know lychee is a safe and enjoyably edible fruit, very popular. Eating lychee cannot simply be blamed for the Muzaffarpur (or the Bangladesh and Viet Nam) outbreaks. Yet, the presence of MCPG in lychee seeds must be pursued -- my investigation this year [2014] was aimed at investigating cases for \"metabolic fatty acid derangement\" and lychee seeds and fruits for MCPG or associated substances. Unfortunately, I was given some colleagues who interfered with funding for the studies, and thus I lost the opportunity to complete the investigations this season. Just 4 days ago, I received word that funding may be back on track, but that is too late for this year.\n\nThe pathogenesis appears to be blocked gluconeogenesis -- why children go into gluconeogenesis has to be investigated -- most victims are undernourished, and probably liver glycogen-depleted. So perhaps their glycogenolysis is inadequate to supply brain cells with energy source, namely glucose. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is necessary, but some toxin blocks the pathway -- like in any fatty acid metabolic derangement syndrome (usually of genetic origin). These are all hypothetical, to explain what we have observed. Organic acidemia and aciduria would have confirmed the diagnosis, but this year I did not have funds to pursue this.\n\nIn summary, the Muzaffarpur (and Malda in India, Bangladesh and Viet Nam) seasonal brain disease outbreaks in children are a peculiar acute encephalopathy, non-infectious in origin, probably predisposed by undernutrition and somehow associated with either lychee seed swallowing, or some such unknown link, to be investigated next year. Please be sure I am not giving lychee a bad name; please eat lychee to your hearts' content, for lychee is a great and safe fruit.\n\nI am attaching a recent hypothesis note published in: John TJ, Das M. Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: hypothesis of toxic origin. Current Science, 2014; 106: 1184-1185 (10 May 2014).\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n******\n[2] Litchi fruit NOT\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2014\nSource: The Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/no-link-between-litchi-aes-say-experts/\n\n\nExperts looking into the annual outbreak of a disease in parts of Gorakhpur [district] in Uttar Pradesh [state] and Muzaffarpur [district] in Bihar [state], which has claimed the lives of many children, have told The Indian Express that it has nothing to do with the cultivation of litchi [lychee]. The disease, for the 1st time, has also led to the deaths of children in Malda district of West Bengal [state] this year [2014].\n\nIn the absence of any known pathogen or infectious agent, the symptoms are described as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Since those affected reside close to litchi plantations, it has been loosely described as \"litchi syndrome\" as well. Some experts feel that the children are affected by colouring agents and insecticides used on the fruit crop. However, no connection has been established.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal's minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, said on Wednesday that children should not eat green litchi. \"It contains toxins, which reduces the blood sugar level as well as glucose in the body, leading to the infection, particularly in children,\" she was quoted as saying in the Assembly.\n\nDr Vishal Nath, the director of Muzaffarpur-based National Centre for Litchi under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), said, \"We have been working on investigating a correlation between litchi and the AES cases for years, and have performed hundreds of toxicology studies. Last year [2013], we had a team of experts from the Centre for Disease Control in the US, and the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi. Even this year [2014] we have doctors from the field conducting tests everyday...we have established zero association between the 2. It is ridiculous to still call the disease a litchi syndrome or associate it with the fruit in any way.\"\n\nNath pointed out that while the crop begins to bear fruit in the 1st week of May, the AES cases start surfacing a month later in June, when 90 per cent of the crop has been \"picked, sold and disposed of.\"\n\n\"Our research teams have also busted the theory that children who contract the disease may have eaten the fruit [that had] fallen from trees, which may have been touched by rats or bats. Zoologists and toxicologists from multiple agencies have conducted tests and found no toxins in the bodies of diagnosed children or on fruit samples,\" Nath explained.\n\nExperts say a history of a similar AES outbreak in Siliguri [West Bengal state] in 1996, which was traced to imported raspberry, might be behind this litchi theory.\n\nExperts at the ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, who have been trying to identify a cause for the outbreaks in Muzaffarpur, said no known cause of the disease was identified yet. \"We do not know if there is a pathogen or any environmental factors or infectious agents behind the disease. AES is a term for a broad spectrum of diseases which have encephalitis-like syndrome, including fever convulsions and high mortality, but we do not know what the disease is exactly,\" Dr Pradip Das, director of RMRI, said.\n\nIn-charge of National Centre for Disease Control, Patna, Dr Ram Singh, said tests performed by their scientists and CDC in the US last year [2013] had \"shown no association with litchi, or helped us identify any cause of the disease.\"\n\nGorakhpur witnesses JE [Japanese encephalitis virus infections] and AES cases associated with water-borne factors every year. Due to similarities in symptoms, children in Muzaffarpur were 1st tested for JE. Dr G K Thakur, medical superintendent of the Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur, one of the 2 hospitals where children are treated, said all diagnosed cases have tested negative for JE. \"If you take the history of the patients, not all have eaten the fruit.

The season: JE has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes -- Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains the outbreak stops.\n\n(2). The clinical illness: The clinical and laboratory parameters are not like encephalitis (ICD 10 A 86), but typical of encephalopathy. Onset is sudden, without any prodromal phase, typically in the early morning hours. Till previous evening the child [has been] well. Cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] is clear with no increase in cell count. Low CSF sugar and low blood sugar are documented in some 40 per cent of children. Thus, the diagnosis is acute encephalopathy (ICD 10 G 92 and 93). The cause is non-infectious.\n\nThe reason, I believe, why earlier investigators (and there were several teams of experts, including from CDC, who had investigated this problem over a few or even many years) missed this clear distinction was that Japanese encephalitis occurs typically in recurrent seasonal outbreaks, and any acute brain disease occurring in annual seasonal outbreaks are taken for granted as some encephalitis. Once you diagnose encephalitis, the direction of investigation is to take clinical samples and look for viruses.\n\nThose who have not kept up with the literature over the decades may not be aware of the many reports of outbreaks of acute encephalopathy in India (Jamshedpur fever; Nagpur encephalopathy; Reye syndrome outbreak, hepatomyoencephalopathy) and in Thailand (Udorn encephalopathy). So, acute encephalopathy can occur in outbreaks; when outbreaks occur in annual seasonal recurrent fashion, there has to be some factor(s) with repetitive behavior, triggering or actually causing the disease in clusters. Epidemiological puritans can argue if non-infectious encephalopathy outbreaks are truly outbreaks or merely clusters.\n\n(3). Muzaffarpur is famous for lychee [litchi] orchards. May and June are lychee harvest season. The strong spatial and temporal association of the outbreaks with lychee harvesting have been noticed by all previous investigators, but they did not pursue the association in depth. Similar lychee-harvest-associated acute encephalopathy outbreaks have been recently reported in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh the diagnosis was encephalopathy -- hence pesticides were considered the noxious agent. In Viet Nam, lychee-associated viruses were explored. Even in Muzaffarpur, fruit-eating bats have been noted, and some investigators proposed some bat viruses.\n\nMalda in West Bengal is another lychee cultivating region in India, and this year [2014], a similar outbreak has been reported in the media (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Litchi-virus-kills-8-kids-in-Malda/articleshow/36225598.cms).\n\n(4). The Jamaican vomiting disease (acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy) is triggered by eating unripe ackee fruit [_Blighia sapida_], which contains a toxin called hypoglycin A (Methylenecyclopropylalanine, MCPA). Ackee and lychee belong to one family, namely soapberry (_Sapindaceae_). Lychee seeds have been shown to have a lower analogue of MCPA, namely methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG). In animal experiments, both MCPA and MCPG interfere with fatty acid oxidation, in mitochondria, thus causing acute encephalopathy like in Jamaican vomiting disease.\n\nWe all know lychee is a safe and enjoyably edible fruit, very popular. Eating lychee cannot simply be blamed for the Muzaffarpur (or the Bangladesh and Viet Nam) outbreaks. Yet, the presence of MCPG in lychee seeds must be pursued -- my investigation this year [2014] was aimed at investigating cases for \"metabolic fatty acid derangement\" and lychee seeds and fruits for MCPG or associated substances. Unfortunately, I was given some colleagues who interfered with funding for the studies, and thus I lost the opportunity to complete the investigations this season. Just 4 days ago, I received word that funding may be back on track, but that is too late for this year.\n\nThe pathogenesis appears to be blocked gluconeogenesis -- why children go into gluconeogenesis has to be investigated -- most victims are undernourished, and probably liver glycogen-depleted. So perhaps their glycogenolysis is inadequate to supply brain cells with energy source, namely glucose. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is necessary, but some toxin blocks the pathway -- like in any fatty acid metabolic derangement syndrome (usually of genetic origin). These are all hypothetical, to explain what we have observed. Organic acidemia and aciduria would have confirmed the diagnosis, but this year I did not have funds to pursue this.\n\nIn summary, the Muzaffarpur (and Malda in India, Bangladesh and Viet Nam) seasonal brain disease outbreaks in children are a peculiar acute encephalopathy, non-infectious in origin, probably predisposed by undernutrition and somehow associated with either lychee seed swallowing, or some such unknown link, to be investigated next year. Please be sure I am not giving lychee a bad name; please eat lychee to your hearts' content, for lychee is a great and safe fruit.\n\nI am attaching a recent hypothesis note published in: John TJ, Das M. Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: hypothesis of toxic origin. Current Science, 2014; 106: 1184-1185 (10 May 2014).\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n******\n[2] Litchi fruit NOT\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2014\nSource: The Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/no-link-between-litchi-aes-say-experts/\n\n\nExperts looking into the annual outbreak of a disease in parts of Gorakhpur [district] in Uttar Pradesh [state] and Muzaffarpur [district] in Bihar [state], which has claimed the lives of many children, have told The Indian Express that it has nothing to do with the cultivation of litchi [lychee]. The disease, for the 1st time, has also led to the deaths of children in Malda district of West Bengal [state] this year [2014].\n\nIn the absence of any known pathogen or infectious agent, the symptoms are described as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Since those affected reside close to litchi plantations, it has been loosely described as \"litchi syndrome\" as well. Some experts feel that the children are affected by colouring agents and insecticides used on the fruit crop. However, no connection has been established.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal's minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, said on Wednesday that children should not eat green litchi. \"It contains toxins, which reduces the blood sugar level as well as glucose in the body, leading to the infection, particularly in children,\" she was quoted as saying in the Assembly.\n\nDr Vishal Nath, the director of Muzaffarpur-based National Centre for Litchi under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), said, \"We have been working on investigating a correlation between litchi and the AES cases for years, and have performed hundreds of toxicology studies. Last year [2013], we had a team of experts from the Centre for Disease Control in the US, and the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi. Even this year [2014] we have doctors from the field conducting tests everyday...we have established zero association between the 2. It is ridiculous to still call the disease a litchi syndrome or associate it with the fruit in any way.\"\n\nNath pointed out that while the crop begins to bear fruit in the 1st week of May, the AES cases start surfacing a month later in June, when 90 per cent of the crop has been \"picked, sold and disposed of.\"\n\n\"Our research teams have also busted the theory that children who contract the disease may have eaten the fruit [that had] fallen from trees, which may have been touched by rats or bats. Zoologists and toxicologists from multiple agencies have conducted tests and found no toxins in the bodies of diagnosed children or on fruit samples,\" Nath explained.\n\nExperts say a history of a similar AES outbreak in Siliguri [West Bengal state] in 1996, which was traced to imported raspberry, might be behind this litchi theory.\n\nExperts at the ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, who have been trying to identify a cause for the outbreaks in Muzaffarpur, said no known cause of the disease was identified yet. \"We do not know if there is a pathogen or any environmental factors or infectious agents behind the disease. AES is a term for a broad spectrum of diseases which have encephalitis-like syndrome, including fever convulsions and high mortality, but we do not know what the disease is exactly,\" Dr Pradip Das, director of RMRI, said.\n\nIn-charge of National Centre for Disease Control, Patna, Dr Ram Singh, said tests performed by their scientists and CDC in the US last year [2013] had \"shown no association with litchi, or helped us identify any cause of the disease.\"\n\nGorakhpur witnesses JE [Japanese encephalitis virus infections] and AES cases associated with water-borne factors every year. Due to similarities in symptoms, children in Muzaffarpur were 1st tested for JE. Dr G K Thakur, medical superintendent of the Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur, one of the 2 hospitals where children are treated, said all diagnosed cases have tested negative for JE. \"If you take the history of the patients, not all have eaten the fruit. Children less than a year old cannot walk around and eat fruits lying around trees. We treat children with anti-convulsant and fever-controlling drugs,\" Thakur said.\n\nDoctors of SKMC [Sri Krishna Medical College] published an article in July [2013] in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Public Health saying that high temperatures and humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which may be contributing to the AES-like symptoms.\n\nThe experts' views came a day after Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called an emergency meeting Tuesday [10 Jun 2014] on AES. The ministry announced a JE immunisation campaign on 22-23 Jun [2014] in UP [Uttar Pradesh] and Bihar [states] as a precautionary measure. Harsh Vardhan said there was a need to conduct more research on the still unexplained nature of the disease and set up a National Virology Centre in Muzaffarpur.\n\n[byline: Pritha Chatterjee]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Litchi has been associated with cases of AES for several years.

The season: JE has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes -- Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains the outbreak stops.\n\n(2). The clinical illness: The clinical and laboratory parameters are not like encephalitis (ICD 10 A 86), but typical of encephalopathy. Onset is sudden, without any prodromal phase, typically in the early morning hours. Till previous evening the child [has been] well. Cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] is clear with no increase in cell count. Low CSF sugar and low blood sugar are documented in some 40 per cent of children. Thus, the diagnosis is acute encephalopathy (ICD 10 G 92 and 93). The cause is non-infectious.\n\nThe reason, I believe, why earlier investigators (and there were several teams of experts, including from CDC, who had investigated this problem over a few or even many years) missed this clear distinction was that Japanese encephalitis occurs typically in recurrent seasonal outbreaks, and any acute brain disease occurring in annual seasonal outbreaks are taken for granted as some encephalitis. Once you diagnose encephalitis, the direction of investigation is to take clinical samples and look for viruses.\n\nThose who have not kept up with the literature over the decades may not be aware of the many reports of outbreaks of acute encephalopathy in India (Jamshedpur fever; Nagpur encephalopathy; Reye syndrome outbreak, hepatomyoencephalopathy) and in Thailand (Udorn encephalopathy). So, acute encephalopathy can occur in outbreaks; when outbreaks occur in annual seasonal recurrent fashion, there has to be some factor(s) with repetitive behavior, triggering or actually causing the disease in clusters. Epidemiological puritans can argue if non-infectious encephalopathy outbreaks are truly outbreaks or merely clusters.\n\n(3). Muzaffarpur is famous for lychee [litchi] orchards. May and June are lychee harvest season. The strong spatial and temporal association of the outbreaks with lychee harvesting have been noticed by all previous investigators, but they did not pursue the association in depth. Similar lychee-harvest-associated acute encephalopathy outbreaks have been recently reported in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh the diagnosis was encephalopathy -- hence pesticides were considered the noxious agent. In Viet Nam, lychee-associated viruses were explored. Even in Muzaffarpur, fruit-eating bats have been noted, and some investigators proposed some bat viruses.\n\nMalda in West Bengal is another lychee cultivating region in India, and this year [2014], a similar outbreak has been reported in the media (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Litchi-virus-kills-8-kids-in-Malda/articleshow/36225598.cms).\n\n(4). The Jamaican vomiting disease (acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy) is triggered by eating unripe ackee fruit [_Blighia sapida_], which contains a toxin called hypoglycin A (Methylenecyclopropylalanine, MCPA). Ackee and lychee belong to one family, namely soapberry (_Sapindaceae_). Lychee seeds have been shown to have a lower analogue of MCPA, namely methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG). In animal experiments, both MCPA and MCPG interfere with fatty acid oxidation, in mitochondria, thus causing acute encephalopathy like in Jamaican vomiting disease.\n\nWe all know lychee is a safe and enjoyably edible fruit, very popular. Eating lychee cannot simply be blamed for the Muzaffarpur (or the Bangladesh and Viet Nam) outbreaks. Yet, the presence of MCPG in lychee seeds must be pursued -- my investigation this year [2014] was aimed at investigating cases for \"metabolic fatty acid derangement\" and lychee seeds and fruits for MCPG or associated substances. Unfortunately, I was given some colleagues who interfered with funding for the studies, and thus I lost the opportunity to complete the investigations this season. Just 4 days ago, I received word that funding may be back on track, but that is too late for this year.\n\nThe pathogenesis appears to be blocked gluconeogenesis -- why children go into gluconeogenesis has to be investigated -- most victims are undernourished, and probably liver glycogen-depleted. So perhaps their glycogenolysis is inadequate to supply brain cells with energy source, namely glucose. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is necessary, but some toxin blocks the pathway -- like in any fatty acid metabolic derangement syndrome (usually of genetic origin). These are all hypothetical, to explain what we have observed. Organic acidemia and aciduria would have confirmed the diagnosis, but this year I did not have funds to pursue this.\n\nIn summary, the Muzaffarpur (and Malda in India, Bangladesh and Viet Nam) seasonal brain disease outbreaks in children are a peculiar acute encephalopathy, non-infectious in origin, probably predisposed by undernutrition and somehow associated with either lychee seed swallowing, or some such unknown link, to be investigated next year. Please be sure I am not giving lychee a bad name; please eat lychee to your hearts' content, for lychee is a great and safe fruit.\n\nI am attaching a recent hypothesis note published in: John TJ, Das M. Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: hypothesis of toxic origin. Current Science, 2014; 106: 1184-1185 (10 May 2014).\n\n--\nT Jacob John\n<tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in>\n\n******\n[2] Litchi fruit NOT\nDate: Thu 12 Jun 2014\nSource: The Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/no-link-between-litchi-aes-say-experts/\n\n\nExperts looking into the annual outbreak of a disease in parts of Gorakhpur [district] in Uttar Pradesh [state] and Muzaffarpur [district] in Bihar [state], which has claimed the lives of many children, have told The Indian Express that it has nothing to do with the cultivation of litchi [lychee]. The disease, for the 1st time, has also led to the deaths of children in Malda district of West Bengal [state] this year [2014].\n\nIn the absence of any known pathogen or infectious agent, the symptoms are described as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Since those affected reside close to litchi plantations, it has been loosely described as \"litchi syndrome\" as well. Some experts feel that the children are affected by colouring agents and insecticides used on the fruit crop. However, no connection has been established.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal's minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, said on Wednesday that children should not eat green litchi. \"It contains toxins, which reduces the blood sugar level as well as glucose in the body, leading to the infection, particularly in children,\" she was quoted as saying in the Assembly.\n\nDr Vishal Nath, the director of Muzaffarpur-based National Centre for Litchi under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), said, \"We have been working on investigating a correlation between litchi and the AES cases for years, and have performed hundreds of toxicology studies. Last year [2013], we had a team of experts from the Centre for Disease Control in the US, and the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi. Even this year [2014] we have doctors from the field conducting tests everyday...we have established zero association between the 2. It is ridiculous to still call the disease a litchi syndrome or associate it with the fruit in any way.\"\n\nNath pointed out that while the crop begins to bear fruit in the 1st week of May, the AES cases start surfacing a month later in June, when 90 per cent of the crop has been \"picked, sold and disposed of.\"\n\n\"Our research teams have also busted the theory that children who contract the disease may have eaten the fruit [that had] fallen from trees, which may have been touched by rats or bats. Zoologists and toxicologists from multiple agencies have conducted tests and found no toxins in the bodies of diagnosed children or on fruit samples,\" Nath explained.\n\nExperts say a history of a similar AES outbreak in Siliguri [West Bengal state] in 1996, which was traced to imported raspberry, might be behind this litchi theory.\n\nExperts at the ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, who have been trying to identify a cause for the outbreaks in Muzaffarpur, said no known cause of the disease was identified yet. \"We do not know if there is a pathogen or any environmental factors or infectious agents behind the disease. AES is a term for a broad spectrum of diseases which have encephalitis-like syndrome, including fever convulsions and high mortality, but we do not know what the disease is exactly,\" Dr Pradip Das, director of RMRI, said.\n\nIn-charge of National Centre for Disease Control, Patna, Dr Ram Singh, said tests performed by their scientists and CDC in the US last year [2013] had \"shown no association with litchi, or helped us identify any cause of the disease.\"\n\nGorakhpur witnesses JE [Japanese encephalitis virus infections] and AES cases associated with water-borne factors every year. Due to similarities in symptoms, children in Muzaffarpur were 1st tested for JE. Dr G K Thakur, medical superintendent of the Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur, one of the 2 hospitals where children are treated, said all diagnosed cases have tested negative for JE. \"If you take the history of the patients, not all have eaten the fruit. Children less than a year old cannot walk around and eat fruits lying around trees. We treat children with anti-convulsant and fever-controlling drugs,\" Thakur said.\n\nDoctors of SKMC [Sri Krishna Medical College] published an article in July [2013] in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Public Health saying that high temperatures and humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which may be contributing to the AES-like symptoms.\n\nThe experts' views came a day after Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called an emergency meeting Tuesday [10 Jun 2014] on AES. The ministry announced a JE immunisation campaign on 22-23 Jun [2014] in UP [Uttar Pradesh] and Bihar [states] as a precautionary measure. Harsh Vardhan said there was a need to conduct more research on the still unexplained nature of the disease and set up a National Virology Centre in Muzaffarpur.\n\n[byline: Pritha Chatterjee]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Litchi has been associated with cases of AES for several years.

The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas and children are the worst affected.\n\nMore than 200 patients are still being treated at government hospitals.\n\nAt least 6500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the 1st case was detected in 1978.\n\nGorakhpur and adjoining districts, which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas, are low-lying and prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus.\n\nUntil 2005, doctors say that the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus. But in the past 7 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.\n\nThe diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney.\n\nDoctors say children between the age of 6 months and 15 years are the worst affected. A 5th of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.\n\nThe government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of encephalitis in the region. Last week [week of 1 Oct 2013], India launched a vaccine [campaign] against Japanese encephalitis as part of a national programme to fight the virus.\n\n\"Beginning with the 1st report in 1955 in Tamil Nadu state, the Japanese encephalitis virus has now spread to more than 171 districts in 19 states,\" Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the launch of the vaccine. In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur killed 1000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since 1978.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As with previous reports of viral encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state, there is no indication of the proportion of these cases due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections or to other, undetermined causes. In previous reports, some have been diagnosed as due to Japanese encephalitis infections and other associated with contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus infections. The massive Japanese encephalitis virus vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Behar states has resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus.\n\nThe cause of the majority of the AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) cases remains undiagnosed, and one hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to find out what is going on, so that scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented. Although JEV outbreaks may continue to be prevented through vaccination, preventing enterovirus infections, in the absence of vaccines, requires improvement of sanitation infrastructure to assure adequate human waste disposal and uncontaminated potable water supplies, a very costly effort.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of India showing the location of Uttar Pradesh state can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1-k3. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP) 20130929.1973911\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP) 20130923.1963818\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (15): (KL) 20130827.1904591\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (14): (UP) 20130825.1900553\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (13) 20130821.1892929\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (UP) 20130731.1856438\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (11): (AS) 20130723.1839559\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (10): (BR) 20130714.1824758\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR) 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................sb/lm/ty/mj/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "1978-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1955-03-15 00:00:00", "2005-03-15 00:00:00", "1978-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Tamil Nadu", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Nepal", "country": "Nepal"}, {"location": "Gorakhpur", "country": "India"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1973911", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (17): (UP)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1973911", "date": "2013-07-14 21:13:44", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (10): (BEHAR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 13 Jul 2013\nSource: New York Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/world/africa/as-mystery-illness-stalks-its-young-india-intensifies-search-for-a-killer.html?google_editors_picks=true&_r=0\n\n\nThe children begin arriving every year in mid-May, brought to an overburdened hospital here in one of India's most impoverished areas by their panic-stricken mothers. Seemingly healthy hours earlier, most have lapsed into a coma punctuated by convulsions.\n\nDoctors work to calm the convulsions and keep the children hydrated, but then have to watch helplessly along with the anguished parents as a 3rd of their young patients die, often within hours. Then, as suddenly as it started, the mysterious outbreak stops with the onset of the monsoon rains this month [July 2013]. No one knows why.\n\nThe mud-and-bamboo huts in this part of India cradle more dying children than anywhere in the world, with diarrhea and malnutrition long ranking as the region's great scourges. But now, this unknown killer is stalking the very young.\n\nAlthough public health statistics are unreliable here, the disease is believed to infect tens of thousands of people a year and kill thousands.\n\nAll doctors know is that the illness is a form of brain swelling, or encephalitis, but that is a huge category, covering a wide spectrum of diseases. Doctors have tested for known causes of brain swelling, including meningitis and Japanese encephalitis, but the tests almost always come back negative. India's top health officials say the disease, known officially as acute encephalitis syndrome, has them stumped.\n\n\"This outbreak happens every year, and we have not been able to identify the cause or link even a single factor responsible,\" Dr. L. S. Chauhan, the director of the National Center for Disease Control in India, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Chauhan hopes to change that. With help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, he started a program this year [2013] to train an elite cadre of disease sleuths, part of a recently organized Epidemic Intelligence Service in India, that he hopes will eventually undertake the investigations of India's estimated 1500 epidemics.\n\nBut the outbreak in Muzaffarpur is slowly spreading to neighboring areas, and Dr. Chauhan has thrown everything he can at it, assigning all 7 of his trainees, each already an accomplished physician. Experts from the C.D.C. are advising them, and their work is being closely followed by concerned officials in the United States.\n\nThe 1st reports of this mysterious illness date to 1995, when nearly 1000 children were sickened and 300 died in Muzaffarpur's 3 hospitals. Smaller epidemics have followed almost every year since.\n\nOfficials say they do not know whether the illness began in 1995 or had simply gone unnoticed before. Not only has it spread to nearby areas, but researchers have also recently found similar cases in neighboring Nepal. Some outbreaks in India have gone unreported because officials suppressed any mention for fear of prompting panic or criticism.\n\n\"India has a huge problem with encephalitis,\" said Dr. Rajesh Pandey, one of the epidemiologists camped out in Muzaffarpur, \"and it's not something almost anyone knows about.\"\n\nThe illness is often confused with Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], which generally arrives just after the start of the monsoons and peaks in the fall, as it is spread by mosquitoes that breed in standing water. But this affliction starts a couple of months earlier and ends with the monsoon.\n\n\"This is a real mystery,\" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the CDC director, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not sure we'll be able to solve it, but at least we can unleash the best epidemiological tools we have to try to answer the question.\"\n\nDr. Chauhan's team has been given a rustic guesthouse next to a hospital here. There is no air-conditioning; the beds sag, and the electricity is fitful. But there is an urgency to the doctors' work. They gather almost every night in a small dining room to update crude posters with information about each case and debate their theories. A new virus, an old bacteria, litchis, alcoholic tree sap, heat, pesticides, rats, bats and sand flies are among the suspected causes.\n\nIn the nearby hospital, parents say in hushed tones that a ghost must be angry. Some paint black spots on siblings' foreheads to ward off the evil eye.\n\nGiven the suddenness with which the illness strikes, their superstition is understandable. At 11:30 p.m. on 10 Jun 2013, a 3-year-old boy was sleeping beside his mother and 2 brothers in their hut in the village of Ganti Vishanpur when he let out a scream and went into convulsions. The boy's father took him to a hospital. Several hours later, the boy's brother, age 5, screamed louder, convulsed and went limp. His panicked mother left her 2-month-old with a relative and took the boy to the hospital. Intensive medication and intravenous fluids stopped the boy's convulsions and cured his dehydration, said Dr. Mohan Kumar, a member of the team.\n\n\"I thought the child was O.K.,\" Dr. Kumar said [but] the 3 year old died that afternoon. His brother was moved to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, the region's best hospital, but one so overrun that its hallways are lined with sleeping patients, and its power blinks out almost hourly. Four days later, the father was still sitting beside the 5 year old's limp body, holding his hand.\n\nBut something the boys did, ate, drank, breathed in or encountered led to the 3 year old's death and the 5 year old's coma.\n\nInvestigators have collected samples of blood, urine and spinal fluid from each of this year's [2013] sick children -- there were 133, 59 of whom died -- and they asked their parents more than 150 questions about the children's food, water, sleeping arrangements and villages.\n\nSince cases tend to be isolated, the illness probably does not spread in the traditional person-to-person way, like the flu or tuberculosis. So the researchers are looking not only for the cause (virus, bacteria or toxin), but also for a carrier (rats, livestock or bats) and perhaps even for a vehicle (sand flies, drink or fruit). The investigation is like a highly complex puzzle in which every piece must be solved.\n\nA day in the field with Dr. Pandey revealed the magnitude of the task. It took him to a tiny cluster of brick-and-bamboo huts that made up the village of Chotta Sindhwari and the home of a 10-year-old boy hospitalized 2 weeks earlier with brain swelling. Dr. Pandey asked to see where he slept. His parents showed him a small room in a brick building with a mud floor, a bamboo roof and a wooden sleeping platform. Flies buzzed around; a young goat wandered in. Sacks of corn and rice, a magnet for rats, were piled near the bed. There was little ventilation, which could create excess heat. Mango, banana, palm and litchi trees were nearby. Dr. Pandey took notes on it all.\n\n[In the building,] 5 siblings slept on the platform, and there was mosquito netting above it. But the boy's mother said she sometimes found him sleeping on the mud floor outside the netting.\n\nWater came from a nearby pump. There was standing water with mosquito larvae, which Dr. Pandey collected in a small plastic bottle. They will be grown later for identification.\n\n\"This well is probably shallow, and they drink from it directly,\" Dr. Pandey said, making it a possible source of fecal contamination. Some have guessed that the disease is an intestinal virus carried in contaminated water. But patients with such infections usually have enlarged spleens, something not seen in the affected children, Dr. Pandey said.\n\nHe asked about the village's use of pesticides. (A separate team of environmental experts will soon test villages for pesticide and toxin residues.) He visited its grove of litchi trees. One theory is that infected bats contaminate the fruit, which ripen in May and June.\n\nAs if on cue, a cheerful old man walked through the grove carrying a clay pot of palm sap, which becomes mildly alcoholic in the summer heat. The pot was filled with a milky brew, dead insects and perhaps some bat feces and urine. Maybe children find a way to drink it, Dr. Pandey speculated, or their parents, inured to its effects, drink it and somehow pass along an infection.\n\nThen Dr. Pandey walked down the village's dirt road to find a random child of the 10 year old's age and perform the same survey. He was pursued by a pack of curious children, one of whom eventually stepped forward like an army recruit -- chest out, head up -- to answer the doctor's questions.\n\nThe village visit took 5 hours, and the study will need about 360 subjects. The epidemiologists say they have been working 14-hour days.\n\n\"I'm here until we finish,\" Dr. Pandey said.\n\n[Byline: Gardiner Harris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The reports of encephalitis (usually termed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India) continue to be confusing. The above report seems to rule out Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections on seasonal grounds, yet other reports in this and previous years of AES in northeastern India have been attributed in part or entirely to JEV infections. However, in some instances, JEV infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. A 1 Apr 2013 ProMED-mail report (archive no. 20130402.1615081) indicated that encephalitis cases had already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year (2013), totaling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as JEV infections. An additional report on 11 May 2013 (archive no. 20130628.1798059) stated that there were 24 cases of JEV encephalitis in Assam state this year [2013], along with 53 deaths due to encephalitis and 362 other cases of AES.\n\nIt seems curious that cases in Uttar Pradesh state have not been mentioned in the current report, as that has been a locality of a large number of reported JEV and AES cases in the past. There is no indication in these or previous reports this year (2013) whether individuals, especially the children, have been vaccinated recently against JEV infection. The arrival of the USA CDC team is good news indeed. With a vigorous field epidemiological study and the strong laboratory support of the CDC, one hopes that the etiology of these undefined AES cases can be resolved definitively.\n\nProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for sending in these and other related reports.\n\nMaps of India and Bihar state can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/r/77fN. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR): 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................dk/ty/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "tuberculosis", "encephalitis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2013-07-15 00:00:00", "1995-03-15 00:00:00", "1995-03-15 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2013-05-11 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Bihar", "country": "Hungary"}, {"location": "Muzaffarpur", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Assam", "country": "India"}, {"location": "West Bengal", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Nepal", "country": "Nepal"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1963818", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (16): (UP)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1963818", "date": "2013-07-14 21:13:44", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (10): (BEHAR)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 13 Jul 2013\nSource: New York Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/world/africa/as-mystery-illness-stalks-its-young-india-intensifies-search-for-a-killer.html?google_editors_picks=true&_r=0\n\n\nThe children begin arriving every year in mid-May, brought to an overburdened hospital here in one of India's most impoverished areas by their panic-stricken mothers.

A new virus, an old bacteria, litchis, alcoholic tree sap, heat, pesticides, rats, bats and sand flies are among the suspected causes.\n\nIn the nearby hospital, parents say in hushed tones that a ghost must be angry. Some paint black spots on siblings' foreheads to ward off the evil eye.\n\nGiven the suddenness with which the illness strikes, their superstition is understandable. At 11:30 p.m. on 10 Jun 2013, a 3-year-old boy was sleeping beside his mother and 2 brothers in their hut in the village of Ganti Vishanpur when he let out a scream and went into convulsions. The boy's father took him to a hospital. Several hours later, the boy's brother, age 5, screamed louder, convulsed and went limp. His panicked mother left her 2-month-old with a relative and took the boy to the hospital. Intensive medication and intravenous fluids stopped the boy's convulsions and cured his dehydration, said Dr. Mohan Kumar, a member of the team.\n\n\"I thought the child was O.K.,\" Dr. Kumar said [but] the 3 year old died that afternoon. His brother was moved to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, the region's best hospital, but one so overrun that its hallways are lined with sleeping patients, and its power blinks out almost hourly. Four days later, the father was still sitting beside the 5 year old's limp body, holding his hand.\n\nBut something the boys did, ate, drank, breathed in or encountered led to the 3 year old's death and the 5 year old's coma.\n\nInvestigators have collected samples of blood, urine and spinal fluid from each of this year's [2013] sick children -- there were 133, 59 of whom died -- and they asked their parents more than 150 questions about the children's food, water, sleeping arrangements and villages.\n\nSince cases tend to be isolated, the illness probably does not spread in the traditional person-to-person way, like the flu or tuberculosis. So the researchers are looking not only for the cause (virus, bacteria or toxin), but also for a carrier (rats, livestock or bats) and perhaps even for a vehicle (sand flies, drink or fruit). The investigation is like a highly complex puzzle in which every piece must be solved.\n\nA day in the field with Dr. Pandey revealed the magnitude of the task. It took him to a tiny cluster of brick-and-bamboo huts that made up the village of Chotta Sindhwari and the home of a 10-year-old boy hospitalized 2 weeks earlier with brain swelling. Dr. Pandey asked to see where he slept. His parents showed him a small room in a brick building with a mud floor, a bamboo roof and a wooden sleeping platform. Flies buzzed around; a young goat wandered in. Sacks of corn and rice, a magnet for rats, were piled near the bed. There was little ventilation, which could create excess heat. Mango, banana, palm and litchi trees were nearby. Dr. Pandey took notes on it all.\n\n[In the building,] 5 siblings slept on the platform, and there was mosquito netting above it. But the boy's mother said she sometimes found him sleeping on the mud floor outside the netting.\n\nWater came from a nearby pump. There was standing water with mosquito larvae, which Dr. Pandey collected in a small plastic bottle. They will be grown later for identification.\n\n\"This well is probably shallow, and they drink from it directly,\" Dr. Pandey said, making it a possible source of fecal contamination. Some have guessed that the disease is an intestinal virus carried in contaminated water. But patients with such infections usually have enlarged spleens, something not seen in the affected children, Dr. Pandey said.\n\nHe asked about the village's use of pesticides. (A separate team of environmental experts will soon test villages for pesticide and toxin residues.) He visited its grove of litchi trees. One theory is that infected bats contaminate the fruit, which ripen in May and June.\n\nAs if on cue, a cheerful old man walked through the grove carrying a clay pot of palm sap, which becomes mildly alcoholic in the summer heat. The pot was filled with a milky brew, dead insects and perhaps some bat feces and urine. Maybe children find a way to drink it, Dr. Pandey speculated, or their parents, inured to its effects, drink it and somehow pass along an infection.\n\nThen Dr. Pandey walked down the village's dirt road to find a random child of the 10 year old's age and perform the same survey. He was pursued by a pack of curious children, one of whom eventually stepped forward like an army recruit -- chest out, head up -- to answer the doctor's questions.\n\nThe village visit took 5 hours, and the study will need about 360 subjects. The epidemiologists say they have been working 14-hour days.\n\n\"I'm here until we finish,\" Dr. Pandey said.\n\n[Byline: Gardiner Harris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The reports of encephalitis (usually termed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India) continue to be confusing.

Seemingly healthy hours earlier, most have lapsed into a coma punctuated by convulsions.\n\nDoctors work to calm the convulsions and keep the children hydrated, but then have to watch helplessly along with the anguished parents as a 3rd of their young patients die, often within hours. Then, as suddenly as it started, the mysterious outbreak stops with the onset of the monsoon rains this month [July 2013]. No one knows why.\n\nThe mud-and-bamboo huts in this part of India cradle more dying children than anywhere in the world, with diarrhea and malnutrition long ranking as the region's great scourges. But now, this unknown killer is stalking the very young.\n\nAlthough public health statistics are unreliable here, the disease is believed to infect tens of thousands of people a year and kill thousands.\n\nAll doctors know is that the illness is a form of brain swelling, or encephalitis, but that is a huge category, covering a wide spectrum of diseases. Doctors have tested for known causes of brain swelling, including meningitis and Japanese encephalitis, but the tests almost always come back negative. India's top health officials say the disease, known officially as acute encephalitis syndrome, has them stumped.\n\n\"This outbreak happens every year, and we have not been able to identify the cause or link even a single factor responsible,\" Dr. L. S. Chauhan, the director of the National Center for Disease Control in India, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Chauhan hopes to change that. With help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, he started a program this year [2013] to train an elite cadre of disease sleuths, part of a recently organized Epidemic Intelligence Service in India, that he hopes will eventually undertake the investigations of India's estimated 1500 epidemics.\n\nBut the outbreak in Muzaffarpur is slowly spreading to neighboring areas, and Dr. Chauhan has thrown everything he can at it, assigning all 7 of his trainees, each already an accomplished physician. Experts from the C.D.C. are advising them, and their work is being closely followed by concerned officials in the United States.\n\nThe 1st reports of this mysterious illness date to 1995, when nearly 1000 children were sickened and 300 died in Muzaffarpur's 3 hospitals. Smaller epidemics have followed almost every year since.\n\nOfficials say they do not know whether the illness began in 1995 or had simply gone unnoticed before. Not only has it spread to nearby areas, but researchers have also recently found similar cases in neighboring Nepal. Some outbreaks in India have gone unreported because officials suppressed any mention for fear of prompting panic or criticism.\n\n\"India has a huge problem with encephalitis,\" said Dr. Rajesh Pandey, one of the epidemiologists camped out in Muzaffarpur, \"and it's not something almost anyone knows about.\"\n\nThe illness is often confused with Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], which generally arrives just after the start of the monsoons and peaks in the fall, as it is spread by mosquitoes that breed in standing water. But this affliction starts a couple of months earlier and ends with the monsoon.\n\n\"This is a real mystery,\" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the CDC director, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not sure we'll be able to solve it, but at least we can unleash the best epidemiological tools we have to try to answer the question.\"\n\nDr. Chauhan's team has been given a rustic guesthouse next to a hospital here.

But patients with such infections usually have enlarged spleens, something not seen in the affected children, Dr. Pandey said.\n\nHe asked about the village's use of pesticides. (A separate team of environmental experts will soon test villages for pesticide and toxin residues.) He visited its grove of litchi trees. One theory is that infected bats contaminate the fruit, which ripen in May and June.\n\nAs if on cue, a cheerful old man walked through the grove carrying a clay pot of palm sap, which becomes mildly alcoholic in the summer heat. The pot was filled with a milky brew, dead insects and perhaps some bat feces and urine. Maybe children find a way to drink it, Dr. Pandey speculated, or their parents, inured to its effects, drink it and somehow pass along an infection.\n\nThen Dr. Pandey walked down the village's dirt road to find a random child of the 10 year old's age and perform the same survey. He was pursued by a pack of curious children, one of whom eventually stepped forward like an army recruit -- chest out, head up -- to answer the doctor's questions.\n\nThe village visit took 5 hours, and the study will need about 360 subjects. The epidemiologists say they have been working 14-hour days.\n\n\"I'm here until we finish,\" Dr. Pandey said.\n\n[Byline: Gardiner Harris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The reports of encephalitis (usually termed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India) continue to be confusing. The above report seems to rule out Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections on seasonal grounds, yet other reports in this and previous years of AES in northeastern India have been attributed in part or entirely to JEV infections. However, in some instances, JEV infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. A 1 Apr 2013 ProMED-mail report (archive no. 20130402.1615081) indicated that encephalitis cases had already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year (2013), totaling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as JEV infections. An additional report on 11 May 2013 (archive no. 20130628.1798059) stated that there were 24 cases of JEV encephalitis in Assam state this year [2013], along with 53 deaths due to encephalitis and 362 other cases of AES.\n\nIt seems curious that cases in Uttar Pradesh state have not been mentioned in the current report, as that has been a locality of a large number of reported JEV and AES cases in the past. There is no indication in these or previous reports this year (2013) whether individuals, especially the children, have been vaccinated recently against JEV infection.

Seemingly healthy hours earlier, most have lapsed into a coma punctuated by convulsions.\n\nDoctors work to calm the convulsions and keep the children hydrated, but then have to watch helplessly along with the anguished parents as a 3rd of their young patients die, often within hours. Then, as suddenly as it started, the mysterious outbreak stops with the onset of the monsoon rains this month [July 2013]. No one knows why.\n\nThe mud-and-bamboo huts in this part of India cradle more dying children than anywhere in the world, with diarrhea and malnutrition long ranking as the region's great scourges. But now, this unknown killer is stalking the very young.\n\nAlthough public health statistics are unreliable here, the disease is believed to infect tens of thousands of people a year and kill thousands.\n\nAll doctors know is that the illness is a form of brain swelling, or encephalitis, but that is a huge category, covering a wide spectrum of diseases. Doctors have tested for known causes of brain swelling, including meningitis and Japanese encephalitis, but the tests almost always come back negative. India's top health officials say the disease, known officially as acute encephalitis syndrome, has them stumped.\n\n\"This outbreak happens every year, and we have not been able to identify the cause or link even a single factor responsible,\" Dr. L. S. Chauhan, the director of the National Center for Disease Control in India, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Chauhan hopes to change that. With help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, he started a program this year [2013] to train an elite cadre of disease sleuths, part of a recently organized Epidemic Intelligence Service in India, that he hopes will eventually undertake the investigations of India's estimated 1500 epidemics.\n\nBut the outbreak in Muzaffarpur is slowly spreading to neighboring areas, and Dr. Chauhan has thrown everything he can at it, assigning all 7 of his trainees, each already an accomplished physician. Experts from the C.D.C. are advising them, and their work is being closely followed by concerned officials in the United States.\n\nThe 1st reports of this mysterious illness date to 1995, when nearly 1000 children were sickened and 300 died in Muzaffarpur's 3 hospitals. Smaller epidemics have followed almost every year since.\n\nOfficials say they do not know whether the illness began in 1995 or had simply gone unnoticed before. Not only has it spread to nearby areas, but researchers have also recently found similar cases in neighboring Nepal. Some outbreaks in India have gone unreported because officials suppressed any mention for fear of prompting panic or criticism.\n\n\"India has a huge problem with encephalitis,\" said Dr. Rajesh Pandey, one of the epidemiologists camped out in Muzaffarpur, \"and it's not something almost anyone knows about.\"\n\nThe illness is often confused with Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], which generally arrives just after the start of the monsoons and peaks in the fall, as it is spread by mosquitoes that breed in standing water. But this affliction starts a couple of months earlier and ends with the monsoon.\n\n\"This is a real mystery,\" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the CDC director, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not sure we'll be able to solve it, but at least we can unleash the best epidemiological tools we have to try to answer the question.\"\n\nDr. Chauhan's team has been given a rustic guesthouse next to a hospital here. There is no air-conditioning; the beds sag, and the electricity is fitful. But there is an urgency to the doctors' work. They gather almost every night in a small dining room to update crude posters with information about each case and debate their theories. A new virus, an old bacteria, litchis, alcoholic tree sap, heat, pesticides, rats, bats and sand flies are among the suspected causes.\n\nIn the nearby hospital, parents say in hushed tones that a ghost must be angry. Some paint black spots on siblings' foreheads to ward off the evil eye.\n\nGiven the suddenness with which the illness strikes, their superstition is understandable. At 11:30 p.m. on 10 Jun 2013, a 3-year-old boy was sleeping beside his mother and 2 brothers in their hut in the village of Ganti Vishanpur when he let out a scream and went into convulsions. The boy's father took him to a hospital. Several hours later, the boy's brother, age 5, screamed louder, convulsed and went limp. His panicked mother left her 2-month-old with a relative and took the boy to the hospital. Intensive medication and intravenous fluids stopped the boy's convulsions and cured his dehydration, said Dr. Mohan Kumar, a member of the team.\n\n\"I thought the child was O.K.,\" Dr. Kumar said [but] the 3 year old died that afternoon. His brother was moved to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, the region's best hospital, but one so overrun that its hallways are lined with sleeping patients, and its power blinks out almost hourly. Four days later, the father was still sitting beside the 5 year old's limp body, holding his hand.\n\nBut something the boys did, ate, drank, breathed in or encountered led to the 3 year old's death and the 5 year old's coma.\n\nInvestigators have collected samples of blood, urine and spinal fluid from each of this year's [2013] sick children -- there were 133, 59 of whom died -- and they asked their parents more than 150 questions about the children's food, water, sleeping arrangements and villages.\n\nSince cases tend to be isolated, the illness probably does not spread in the traditional person-to-person way, like the flu or tuberculosis. So the researchers are looking not only for the cause (virus, bacteria or toxin), but also for a carrier (rats, livestock or bats) and perhaps even for a vehicle (sand flies, drink or fruit). The investigation is like a highly complex puzzle in which every piece must be solved.\n\nA day in the field with Dr. Pandey revealed the magnitude of the task. It took him to a tiny cluster of brick-and-bamboo huts that made up the village of Chotta Sindhwari and the home of a 10-year-old boy hospitalized 2 weeks earlier with brain swelling. Dr. Pandey asked to see where he slept. His parents showed him a small room in a brick building with a mud floor, a bamboo roof and a wooden sleeping platform. Flies buzzed around; a young goat wandered in. Sacks of corn and rice, a magnet for rats, were piled near the bed. There was little ventilation, which could create excess heat. Mango, banana, palm and litchi trees were nearby. Dr. Pandey took notes on it all.\n\n[In the building,] 5 siblings slept on the platform, and there was mosquito netting above it. But the boy's mother said she sometimes found him sleeping on the mud floor outside the netting.\n\nWater came from a nearby pump. There was standing water with mosquito larvae, which Dr. Pandey collected in a small plastic bottle. They will be grown later for identification.\n\n\"This well is probably shallow, and they drink from it directly,\" Dr. Pandey said, making it a possible source of fecal contamination. Some have guessed that the disease is an intestinal virus carried in contaminated water. But patients with such infections usually have enlarged spleens, something not seen in the affected children, Dr. Pandey said.\n\nHe asked about the village's use of pesticides.

Seemingly healthy hours earlier, most have lapsed into a coma punctuated by convulsions.\n\nDoctors work to calm the convulsions and keep the children hydrated, but then have to watch helplessly along with the anguished parents as a 3rd of their young patients die, often within hours. Then, as suddenly as it started, the mysterious outbreak stops with the onset of the monsoon rains this month [July 2013]. No one knows why.\n\nThe mud-and-bamboo huts in this part of India cradle more dying children than anywhere in the world, with diarrhea and malnutrition long ranking as the region's great scourges. But now, this unknown killer is stalking the very young.\n\nAlthough public health statistics are unreliable here, the disease is believed to infect tens of thousands of people a year and kill thousands.\n\nAll doctors know is that the illness is a form of brain swelling, or encephalitis, but that is a huge category, covering a wide spectrum of diseases. Doctors have tested for known causes of brain swelling, including meningitis and Japanese encephalitis, but the tests almost always come back negative. India's top health officials say the disease, known officially as acute encephalitis syndrome, has them stumped.\n\n\"This outbreak happens every year, and we have not been able to identify the cause or link even a single factor responsible,\" Dr. L. S. Chauhan, the director of the National Center for Disease Control in India, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Chauhan hopes to change that. With help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, he started a program this year [2013] to train an elite cadre of disease sleuths, part of a recently organized Epidemic Intelligence Service in India, that he hopes will eventually undertake the investigations of India's estimated 1500 epidemics.\n\nBut the outbreak in Muzaffarpur is slowly spreading to neighboring areas, and Dr. Chauhan has thrown everything he can at it, assigning all 7 of his trainees, each already an accomplished physician. Experts from the C.D.C. are advising them, and their work is being closely followed by concerned officials in the United States.\n\nThe 1st reports of this mysterious illness date to 1995, when nearly 1000 children were sickened and 300 died in Muzaffarpur's 3 hospitals. Smaller epidemics have followed almost every year since.\n\nOfficials say they do not know whether the illness began in 1995 or had simply gone unnoticed before. Not only has it spread to nearby areas, but researchers have also recently found similar cases in neighboring Nepal. Some outbreaks in India have gone unreported because officials suppressed any mention for fear of prompting panic or criticism.\n\n\"India has a huge problem with encephalitis,\" said Dr. Rajesh Pandey, one of the epidemiologists camped out in Muzaffarpur, \"and it's not something almost anyone knows about.\"\n\nThe illness is often confused with Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], which generally arrives just after the start of the monsoons and peaks in the fall, as it is spread by mosquitoes that breed in standing water. But this affliction starts a couple of months earlier and ends with the monsoon.\n\n\"This is a real mystery,\" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the CDC director, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not sure we'll be able to solve it, but at least we can unleash the best epidemiological tools we have to try to answer the question.\"\n\nDr. Chauhan's team has been given a rustic guesthouse next to a hospital here. There is no air-conditioning; the beds sag, and the electricity is fitful. But there is an urgency to the doctors' work. They gather almost every night in a small dining room to update crude posters with information about each case and debate their theories. A new virus, an old bacteria, litchis, alcoholic tree sap, heat, pesticides, rats, bats and sand flies are among the suspected causes.\n\nIn the nearby hospital, parents say in hushed tones that a ghost must be angry. Some paint black spots on siblings' foreheads to ward off the evil eye.\n\nGiven the suddenness with which the illness strikes, their superstition is understandable. At 11:30 p.m. on 10 Jun 2013, a 3-year-old boy was sleeping beside his mother and 2 brothers in their hut in the village of Ganti Vishanpur when he let out a scream and went into convulsions. The boy's father took him to a hospital. Several hours later, the boy's brother, age 5, screamed louder, convulsed and went limp. His panicked mother left her 2-month-old with a relative and took the boy to the hospital. Intensive medication and intravenous fluids stopped the boy's convulsions and cured his dehydration, said Dr. Mohan Kumar, a member of the team.\n\n\"I thought the child was O.K.,\" Dr. Kumar said [but] the 3 year old died that afternoon. His brother was moved to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, the region's best hospital, but one so overrun that its hallways are lined with sleeping patients, and its power blinks out almost hourly. Four days later, the father was still sitting beside the 5 year old's limp body, holding his hand.\n\nBut something the boys did, ate, drank, breathed in or encountered led to the 3 year old's death and the 5 year old's coma.\n\nInvestigators have collected samples of blood, urine and spinal fluid from each of this year's [2013] sick children -- there were 133, 59 of whom died -- and they asked their parents more than 150 questions about the children's food, water, sleeping arrangements and villages.\n\nSince cases tend to be isolated, the illness probably does not spread in the traditional person-to-person way, like the flu or tuberculosis. So the researchers are looking not only for the cause (virus, bacteria or toxin), but also for a carrier (rats, livestock or bats) and perhaps even for a vehicle (sand flies, drink or fruit). The investigation is like a highly complex puzzle in which every piece must be solved.\n\nA day in the field with Dr. Pandey revealed the magnitude of the task. It took him to a tiny cluster of brick-and-bamboo huts that made up the village of Chotta Sindhwari and the home of a 10-year-old boy hospitalized 2 weeks earlier with brain swelling. Dr. Pandey asked to see where he slept. His parents showed him a small room in a brick building with a mud floor, a bamboo roof and a wooden sleeping platform. Flies buzzed around; a young goat wandered in. Sacks of corn and rice, a magnet for rats, were piled near the bed. There was little ventilation, which could create excess heat. Mango, banana, palm and litchi trees were nearby. Dr. Pandey took notes on it all.\n\n[In the building,] 5 siblings slept on the platform, and there was mosquito netting above it. But the boy's mother said she sometimes found him sleeping on the mud floor outside the netting.\n\nWater came from a nearby pump. There was standing water with mosquito larvae, which Dr. Pandey collected in a small plastic bottle. They will be grown later for identification.\n\n\"This well is probably shallow, and they drink from it directly,\" Dr. Pandey said, making it a possible source of fecal contamination. Some have guessed that the disease is an intestinal virus carried in contaminated water. But patients with such infections usually have enlarged spleens, something not seen in the affected children, Dr. Pandey said.\n\nHe asked about the village's use of pesticides. (A separate team of environmental experts will soon test villages for pesticide and toxin residues.) He visited its grove of litchi trees. One theory is that infected bats contaminate the fruit, which ripen in May and June.\n\nAs if on cue, a cheerful old man walked through the grove carrying a clay pot of palm sap, which becomes mildly alcoholic in the summer heat. The pot was filled with a milky brew, dead insects and perhaps some bat feces and urine. Maybe children find a way to drink it, Dr. Pandey speculated, or their parents, inured to its effects, drink it and somehow pass along an infection.\n\nThen Dr. Pandey walked down the village's dirt road to find a random child of the 10 year old's age and perform the same survey. He was pursued by a pack of curious children, one of whom eventually stepped forward like an army recruit -- chest out, head up -- to answer the doctor's questions.\n\nThe village visit took 5 hours, and the study will need about 360 subjects. The epidemiologists say they have been working 14-hour days.\n\n\"I'm here until we finish,\" Dr. Pandey said.\n\n[Byline: Gardiner Harris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The reports of encephalitis (usually termed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India) continue to be confusing.

With a vigorous field epidemiological study and the strong laboratory support of the CDC, one hopes that the etiology of these undefined AES cases can be resolved definitively.\n\nProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for sending in these and other related reports.\n\nMaps of India and Bihar state can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/r/77fN. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS) 20130628.1798059\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (08): (BR) 20130616.1776275\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (07): (BR) RFI 20130610.1764062\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (BR): 20130601.1748963\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (AS) 20130514.1713488\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (04): (BR) 20130511.1706357\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (03): (BR) 20130501.1683457\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (UP, BR) 20130411.1638769\nJapanese encephalitis & other - India 20130402.1615081\n.................................................dk/ty/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "tuberculosis", "encephalitis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2013-07-15 00:00:00", "1995-03-15 00:00:00", "1995-03-15 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2013-05-11 00:00:00", "2013-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Bihar", "country": "Hungary"}, {"location": "Muzaffarpur", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Assam", "country": "India"}, {"location": "West Bengal", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Nepal", "country": "Nepal"}, {"location": "other - INDIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1798059", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Japanese encephalitis & other - India (09): (AS)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1798059", "date": "2013-04-11 15:53:54", "main_text": "JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS AND OTHER - INDIA (02): (UTTAR PRADESH, BIHAR)\n********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 10 Apr 2013\nSource: The Times of India [TOI], Times News Network (TNN) [edited]\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-10/lucknow/38433672_1_japanese-encephalitis-brd-medical-college-acute-encephalitis\n\n\nEncephalitis normally makes its presence felt during monsoons. However, this time, acute encephalitis has claimed 38 lives and affected 118 persons even before the onset of the disease season. This despite chief secretary Jawed Usmani issuing repeated directives to the state health department and officials posted in the districts to initiate preventive measures.\n\nEncephalitis is the inflammation of the brain caused by microbial agents such as bacteria and viruses. The cause of infection in [Indian] eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh [UP] and parts of Bihar, and Nepal is virus in 98 per cent of the patients. Encephalitis has killed children for [a] long [time], but the documentation work began in the mid 1970s. Earlier, the Arbo-B virus [flavivirus] was the cause of encephalitis and the disease was called Japanese encephalitis. After extensive vaccination campaigns, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis subsided. Still children continue to die. Researches have shown that the cause of encephalitis in about 45 per cent of the cases is not known.\n\nStatistics gathered from the health department show that of the total cases, 103 patients belonged to UP of whom 34 died.

What has pressed the panic button for the health department officials is that the case fatality rate for the 1st quarter of 2013 is significantly higher than that in 2012. Case fatality rate refers to the number of patients who die against those admitted. In the 1st quarter of 2012, as many as 26.9 per cent of the children suffering from AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] died, a growth of 33 per cent in 2013. Doctors at the communicable diseases unit of state health directorate believe that by the end of the year, the case fatality rate will subside.\n\nThe only silver lining is that the number of cases of Japanese encephalitis [has declined]. Experts at the Gorakhpur unit of National Institute of Virology give credit to the special vaccination drive against JE [Japanese encephalitis] for the low number of cases.

Although reports from this year (2012) and previous years implicates Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections in at least some of the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases, the report above rules out JEV infections in the current Bihar cases.

But local aid workers say efforts need to be stepped\nup. \"The infection started in the early 1970s and since then it has\nbecome an annual feature.

Around 347 people have died in the Indian state of Uttar\nPradesh, while 54 children have died in the neighbouring state of\nBihar. Over 2000 cases have been reported in the last 3 months.\n\n\"Acute encephalitis syndrome has 2 types of infections -- Japanese\nencephalitis [virus], which occurs due to mosquitoes, and enteroviral\nencephalitis, which is caused due to unsafe drinking water,\" said\nDinesh Kumar Srivastava from the Community Medicine Department in\nUttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district, where patients are receiving\ntreatment.\n\nOfficials said the main areas where the outbreak of the virus has been\nnoticed have been poor, flood-hit areas of the region, where this\nyear's [2011] monsoons have left pools of stagnant water that have\nallowed mosquitoes to breed and infect villagers. The floods have also\nled to the contamination of clean water sources such as wells, leaving\nmany people with no option but to use the same dirty water for both\ndrinking and sanitation. The infection spreads every year in\nimpoverished parts of Uttar Pradesh during the monsoon season,\nresulting in hundreds of deaths.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, viral encephalitis causes\nhigh fever, headache, stiff neck and back, vomiting, confusion and, in\nsevere cases, seizures, paralysis, and coma. Infants and elderly\npeople are particularly at risk of severe illness.\n\nOfficials say the government has earmarked 22 million rupees (USD 450\n000) to tackle problems like the unavailability of clean drinking\nwater, lack of sanitation, and water logging, to prevent the virus\nfrom spreading. But local aid workers say efforts need to be stepped\nup. \"The infection started in the early 1970s and since then it has\nbecome an annual feature. The government is adopting short term\nmeasures to deal with the infection instead of making any long term\nplan to get rid of the virus,\" said Sanjay Kumar Srivastava from\nAction for Peace, Prosperity and Liberty (APPL), a charity doing\nresearch on the disease. \"Besides, no preventive measures are taken to\nstop the outbreak,\" he added, suggesting that vaccinations be more\nreadily available to adults as well as to children.\n\n[Byline: Alka Pande, Nita Bhalla]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports of unspecified acute encephalitis syndrome\nimplicated contaminated water as a source of the infectious agent,\nsuggesting, without stating, that enteroviruses might be involved.

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

Department of Communicable Disease\nPrevention and Control, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, 2. Department of Virology, Sahlgrenska\nUniversity Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nClinical specimens from 79 symptomatic\nindividuals with a recent history of travel to\ncountries with verified transmission of influenza\nA(H1N1) virus (North America) were tested with a\nmultiple real-time PCR targeting a broad range of\nagents that may cause acute respiratory\ninfection. This analysis revealed that besides 4\ncases of influenza A(H1N1) virus, other\nrespiratory viruses were diagnosed in almost 60\npercent of the samples. These observations are a\nreminder that many different viral transmissions\noccur simultaneously in countries with ongoing\nspread of influenza A(H1N1) virus. The findings\ndemonstrate that the definition of suspected\ncases by clinical and epidemiological criteria\nhas only a poor capacity for discriminating\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v from other viral infections.\n\nBackground\n\nA new influenza A(H1N1) virus variant has spread\nglobally since its 1st appearance in April 2009\n[1,2] and as of 17 Jun 2009, there were 39 620\ncases reported by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [3]. On 30 Apr 2009, the European\nCommission suggested a case definition [4], which\nhas been adopted and modified by most authorities\nin the European Union Member States. In agreement\nwith this recommendation, testing for influenza A\nwas recommended in Sweden for cases with a\nclinical presentation including respiratory\nsymptoms and fever above 38 C and epidemiological\ncircumstances such as recent travel (within 7\ndays) to areas where the new influenza has been\nobserved [5] or close contact with confirmed\ncases.\n\nThe regular sentinel surveillance for seasonal\ninfluenza has been extended and now focuses on\nidentification of imported cases with influenza\nA(H1N1) virus, and on preventing secondary\ntransmission by contact tracing and antiviral\nmedication in an attempt to delay sustained\ncommunity transmission. In order to provide a\nbetter basis for the decision whether or not to\ninitiate preventive measures, expanded testing,\ntargeting a broad range of respiratory agents has\nbeen applied to specimens from all suspected\ncases in the region Vastra Gotaland (1.5 million\ninhabitants). We report here the results of this\nexpanded testing.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThis report includes samples of patients who,\nduring the period from 24 Apr to 10 Jun 2009\npresented with influenza-like symptoms and a\nhistory of recent travel to the United States or\nMexico, and therefore were recommended for\nexamination and sampling. This clinical\nexamination was performed by infectious disease\nclinicians on call at Sahlgrenska University\nHostpital/\u00d6stra in Gothenburg, and our report is\nbased on their evaluation and laboratory results.\nIn summary, of all 79 patients included with a\ntravel history, 90 percent presented with\nrespiratory symptoms, 5 percent without\nrespiratory symptoms, and for the remaining 5\npercent this information is not documented. 66\npercent had fever above 38 C, 29 percent had no\nfever; information on fever was missing for 5\npercent. Nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to the\nmolecular diagnostic unit at the virological\nlaboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for\ntesting by a multiple real-time PCR targeting 13\nviruses and 2 bacteria, !\nrun in 6 parallel multiplex PCRs on an ABI 7500\ninstrument [6]. Samples that were reactive for\nthe influenza A component (matrix protein target,\n[7]) of this PCR were subtyped by an additional\nreal-time PCR targeting the haemagglutinin gene,\nrun in 3 parallel reactions specific for the H3N2\nand H1N1 subtypes that have been circulating for\na long time, as well as for the new H1N1v strain.\n[Readers requiring information on the primers and\nprobes used in the real-time PCR are referred to\na Table in the original text].\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIn total, samples from 79 patients were tested\n(42 males, 37 females; median age 30 years, range\n1-75 years), with between 10 and 16 samples on\naverage each week and most of them taken from\npatients with respiratory symptoms and a history\nof recent travel to North America. Four cases\nwith the new influenza A (H1N1)v variant were\ndiagnosed. Interestingly, in 56 percent of the\ncases, other aetiologies were identified (Table).\n\nTable. Viral aetiologies for the patients\nfulfilling definition of suspected cases of\ninfluenza A(H1N1)v, Region Vastra Gotaland,\nSweden, Apr-Jun 2009 (n=79)\n\nViral aetiology / Number / Percentage\n\nRhinovirus / 28 / 34\nCoronavirus / 8 / 10\nInfluenza B virus / 3 / 4\nHuman parainfluenza virus types 1-3 / 3 / 3 / 4\nAdenovirus / 2 / 2\nInfluenza A (H1N1) virus / 4 / 5\nMetapneumovirus / 1 / 1\nEnterovirus / 1 / 1\nRespiratory syncytial virus / 0 / 0\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae / 0 / 0\nNegative / 32 / 39\nTotal number / 82 / 100\n\n(Note: 3 patients had double infections with\nrhinovirus, together with enterovirus,\nmetapneumovirus or adenovirus.)\n\nThe most common finding was rhinovirus, observed\nin 28 of 82 cases (34 percent), and 3 of these\npatients also had a 2nd viral infection\n(enterovirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus).\nThe frequent identification of rhinovirus and\nother viruses demonstrates that the criteria for\nsuspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)v are\nrelevant as indicators of a viral infection, but\nnot specific for influenza A. On the other hand,\napplying more restrictive criteria would probably\nhave excluded most infections with the new\nA(H1N1) virus strain, considering that their\nclinical presentation has been reported to be\nrelatively mild. This illustrates a dilemma with\nsurveillance actions aiming at revealing the\nspread of new respiratory infections. If the\napplied criteria are too strict (for example\nfever above 39 C, cough and muscle pain), the\nepidemic is likely to be underestimated, because\nonly the severe cases are identified. If on the\nother hand the criteria are liberal, as\nillustrated by the cur!\nrent epidemic, most of the cases will probably\nhave other aetiologies. The positive predictive\nvalue of clinical criteria for identification of\ninfluenza A is particularly low in the early\nphase of an epidemic, when the incidence of\ninfluenza A is low, but will become relatively\nhigh during the peak when a large proportion of\nrespiratory infections will be due to influenza A\nvirus. The value of broad virology testing\ndecreases in the course of an influenza epidemic,\nwhen the detection rate of other aetiologies may\ndecrease from above 50 percent as observed in\nthis report to below 10 percent during the\ninfluenza peak (unpublished observations from our\nlaboratory).\n\nThe cases with influenza A were analysed further\nby a typing PCR that within 4-5 hours could\nidentify whether the strain was a traditional\nH1N1 or H3N2 virus, or the new H1N1 variant. This\ntyping system targets specific regions of the\nhaemagglutinin gene and has been developed in our\nlaboratory (unpublished). It has proved to have a\ngood sensitivity, as illustrated by cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values that are typically lower\nthan those obtained in the general PCR for\ninfluenza A, which targets a conserved region of\nthe matrix protein gene.\n\nThe results of the multiple PCR used in our\nsetting were available within 24 hours after\nsampling and served at the same time as\nconfirmation for the result of the 1st, general\ninfluenza A PCR. In cases that presented with\ntypical influenza-like symptoms but were negative\nfor influenza A in the 1st PCR, the finding of an\nalternative aetiology was helpful for the\ndecision to refrain from preventive measures.\nSuch measures include oseltamivir treatment of\npatients and influenza testing and prophylactic\ntreatment of their close contacts. The clinical\npractice was not always different, but in some\ncases, the identification of an alternative\naetiology such as rhinovirus was helpful for the\ndecision not to treat the patient of contacts,\neven when the patient had symptoms clearly\nindicative of possible influenza. From this\nexperience, we therefore conclude that a broad\ndiagnostic test is a valuable tool in the early\ninvestigation of a new emerging respiratory virus\nlike the new influ!\nenza A(H1N1)v.\n\n[Note added in proof: On 17 Jun 2009, Sweden\nchanged to a stricter case definition for\nsuspected cases. It now requires more than 2\nsymptoms besides epidemiology and fever.]\n\nReferences\n\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).
